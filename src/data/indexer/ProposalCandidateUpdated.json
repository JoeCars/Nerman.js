(w)stETH to rETH Treasury Diversification 🐮\n\n## Description\n\nFollowing the [recent proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320) to test CronFi’s TWAMM solution for [LST diversification](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10) of Nouns treasury, we at CoW Protocol would like to propose testing execution using our unique batch auction process before proceeding with the full 7k ETH amount. \n\nThere’s been interest in diversifying [Nouns DAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10), specifically stETH→rETH. Recently some twitter avatars have [posted](https://twitter.com/0x70626a/status/1684936056443969536) a good analysis of the 500 ETH TWAMM trade, specifically, that the trade resulted in 518.51 rETH received for 500 wstETH (a whopping 1.25% slippage for a stable swap!). We believe CoW Protocol will provide a much more competitive execution price, that is compatible with fair market prices.\n\n## Background\n\nCoW Protocol has been using a multi-token batch auction on Ethereum mainnet for over two years, facilitating [>$27.3B of trading volume](https://dune.com/cowprotocol/cowswap). CoW Protocol uniquely allows its users to get best execution prices even with a lax slippage tolerance thanks to 15 competitive solvers participating in an auction mechanism that protects the users by granting the right to execute the trade to the solver offering maximal price improvement.\n\nCoW Protocol is used by a [number of DAOs](https://cow.fi/daos) for their trading operations including ENS, Aave, Nexus Mutual, Gnosis, Karpatkey, Olympus DAO, Badger DAO, Yearn and more. \n\n## Advantages\n\nCoW Protocol pioneered intent-based trading since its inception in early 2021. This allows users to define order parameters without specifying the actual execution path (`calldata`). Users should expect the most optimised execution route to be chosen by the winning solver at the time of execution. \n\n## Considerations\n\nGiven a sell order of 500 wstETH→rETH there are several options for order placement that can provide different properties. We'll focus on a *TWAP* order setup although it seems to not be necessary in a smaller 500 ETH trade - the purpose is to demonstrate how a larger order could be set up.\n\nFor a 500 wstETH→rETH we propose to use a TWAP order of 5 equal parts worth 100 wstETH each. This may result in an execution up to 525 rETH.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJfUbBKo2.png)\n\n### `TWAP` Conditional order\n\n* Launch date: August 17th, 2023. [See twitter post.](https://twitter.com/CoWSwap/status/1692152855694803112?s=20)\n* Transactional volume: ~$4.2M. [See dune query](https://dune.com/cowprotocol/cow-swap-limit-orders-kpis).\n* Value held within `ExtensibleFallbackHandler`-upgraded Safes: ~$12.3M\n\nThe TWAP [implementation](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow) uses a constant limit price across each. Given the stability of wstETH→rETH, the limit price may be set in advance with a high confidence that this will be representative at the time the proposal is executed (and for the duration of the TWAP).\n\nOrder parameters suggested for this proposal:\n* Limit price: 1 wstETH = 1.038 rETH. This includes 1% slippage tolerance to allow for charging a fee from the sell token and to get higher confidence in execution. **It is still expected to be executed with a much lower slippage in practice.** See the above mentioned dune dashboard's *'order surplus'* whereby the order's slippage is protected.\n* 5 equal parts of 100 wstETH\n* Time intervals of two hours between parts \n\n## Methodology\n\nTo achieve this TWAP, the proposed transaction bundle will:\n\n1. Wrap the required `stETH` to `wstETH` so that it may be traded.\n2. Create a `Safe` owned by the DAO treasury that is used as a staging contract for the TWAP.\n3. Trigger the TWAP, with the resulting `rETH` from each swap being sent directly back to the DAO treasury.\n\n### Use of `Safe`\n\n* Developers: `Safe`\n* Audits: [See their Github Repository](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/tree/af488f0a649a3be2ea01e0f7a6af1587d0250c2d/docs).\n\nThe `Safe` is used as a staging area for the funds used in the TWAP. As CoW Protocol uses intent based trading, the `owner` of the order needs to sign their intent (done using a private key for an `EOA`, done using [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) for a smart contract). \n\nWith this requirement in mind, the DAO treasury contract for Nouns doesn't support EIP-1271. This is why a `Safe` is used in combination with `ComposableCoW` (detailed below).\n\nThe `Safe` that is created in the proposal bundle **ensures that the only owner is set to the DAO Treasury**. At all times, the funds remain under the direct control of the DAO treasury with the same timelock conditions.\n\n#### Execution Risk\n\nIn the transaction bundle funds are sent atomically to a newly created `Safe`. This means that the `Safe`'s address needs to be calculated beforehand. This is done using `CREATE2` logic, therefore the `Safe` is created at a deterministic address. The flow:\n\n1. DAO Treasury sets an approval on `wstETH` for the to-be-created `Safe`.\n2. The `Safe` is created and initialised.\n3. The funds are **PULLED** from the DAO Treasury to the `Safe`.\n\nCritically, with the above methodology there is *no ability for funds to be sent to an address where they are not retrievable*.\n\n**CAUTION:** This candidate proposal assumes successful passage of [Proposal #359](https://nouns.wtf/vote/359) **AND** no intermediate proposal that interacts with the new treasury's balance of `wstETH`.\n\n### Use of `ComposableCoW` / `TWAP`\n\n* Developer: mfw78 (funded by CowDAO Grants Program, and now a [Core Contributor to CoW Protocol](https://snapshot.org/#/cowgrants.eth/proposal/0x0202a88c6792d1bd1e534cf1da94769130f495e72247e666b4afff8b22da9db0)).\n* Audits (jointly funded by `Safe` and CoW Protocol): [Ackee](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow/blob/main/audits/ackee-blockchain-cow-protocol-composablecow-extensiblefallbackhandler-report-1.2.pdf), [Gnosis Internal](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow/blob/main/audits/gnosis-ComposableCoWMayJul2023.pdf).\n* Other: Repository recently on-boarded to [CoW Protocol GitHub organisation](https://github.com/cowprotocol/).\n\n`ComposableCoW` is a conditional smart order framework that was [incubated by the CoW Grants Program](https://snapshot.org/#/cowgrants.eth/proposal/0xb7815ca1f5aea2ec537295fd452332680eb1be379f3356950dc8ba151d83f9c5). `TWAP` is an order type implemented in the `ComposableCoW` framework. The contracts are thoroughly tested and audited. To date, volume processed exceeds ~$4.2M.\n\nUsing `ComposableCoW`, a smart contract (such as the `Safe` deployed in the proposal) is able to autonomously indicate its intent to trade. This intent is monitored by a *Watch Tower* (currently a Tenderly Web3 Action, deployed by the CoW Protocol team), with the intent relayed to the CoW Protocol API. In this framework - for TWAP, unlike `Milkman` - the smart contract specifies the *entire order structure to be submitted to the API*. There are no trust assumptions placed in the Watch Tower (besides the Watch Tower not running, leading to a griefing attack, but CoW Protocol for reputational reasons are incentivised to keep the Watch Tower operational).\n\n#### Differences compared to `Milkman`\n\nBoth were funded by the CoW Protocol Grants Program. `Milkman` seeks to solve the issue of an autonomous swap from ABC→XYZ tokens, whereas `ComposableCoW` provides an entire framework for producing *conditional* orders. TWAP is an example of a conditional order built with this framework - allowing a large trade to settle in multiple parts over time, minimising price impact.\n\n## Proposal Operations\n\nThe operations in the proposal are:\n\n1.

I’m a [micro-sculpturist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YOdH2wqL9M) and I hold the record for creating the [world’s smallest sculpture](https://www.willardwiganmbe.com/world-records). \n\n![hello](https://i.imgur.com/KEcTQNg.png)\n![youtube](https://i.imgur.com/1afCMCC.png)\n\nGrowing up for me was a little hard. I wasn’t too good at reading or writing as my autism and dyslexia made it incredibly difficult. Luckily, I was able to discover my hidden talent for creating small sculptures and since then I’ve achieved things I never thought I could. \n\nThis brings me to Nouns - I love how you all support the creative arts with your treasury. My [foundation](https://www.thewiganfoundation.com/) is heavily focused on helping the youth to find FAAIR - Focus, Awe, Ambition, Inspiration, Resilience. Many of the projects and people in your community reflect the ideals that I strive to instill in the youth and that gets me excited to make this proposal to you all.\n\nFor this proposal, I want to turn the Noggles into one of my signature micro-sculptures. This will take me 9~ weeks to create. When I finish the sculpture, I will encase it in acrylic and place it in a custom Nouns-themed magnifying box. The 3 Noun candidates that sponsor this proposal will have their Nouns permanently engraved on the box.\n\n![tiny](https://i.imgur.com/ZeWpibE.png)\n![candidates](https://i.imgur.com/JTFzn0T.png)\n\nTo make these sculptures, I hold my breath to slow down my heart rate and chisel in-between my heartbeats. Sometimes I use the tremors caused by my heartbeat to jackhammer the material. Much like how the Nouns are sculpting an infinite art piece with every onchain proposal, every vote and every Noun created every day.\n\n![offer](https://i.imgur.com/9NCFQPx.png)\n\nI’m requesting 75 ETH to bring the Noggles micro-sculpture to life. The money will go directly to my foundation where it will not only fund me to continue my life’s work, but also help the neurodiverse youth of the world.","slug":"noggles-a-micro-sculpture-by-dr-willard-wigan-mbe","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0x2247df173522ca869dc00e023d410b84df00fdd77a3cc2c1686f8a8c8c9259f4","reason":""},{"blockNumber":18097884,"blockHash":"0x5762c859e6e343c2b6c0e3ccade024e9ecf6a4c5f62fb0d1dea7c18c55d286ec","transactionIndex":96,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0xc6ae1523ff79682515fceab1e0bf71e9ff804511804e23957577b28d57d870ad","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0x8d2B28265bEE1C926433A25D951adb03De9Ab275","targets":["0x8AE80e0B44205904bE18869240c2eC62D2342785"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"description":"# Commercialization of the \"Noggle Changer\"!⌐◨-◨\n\n# TL;DR\n- We aim to launch the real Noggles brand \"Noggle Changer\" in Japan.\n- Target product launch: December 2023 - January 2024.\n- Allocate 50% of sales to the treasury, with the remaining 50% as additional operational funding for this project.\n- Increase Nouns⌐◨-◨ market recognition through sales.\n- The future vision of the “Noggle Changer” aims to achieve both social value and revenue.\n# Firstly\n▶**This proposal has been revised based on the feedback** received for the proposal submitted as a candidate.\n▶Attached as separate documents, you will find a report on the background of this project and my experiences. \n⇒[**Project Origins: How My Experience Fuels Our Vision**](https://eibakatsu.com/noggle_changer/Project_Origins__How_My_Experience_Fuels_Our_Vision.pdf) \n\n# Our Strengths\n![Noggles.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1145970007218589736/1145977088457850920/Noggles.jpg)\n## Support from Japan's Nouns Community\nNouns is one of the most popular NFT IPs in Japan, attracting many people to the allure of Noggles. \nSubDAOs like [**pNouns**](https://twitter.com/pNounsOFFICIAL) , [**NounsDAO Japan**](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOJAPAN), and [**NOUNS BASE**](https://twitter.com/KURAN_Nouns) have spontaneously formed, each with several hundred participants in their respective communities. \nWith such a substantial community presence, it becomes feasible to market real Noggles to the general public through a brand strategy.\n\n## Product Differentiation \n### Dedication to Refined Design and Craftsmanship\nIn collaboration with [**KISSO Corporation**.](https://kissojapan.com/) , we have meticulously crafted a prototype by faithfully reproducing the dimensions of Nouns' ⌐◨-◨.\n* **Sustainable Material:** Cellulose acetate for quality and sustainability.\n* **Commanding Design:** Front design, two-tone lenses, thicker temples.\n* **Comfort:** Features like arms and nose pads for extended wear comfort.\n* **Color:** Palette based on prototype feedback.\n* **Affordable Pricing:** Enhancing accessibility to a wider audience.\n# The Background of the Brand\n![NoggleChanger.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1145970007218589736/1145978969032765450/NoggleChanger.png)\n\nMy organization, pNouns, introduced **Proposal 228** which received support from Nouns DAO.\n**I was responsible for overseeing the prototyping and development of the product.**\nThe prototype noggle received significant **positive feedback**. \nWe believe that real noggle can build a substantial fanbase, and **we are planning to bring “Noggle Changer” to market.**\n\n# Brand Design\n## ▼ Logo Concept\n![NoggleChanger_logo.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1145970007218589736/1145977825963286588/NoggleChanger_logo.png)\n\n## ▼ Product Description\n**Components:** Outer box, hard case, cloth, main body\n**Material:** Cellulose acetate\n**Colors:** 4 colors(Red, Gray, Yellow, Green)\n**Size:** Unisex\n**Retail Price:** 0.08 ETH (excluding shipping expenses)\n**Production Quantity:** 500 units (100 units reserved for management, etc.)\n\n![pNounsNoggles_imgA.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1145970007218589736/1145977993601241179/pNounsNoggles_imgA.png)\n\n## Co-branding with Creators\nThe product packaging will feature artwork by **[@KURAN](https://twitter.com/KURAN_Nouns)**, the creator of the NFT Collection **\"NOUNS BASE\"**,thereby augmenting the allure and worth of the product.

There is no physical delivery on this support.)\n\n## **Concept**\n\nA defining underground force in menswear in the 2010s, Palace here echoes the new and weirdness of Nouns through a series of pieces that will hybridize their creative universes – inherently Italian, boldly new, translated anew. The initial inspiration will be built on the Palace catalog itself and on the undeniable influence of Nouns on nft culture.\n\n## **Introduction**\n\n[Palace Skateboards](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) needs little introduction, but for the uninitiated, the London-based skateboarding and clothing brand has become a mainstay in the streetwear scene for incorporating 1990s and pop culture influences with their VHS-style clothing ads. In other words, it’s kitsch, cool, and everything in between.\n\n# **Why Palace?**\n\n[Palace](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) began as a brand for skateboarders. It is now a brand for all. Models turn up for castings in Palace. Working class Glasgow dads sport Palace. Jay-Z wears Palace. So does Rihanna. Teenage girls sleep in Palace, dreaming of the heart-throbs they’ve seen wearing Palace online. 2018’s Wimbledon finalists played on court in Palace. Soundcloud rappers adore Palace. The ICA exhibits Palace. Serious DJs with peerless techno collections adorn their record boxes with Palace stickers. Ravers ingest ecstasy pills produced in the shape of Palace’s Tri-Ferg logo. Socio-political causes, including the plights of both Jeremy Corbyn and the people of Palestine, have been smartly memed in versions of the Palace triangle.\n\nA middle-aged architect can slyly intimate he has better kids than his colleagues by picking something up at Palace, even if it’s just their socks. Virgil Abloh and Marc Jacobs wear Palace. London tube station walls are adorned by carriage-length adverts for Palace. The bigwigs at Ralph Lauren were so taken by the irrepressible rise of Palace that Palace became its first ever collaborator in 50 years of singularly myth-making fashion history.\n![](https://imgur.com/dlwqvv6.gif)\n![](https://imgur.com/OEHdbcQ.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/KsVOGlC.gif)\nFashion’s favourite photographers Alasdair McLellan, Juergen Teller and David Sims shoot for Palace. Silicon Valley is full of people in Palace. Blue-chip stylists buy Palace from their own pocket money to lend their imagery some of the company’s off-rail styles and indigenous London magic. i-D and British Vogue carry Palace ads. Madonna and child (Rocco) have been photographed proudly wearing Palace. All the while, a fat lad on a Midlands housing estate is looking great and feeling even greater in Palace while waiting for his Chinese takeaway and playing Fortnite.\n\n## Strength in Numbers\n\nThe large take on several already-created collaborations and communication from other brands to the nft audience is an excellent entry point for the brand to reach fans and a new market. Likewise, for the Nouns community;  **significant increases in brand awareness, favorability for further collaborations, and open public interest in the brand, consequently becomes a win-win.** To highlight the ROI of the collaboration, let's look at promoting the Palace brand among your collaborations;\n\n[Gucci](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjsKDzipOtF), [Mercedes](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CbXyjVPq0VI), [New Balance](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cr-s3WotGz1), [Adidas](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoHewHju2Ii), [RIMOWA](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoUlcMeqvAs), and many others.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/qCpbrcS.jpg)\n[PALACE JAPAN MAGAZINE](https://www.palaceskateboards.com/range/spring-2019/palace-japan-magazine/)\n\n**Approach**: Use public communication-powered resources to compare social media posts containing mentions of the Palace and Nouns brand, before and after the partnership.\n\"Outcome: Insight into the Marketing ROI of an NFT Dive from Palace\" **“ Significantly increases the reach of Nouns by talking to two sets of customers instead of one and gives a signal from one brand that the other brand is trusted by the upscale market.”**\n\n## Breakdown of legal conditions\n\n**Strategy**: Legal terms and already transcribed collaboration construction.\n\n(the terms below will be robustly written to avoid legal inconvenience)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/fPYHHdj.jpg)\n\n• Recreate the look and feel of the Palace collaborative product; designing new products for that collaboration; concentrated on multiple tacit marketing and management ideas that they share.\n\n• Synthetic and the built committee will be responsible for co-managing the community outreach and communication campaign during construction.\n\n• Creative control, both teams have to work within the decided parameters and cannot go beyond that and after each step, they must report to the other brand.\n\n• Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace team's design and construction team. (This is due to several cordial agreements that the brand already has with the media – Vogue, WWD, Hypebeast and others.)\n\n• Nouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\n• Building a capsule\nA capsule collection is essentially a condensed version of a designer's vision/collaboration, often in limited edition, that transcends seasons and trends by being functional. Thus, focusing on building and delivering key looks, without the style and theatricality of a fashion show.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/5qLsHLr.jpg)\n\n**Nouns Palace will be a 5-item capsule.**\n\n**Important: The data below is for a better visualization of what will be built in the second phase. The numbers are base numbers, discussed in the first meetings, therefore they are changeable.**\n\nThe total supply of the collection will be approximately ~6000 pieces, divided between three distinct pieces of clothing, palace noogles, and skate decks.\n\n• clothing number 1 \n• clothing number 2\n• clothing number 3 \n\n• Noggles Palace =\n\n• Deck 1\n• Deck 2\n\n**a % (percentage) of collection sales will be directed to the NounsDAO Treasury.**\n\n## Transparency and Confidential Terms\n\nDetailed legal processes and collaboration building over the next four months;\n\n• Recitals\n• Purpose\n• Confidentiality Clause\n• Commercial Clause\n• Investment Clause\n• Duties and Obligations of Collaborators\n• Reporting and Project Management\n• Intellectual Property Rights\n\n• Fashion product mix;\n• Creation and style;\n• Prototyping;\n• Product development;\n• Marketing and Sales Strategy;\n• Collection management;\n• Evaluation of results.\n\n**Accountability**\n\nForm a Steering Committee: composed of [DeGenData](https://twitter.com/degendata), [Ccarella](https://twitter.com/ccarella), [Oni-apenoun](https://twitter.com/apenoun) and 1 other noun who have intimate knowledge of the brands present in the collaboration.\n\nProvide this committee with **frequent updates on clauses, legal terms, construction and execution of the collaboration.**\n \n  \n![](https://imgur.com/aQHXdNh.jpg)\n \n  \n# **FAQ**\n\n• Will there be any activation exclusively for noun holders?\n\nYes, one of the reasons for building a capsule is that it is more malleable to community based implementations.\n\n• Will the capsule be made available globally?\n\nYes, with the exception of one item that will be available exclusively in certain regions.\n\n• Will sales also be available in physical stores?\n\nNouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n• Does this proposal cover actually creating the capsule? So the end result is ultimately Palace x Nouns clothes I can buy online?\n\nThis proposal covers the consolidation of legal terms, as well as the construction of the idealization/concept for creating the capsule. The construction with already defined direction and execution of the capsule will start in phase two (second support).\n\n## Funding Request\n\nOperations & Admin Compensation - €47.000 \n\n• Compensation + fees for 4 Months of two full-time synthetic team members. €37.600\n       **(€4700 per member/month)**\n       \nSteering Committee Stipend - €16000\n\n• Compensation for the four members for 4 months.\n        **(€1000 per member/month)**\n\n• Committee - [DeGenData](https://twitter.com/degendata), [Ccarella](https://twitter.com/ccarella), [Oni-apenoun](https://twitter.com/apenoun)\n\nLegal expenses - €15400\n\n• Lawyer consulting on clauses clauses established by Palace\n\n**Total: €78400 = 52ETH**\n\n**With the execution of the first phase, a new proposal will be sent with details and construction of the MFG (second phase).**\n\n# **Conclusion**\n    \n**• A collaboration is being established between Palace and Nouns.**\n\n**• The request for this support covers compensation for the next four months of the team and legal processes and the construction of the ideation and detailing of the designer's capsule/collection.**\n\n**• There is no physical delivery of this support.**\n\n**• Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace project team.**\n\n**• The importance of this collaboration for Nouns is absolute, where you have a conversation between two audiences, one of which is global.**\n\n**• The specific amount of mass production of capsule items is still under study and will be detailed in the second support raised for the second phase.**\n\n\n# **Team:**\n\n[Synthetic](https://twitter.com/synthetic_eth) **: project dedicated to the creation and transmission connections.

These gifs and stickers will be communicative, humorous and **relatable** with the aim of reaching a wider audience with Nouns characters and encouraging their recurring use.\n\n## Goal\n\nThe goal is to make GIFs that people both inside and outside the world of nouns can use. This way, they'll start incorporating nouns into their **daily lives**. Plus, GIFs are currently one of the most viral forms of content because their primary purpose is to be shared to convey an idea, emotion, or joke.\n\n![alt text](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExd2kycWx5YWR1MTRyeXdhcmRlMzI0ZGI5Z3k2cG1yZGZiNzY5cjBkYSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/MKr18qpDptEKhk6yWp/giphy.gif)\n\n## Pudgy Penguins\n\nA successful case we can take as a reference is  \"Pudgy Penguins\" Gif collection.

It's a clever strategy to enhance familiar images by adding the noggles on top of them. However, most regular folks probably don't know what these \"noggles\" are. That's why these GIFs introduce the characters behind the \"nooggles\" brand. These will complement the current ones beautifully!\n\n![alt text](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNm8wZHk1OHBpYzIxaWJvOWd6ZW53MWd4ZnNiMDBhM2t3Z3ZxbGVkcyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/5DKoUvpIwMLPCMpr1v/giphy.gif)\n\n## Team\n\nTo carry out this proposal, I'll be teaming up with my friend and colleague Santiago Pereyra.

The initial inspiration will be built on the Palace catalog itself and on the undeniable influence of Nouns on nft culture.\n\n## **Introduction**\n\n[Palace Skateboards](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) needs little introduction, but for the uninitiated, the London-based skateboarding and clothing brand has become a mainstay in the streetwear scene for incorporating 1990s and pop culture influences with their VHS-style clothing ads. In other words, it’s kitsch, cool, and everything in between.\n\n# **Why Palace?**\n\n[Palace](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) began as a brand for skateboarders. It is now a brand for all. Models turn up for castings in Palace. Working class Glasgow dads sport Palace. Jay-Z wears Palace. So does Rihanna. Teenage girls sleep in Palace, dreaming of the heart-throbs they’ve seen wearing Palace online. 2018’s Wimbledon finalists played on court in Palace. Soundcloud rappers adore Palace. The ICA exhibits Palace. Serious DJs with peerless techno collections adorn their record boxes with Palace stickers. Ravers ingest ecstasy pills produced in the shape of Palace’s Tri-Ferg logo. Socio-political causes, including the plights of both Jeremy Corbyn and the people of Palestine, have been smartly memed in versions of the Palace triangle.\n\nA middle-aged architect can slyly intimate he has better kids than his colleagues by picking something up at Palace, even if it’s just their socks. Virgil Abloh and Marc Jacobs wear Palace. London tube station walls are adorned by carriage-length adverts for Palace. The bigwigs at Ralph Lauren were so taken by the irrepressible rise of Palace that Palace became its first ever collaborator in 50 years of singularly myth-making fashion history.\n![](https://imgur.com/dlwqvv6.gif)\n![](https://imgur.com/OEHdbcQ.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/KsVOGlC.gif)\nFashion’s favourite photographers Alasdair McLellan, Juergen Teller and David Sims shoot for Palace. Silicon Valley is full of people in Palace. Blue-chip stylists buy Palace from their own pocket money to lend their imagery some of the company’s off-rail styles and indigenous London magic. i-D and British Vogue carry Palace ads. Madonna and child (Rocco) have been photographed proudly wearing Palace. All the while, a fat lad on a Midlands housing estate is looking great and feeling even greater in Palace while waiting for his Chinese takeaway and playing Fortnite.\n\n## Strength in Numbers\n\nThe large take on several already-created collaborations and communication from other brands to the nft audience is an excellent entry point for the brand to reach fans and a new market. Likewise, for the Nouns community;  **significant increases in brand awareness, favorability for further collaborations, and open public interest in the brand, consequently becomes a win-win.** To highlight the ROI of the collaboration, let's look at promoting the Palace brand among your collaborations;\n\n[Gucci](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjsKDzipOtF), [Mercedes](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CbXyjVPq0VI), [New Balance](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cr-s3WotGz1), [Adidas](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoHewHju2Ii), [RIMOWA](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoUlcMeqvAs), and many others.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/qCpbrcS.jpg)\n[PALACE JAPAN MAGAZINE](https://www.palaceskateboards.com/range/spring-2019/palace-japan-magazine/)\n\n**Approach**: Use public communication-powered resources to compare social media posts containing mentions of the Palace and Nouns brand, before and after the partnership.\n\"Outcome: Insight into the Marketing ROI of an NFT Dive from Palace\" **“ Significantly increases the reach of Nouns by talking to two sets of customers instead of one and gives a signal from one brand that the other brand is trusted by the upscale market.”**\n\n## Breakdown of legal conditions\n\n**Strategy**: Legal terms and already transcribed collaboration construction.\n\n(the terms below will be robustly written to avoid legal inconvenience)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/fPYHHdj.jpg)\n\n• Recreate the look and feel of the Palace collaborative product; designing new products for that collaboration; concentrated on multiple tacit marketing and management ideas that they share.\n\n• Synthetic and the built committee will be responsible for co-managing the community outreach and communication campaign during construction.\n\n• Creative control, both teams have to work within the decided parameters and cannot go beyond that and after each step, they must report to the other brand.\n\n• Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace team's design and construction team. (This is due to several cordial agreements that the brand already has with the media – Vogue, WWD, Hypebeast and others.)\n\n• Nouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\n• Building a capsule\nA capsule collection is essentially a condensed version of a designer's vision/collaboration, often in limited edition, that transcends seasons and trends by being functional. Thus, focusing on building and delivering key looks, without the style and theatricality of a fashion show.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/5qLsHLr.jpg)\n\n**Nouns Palace will be a 5-item capsule.**\n\n**Important: The data below is for a better visualization of what will be built in the second phase. The numbers are base numbers, discussed in the first meetings, therefore they are changeable.**\n\nThe total supply of the collection will be approximately ~6000 pieces, divided between three distinct pieces of clothing, palace noogles, and skate decks.\n\n• clothing number 1 \n• clothing number 2\n• clothing number 3 \n\n• Noggles Palace =\n\n• Deck 1\n• Deck 2\n\n**a % (percentage) of collection sales will be directed to the NounsDAO Treasury.**\n\n## Transparency and Confidential Terms\n\nDetailed legal processes and collaboration building over the next four months;\n\n• Recitals\n• Purpose\n• Confidentiality Clause\n• Commercial Clause\n• Investment Clause\n• Duties and Obligations of Collaborators\n• Reporting and Project Management\n• Intellectual Property Rights\n\n• Fashion product mix;\n• Creation and style;\n• Prototyping;\n• Product development;\n• Marketing and Sales Strategy;\n• Collection management;\n• Evaluation of results.\n\n## Building in public\n\n**There is no precedent for similar proposals in Nouns**, a collaboration like this creates demand for interaction and content that can be used by other builders and future collaborations.\n\nMany of the processes built to reach an agreement with a corporate are extremely tiring and even building their direction and a good presentation, most corporations prioritize closed and legal agreements to add clauses and prioritize their Intellectual Property.\n\n• Create a [general structure](https://mirror.xyz/0x905Ca7a9479EA1B9a8CDeD74da98e3CC5E6E2949) together with lawyer consulting to detail the collaboration and develop material to serve as a reference for other builders.\n\n**Accountability**\n\nForm a Steering Committee: composed of [DeGenData](https://twitter.com/degendata), [Ccarella](https://twitter.com/ccarella), [Oni-apenoun](https://twitter.com/apenoun) and 1 other noun who have intimate knowledge of the brands present in the collaboration.\n\nProvide this committee with **frequent updates on clauses, legal terms, construction and execution of the collaboration.**\n \n  \n![](https://imgur.com/aQHXdNh.jpg) \n  \n# **FAQ**\n\n• Will there be any activation exclusively for noun holders?\n\nYes, one of the reasons for building a capsule is that it is more malleable to community based implementations.\n\n• Will the capsule be made available globally?\n\nYes, with the exception of one item that will be available exclusively in certain regions.\n\n• Will sales also be available in physical stores?\n\nNouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n• Does this proposal cover actually creating the capsule? So the end result is ultimately Palace x Nouns clothes I can buy online?\n\nThis proposal covers the consolidation of legal terms, as well as the construction of the idealization/concept for creating the capsule. The construction with already defined direction and execution of the capsule will start in phase two (second support).\n\n## Funding Request\n\nOperations & Admin Compensation - €47.000 \n\n• Compensation + fees for 4 Months of two full-time synthetic team members. €37.600\n       **(€4700 per member/month)**\n       \nSteering Committee Stipend - €16000\n\n• Compensation for the four members for 4 months.\n        **(€1000 per member/month)**\n\n• Committee - [DeGenData](https://twitter.com/degendata), [Ccarella](https://twitter.com/ccarella), [Oni-apenoun](https://twitter.com/apenoun)\n\nLegal expenses - €15400\n\n• Lawyer consulting on clauses clauses established by Palace\n\n**Total: €78400 = 52ETH**\n\n**With the execution of the first phase, a new proposal will be sent with details and construction of the MFG (second phase).**\n\n# **Conclusion**\n    \n**• A collaboration is being established between Palace and Nouns.**\n\n**• The request for this support covers compensation for the next four months of the team and legal processes and the construction of the ideation and detailing of the designer's capsule/collection.**\n\n**• There is no physical delivery of this support.**\n\n**• Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace project team.**\n\n**• The importance of this collaboration for Nouns is absolute, where you have a conversation between two audiences, one of which is global.**\n\n**• The specific amount of mass production of capsule items is still under study and will be detailed in the second support raised for the second phase.**\n\n\n# **Team:**\n\n[Synthetic](https://twitter.com/synthetic_eth) **: project dedicated to the creation and transmission connections.

All the while, a fat lad on a Midlands housing estate is looking great and feeling even greater in Palace while waiting for his Chinese takeaway and playing Fortnite.\n\n## Strength in Numbers\n\nThe large take on several already-created collaborations and communication from other brands to the nft audience is an excellent entry point for the brand to reach fans and a new market. Likewise, for the Nouns community;  **significant increases in brand awareness, favorability for further collaborations, and open public interest in the brand, consequently becomes a win-win.** To highlight the ROI of the collaboration, let's look at promoting the Palace brand among your collaborations;\n\n[Gucci](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjsKDzipOtF), [Mercedes](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CbXyjVPq0VI), [New Balance](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cr-s3WotGz1), [Adidas](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoHewHju2Ii), [RIMOWA](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoUlcMeqvAs), and many others.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/qCpbrcS.jpg)\n[PALACE JAPAN MAGAZINE](https://www.palaceskateboards.com/range/spring-2019/palace-japan-magazine/)\n\n**Approach**: Use public communication-powered resources to compare social media posts containing mentions of the Palace and Nouns brand, before and after the partnership.\n\"Outcome: Insight into the Marketing ROI of an NFT Dive from Palace\" **“ Significantly increases the reach of Nouns by talking to two sets of customers instead of one and gives a signal from one brand that the other brand is trusted by the upscale market.”**\n\n## Breakdown of legal conditions\n\n**Strategy**: Legal terms and already transcribed collaboration construction.\n\n(the terms below will be robustly written to avoid legal inconvenience)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/fPYHHdj.jpg)\n\n• Recreate the look and feel of the Palace collaborative product; designing new products for that collaboration; concentrated on multiple tacit marketing and management ideas that they share.\n\n• Synthetic and the built committee will be responsible for co-managing the community outreach and communication campaign during construction.\n\n• Creative control, both teams have to work within the decided parameters and cannot go beyond that and after each step, they must report to the other brand.\n\n• Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace team's design and construction team. (This is due to several cordial agreements that the brand already has with the media – Vogue, WWD, Hypebeast and others.)\n\n• Nouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\n• Building a capsule\nA capsule collection is essentially a condensed version of a designer's vision/collaboration, often in limited edition, that transcends seasons and trends by being functional. Thus, focusing on building and delivering key looks, without the style and theatricality of a fashion show.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/5qLsHLr.jpg)\n\n**Nouns Palace will be a 5-item capsule.**\n\n**Important: The data below is for a better visualization of what will be built in the second phase. The numbers are base numbers, discussed in the first meetings, therefore they are changeable.**\n\nThe total supply of the collection will be approximately ~6000 pieces, divided between three distinct pieces of clothing, palace noogles, and skate decks.\n\n• clothing number 1 \n• clothing number 2\n• clothing number 3 \n\n• Noggles Palace =\n\n• Deck 1\n• Deck 2\n\n**a % (percentage) of collection sales will be directed to the NounsDAO Treasury.**\n\n## Transparency and Confidential Terms\n\nDetailed legal processes and collaboration building over the next four months;\n\n• Recitals\n• Purpose\n• Confidentiality Clause\n• Commercial Clause\n• Investment Clause\n• Duties and Obligations of Collaborators\n• Reporting and Project Management\n• Intellectual Property Rights\n\n• Fashion product mix;\n• Creation and style;\n• Prototyping;\n• Product development;\n• Marketing and Sales Strategy;\n• Collection management;\n• Evaluation of results.\n\n## Building in public\n\n**There is no precedent for similar proposals in Nouns**, a collaboration like this creates demand for interaction and content that can be used by other builders and future collaborations.\n\nMany of the processes built to reach an agreement with a corporate are extremely tiring and even building their direction and a good presentation, most corporations prioritize closed and legal agreements to add clauses and prioritize their Intellectual Property.\n\n• Create a [general structure](https://mirror.xyz/0x905Ca7a9479EA1B9a8CDeD74da98e3CC5E6E2949) together with lawyer consulting to detail the collaboration and develop material to serve as a reference for other builders.\n\n**Accountability**\n\nForm a Steering Committee: composed of [DeGenData](https://twitter.com/degendata), [Ccarella](https://twitter.com/ccarella), [Oni-apenoun](https://twitter.com/apenoun) and 1 other noun who have intimate knowledge of the brands present in the collaboration.\n\nProvide this committee with **frequent updates on clauses, legal terms, construction and execution of the collaboration.**\n\n# **What has been done so far?**\n\nThe Synthetic project is somewhat similar to Nouns both are test projects so the constant change is geared towards further research and longer-term construction.\n\nOpen round 15\nOpen round 16\nOpen round 18\nHack Week IRL\nInfinite Rounds\n \n  \n![](https://imgur.com/aQHXdNh.jpg) \n  \n# **FAQ**\n\n• Will there be any activation exclusively for noun holders?\n\nYes, one of the reasons for building a capsule is that it is more malleable to community based implementations.\n\n• Will the capsule be made available globally?\n\nYes, with the exception of one item that will be available exclusively in certain regions.\n\n• Will sales also be available in physical stores?\n\nNouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n• Does this proposal cover actually creating the capsule? So the end result is ultimately Palace x Nouns clothes I can buy online?\n\nThis proposal covers the consolidation of legal terms, as well as the construction of the idealization/concept for creating the capsule. The construction with already defined direction and execution of the capsule will start in phase two (second support).\n\n## Funding Request\n\nOperations & Admin Compensation - 1 Noun + €9.700\n\n• 1 Noun for Synthetic (the noun requested by the synthetic would be as compensation for the next few months that will be worked before the MFG.)\n\nWe have already been funded several times by the DAO, we consider long-term construction more interesting, and several subcommunities are eager for more ideas from us, so holding the voting power that was our initial objective for greater participation is excellent.\n\n€9.700 for construction already undertaken to enable feasible collaboration.\n\n• 1 Noun for Palace. Many Nouners have  interested in Palace owning a Noun and participating in Governance. They would be interested in giving one of the Treasury Nouns. Sending a Noun to Palace will be done with a follow-up proposal.\n\n**Total =**\n• 1 Noun + €9.700 for Synthetic transaction\n• 1 Noun for Palace direct transaction \n\n# **Conclusion**\n    \n• A collaboration is being established between Palace and Nouns.\n\n• The request for this support covers compensation for the next four months of the team and legal processes and the construction of the ideation and detailing of the designer's capsule/collection.\n\n• There is no physical delivery of this support.\n\n• Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace project team.\n\n• The importance of this collaboration for Nouns is absolute, where you have a conversation between two audiences, one of which is global.\n\n• The specific amount of mass production of capsule items is still under study and will be detailed in the second support raised for the second phase.\n\n\n# **Team:**\n\n[Synthetic](https://twitter.com/synthetic_eth): project dedicated to the creation and transmission connections. Through this model, Synthetic has already contributed to five projects for the Nouns.\n\n**Considering the inopportune timing and where much of the attention is being directed towards the fork. This proposal has been restudied and rewritten a few times in the last week with feedback from the community and the committee itself considering the current market.**\n\n**Questions or comments?

Nouns NFTs, art, and projects are not just showcased but become part of the experience itself, creating a unique setting that blurs the line between onchain and offchain.\n\nOur goal is to create a highly curated, customisable, Nouns-themed venue open to all. The villa will reflect the Nouns values and ethos in the real world, while meeting the growing demand for immersive experiences inside and outside of the Nouns community. We also aim to reach a level of quality and originality in order to be potentially included in Airbnb’s top picks, giving further exposure to the Villa and Nouns outside web3.\n\n**Key features**\n\n- **Booking**: Book your stay on Airbnb, or onchain from villanouns.wtf.\n- **Access**: Use your wallet to unlock the door, and share access with others onchain. No physical keys needed.\n- **Explore**: Walk around the villa to discover and interact with the Nouns universe.\n- **Buy**: Like an art piece or item at the villa? Buy it right there with your Ethereum wallet.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nWe plan to complete all work in 12 to 24 weeks and start welcoming guests by 2024.\n\n**Team**\n\n- **Management**: Led by the villa owner, an experienced property developer.\n- **Development**: Carried out by dlabs, known for working on projects like Nouns Agora, Optimism, Slice and Juicebox.\n- **Design and art**: Made by skilled architects, designers and artists.\n- **Community**: The entire Nouns community will be involved in the project, including groups like Gnars, ComicsDAO and SharkDAO.\n\n**Funding request**\n\nWe request 153 ETH to redesign and refurnish the villa with nounish custom-made items, build the experience, as well as take all necessary measures to offer the best possible experience to guests.\n\n**Future plans**\n\nWe're looking beyond just one Villa. Here's how we'll grow while doing good:\n\n - **More villas, more stories**: we plan to open more villas locally and around the world, especially in places rich in art and culture. It’s not just about expanding — it's about building a global community that shares the Nouns spirit.\n- **Franchise model as a public good**: To maximise scalability, we’ll invite more property owners to become part of Villa Nouns, without charging any fees. We'll make sure every place meets our high standards to offer the best to guests, through mandatory assessments from our team.\n- **Activities for everyone**: We’ll offer a range of activities to enhance the guest experience further. Think pools, sports areas, dining spots, and curated outdoor adventures for kids and adults.\n- **Nouns at your home**: In collaboration with artists and designers, we’ll craft a line of home goods inspired by Nouns. They'll first appear at Villa Nouns and then will be available for everyone to buy online and onchain, helping to proliferate the Nouns vibe far and wide.\n\n![2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fy280LtN/2.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## The nounish experience\n\n![Villa_Nouns_Gate.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/m2Zxzzn0/Villa-Nouns-Gate.jpg)\n\nReferences to many past and future Nouns projects will be integrated with the interiors of the villa and the surrounding natural environment. \n\nGuests will be able to read the Nouns comic, ride Gnars skateboards or surfboards, watch the Nouns movie, learn the history of Nouns, and more. Furthermore, holders of Nouns and derivatives will enjoy an even more personalised experience, customising screens and interiors of the villa based on their NFT holdings.\n\nCertain areas of the house like the bedrooms will be themed on specific Nouns or derivative collections. The overall experience will also evolve over time due to feedback and new projects in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nMost items at the villa will be Nouns themed, like towels, cutlery and home accessories, and some will also be gifted to guests. Among the nounish objects, furniture and decorations, we also plan to build suggestive stone mosaics and murals made by artists in the Nouns community. \n\n![_final.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/TPDBMryW/final.gif)\n\n**Booking and entering the villa**\n\n![main.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/cHc90Td6/main.jpg)\n\nGuests will be able to book the villa on Airbnb, or directly onchain through a custom booking website on [villanouns.wtf](http://villanouns.wtf).\n\nThe villa can be accessed by connecting the wallet on-site and verifying the purchase.

We’d be honored to enlist your support and advocacy, both as a Nouns brand and as a collection of highly sensible and web3 native individuals. \n\n# ERC-6551 Integration + Enhancement\n\nFrom ERC-6551's [whitepaper](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551#abstract):\n\nERC-6551 Abstract: “This proposal defines a system which assigns Ethereum accounts to all non-fungible tokens. These token bound accounts allow NFTs to own assets and interact with applications, without requiring changes to existing smart contracts or infrastructure.”\n\nAnother quote: \"Each token bound account is owned by a single ERC-721 token, allowing the token to interact with the blockchain, record transaction history, and own on-chain assets. Control of each token bound account is delegated to the owner of the ERC-721 token, allowing the owner to initiate on-chain actions on behalf of their token.\"\n\nIf ERC-721s (NFTs) are to be so active, they must be simply and uniquely identifiable.\n\nENS, fundamentally, provides this service to Ethereum wallets.\n\nNFTR, natively, provides this service to NFTs and ERC-6551 Users.\n\nAs ENS provides limitless value and utility beyond reach/reference, so does NFTR. \n\n# NFT Name Integration\n\nNFTR Names can be easily integrated by ABI/API call into:\n* Existing NFT Marketplaces (show names below NFTs for sale)\n* Metaverse spaces\n* Web3 Games\n* Social media apps that display verified NFTs\n\nIntegrated NFTR Names are:\n\n* Quickly reachable by web domain at [name].nftr.name\n* Clickable, directing to NFTR Profile for direct interaction with the NFT\n* Interactive via NFT Messaging, direct payments, bidding, browsing NFT history, etc.\n\n# How Does NFTR’s namespace work?\n\nNFT Names are registered in NFTR’s [Registry Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc662a8ce36392d4b9489d0b59605a1874711bfc6). They are unique, meaning that no two NFTs can simultaneously hold the same name. They are NOT tokens or NFTs themselves. This brings the following benefits:\n* NFTR Name transactions are light (not gas intensive)\n* NFT Names are bound to the NFT, and travel with the NFT\nNFTR’s native name marketplace facilitates free in-wallet name transfer and buying/selling/bidding between wallets. Names are integrated into existing dApps via API/ABI call.\n\nNames are alphanumeric strings with no leading or trailing spaces, and are case sensitive for display purposes. But case-insensitive for duplicity purposes.\n\n\n# Similar Props\n\n**107 Verse**: Narrowly passed before funds were returned. Conflicted results due to purchase of equity in a non-Nouns project (Verse). Relation to our prop: NFTR is requesting DAO funds, not selling equity. NFTR is Nounish in DAO structure, and will feature ⌐◧-◧ in daily NFTs. \n\n**189 SharkDAO**: “I see these types of proposals as \"cultural venture investments\", similar to our @nounsbuilder funding… we just need to know whether a) we trust that the subDAO will steward those funds in a way that is positive for Nouns DAO, and b) if the cumulative ask is an amount of our treasury we are comfortable \"locking up\" until we see the cultural ROI from that spending.” Relation to our prop: NFTR can be viewed as a venture investment, though all funds will be incrementally added to the NFTR DAO, and their usage will be determined by DAO members (20% NFTR team, 10% NounsDAO). As a contributing member of Nouns and an innovator in the space, it can be reasonably assumed that DigitalOil will be an admirable steward of NFTR and its association to the Nouns brand and DAO model. \n\n**284: PizzaDAO**: Executed prop to fund PizzaDAO’s global pizza party, featuring Nouns branding and Noggle props. Here, Nouns served as sponsor for another DAO’s mission while perpetuating the Nouns meme.

Everyday Ed B faces a new challenge – having to fight off racists at Trader Joes while perusing the vegan aisle, or running butt ass naked for a couple of dollars to pay his rent, OR having to sell photos of himself on the internet to help fund his next record – BUT they never stop him from pushing towards his dream of becoming the Beyoncé of puppets.\n\n## FORMAT\n\n* 10-12 minute web(3)isode\n* Stop motion and mixed media animation.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/aah6X7X.jpg)\n# Pilot Episode\n\n## SYNOPSIS\n\n“A Song About Black Love” - Infatuated by a blossoming love interest, Ed B works out a new song about the joys of Black love. Billy, Ed’s bandmate, roommate and white ally, questions a hidden secret within Ed’s relationship and mayhem ensues.\n\n## FUNDING\n\n“A Song About Black Love” was self funded by Ed Balloon in 2022 primarily through the sale of NFTs. The tentpole fundraising project was the Run Ed Collection, a first-of-its-kind generative sound and motion NFT project that blended stop-motion, 2D and 3D animation, and music. Ed Balloon dropped the 1000 piece collection and it sold out, kickstarting production of the pilot. To help uplift other artists, Ed Balloon pledged 50 percent of the collection’s secondary sales toward The Ed Balloon Generational Wealth Fund, which collects work from Black and other under-represented artists in Web3.\n\n## CAST\n\n**Ed B “The Puppet”** | Ed Balloon\n**Billy** | Seth Green (Robot Chicken, Family Guy)\n**Peggy** | Blair Socci (Comedian)\n**Savannah** | Destiny Lavigne\n___\n# Nouns Integration in New Episodes\n\nThe possibilities for Nouns integration within the Ed B The Puppet universe are infinite. Noggles can be introduced as unique accessories that Ed and Billy can interact with, enabling them to solve problems or embark on new adventures. Noun characters could even make an appearance, bringing a sense of curiosity, wonder, or even magical qualities to the narrative.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/Rw9HCbF.jpg)\n# Project Objective\n\n## Amplify Diversity\n\nBy creating content that celebrates and embraces diversity, we can showcase a wide array of perspectives and experiences. The Ed B ‘The Puppet’ Show will feature characters from different backgrounds, challenging stereotypes and fostering empathy among audiences. Through collaboration with the Nouns, we aim to elevate the visibility of diverse voices and promote a more inclusive entertainment landscape.\n\n## Utilize Satire for Social Commentary\n\nSatire serves as a powerful tool for social commentary, allowing us to address pertinent societal issues in a thought-provoking and engaging manner. By employing satire, we can challenge the status quo, stimulate critical thinking, and spark conversations that lead to positive change. Our collaboration with the Nouns will provide a platform for satirical content that encourages viewers to question and reconsider established norms.\n\n## Promote Collaboration and Solidarity\n\nOur project embraces the spirit of collaboration within the web3 community. By partnering with the Nouns, we aim to showcase the power of collaboration in amplifying diverse voices and driving innovation. Through cross-platform promotions, joint marketing initiatives, and immersive fan experiences, we can create a unified front that promotes solidarity within the industry. We will be using noun features (Noggles, characters, etc) in these episodes.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/LGpjxXz.jpg)\n# Creative Team\n\n## Ed Balloon [Series Creator & Creative Director]\n\nSpearheading cultural representation and identity through his music and digital art, Ed Balloon has solidified himself not only as a Web3 artist and musician but also as a community leader.  Known for his innovative approach to music making, dynamic production style, and unique blend of electronic, hip-hop, and R&B, his 2022 Run Ed collection was presented as a one-of-a-kind generative sound and motion endeavor that blended stop-motion, 2D and 3D animation, and music. To help uplift other artists, 50 percent of the collection’s secondary sales continued to go toward The Ed Balloon Generational Wealth Fund, which collects work from Black and other under-represented artists in Web3. The pioneering musician also recently self-funded through the sale of NFTs the stop motion animated satire \"A SONG ABOUT BLACK LOVE.”  Executive produced by Daveed Diggs and starring Ed alongside actor Seth Green, the film showcases the difficulties of finding love as a black puppet.  Ed was also recently nominated to nftnow's NFT100, a celebration of the top 100 influential creators and community leaders in the NFT space.\n\nTwitter: @Ed_Balloon\n\n## Daveed Diggs [Executive Producer]\n* Vocalist in experimental hip hop group Clipping.\n* Co-star in The Little Mermaid, Hamilton, Snowpiercer, Wonder, Velvet Buzzsaw\n* Writer and Producer of Blindspotting\n* Tony and Grammy Winner.

Villa Nouns aims to be the ultimate destination for Nouns fans and newcomers alike, a place that blurs the line between onchain and offchain.\n\nMore than a place to stay, our goal is to create a highly curated, customisable, Nouns-themed venue open to all. By encouraging innovation, art, education and fun experiences, Villa Nouns will reflect the Nouns values and ethos in the real world, while meeting the growing demand for immersive experiences inside and outside of the Nouns community. \n\n**How it works**\n\n- **Book** your stay on Airbnb, or onchain from villanouns.wtf.\n- **Access** the villa with your wallet, and share access with others onchain. No physical keys needed.\n- **Explore** the spaces to discover and interact with the Nouns universe.\n- **Buy** nounish furniture, items or NFTs directly at the villa, with your Ethereum wallet.\n\nRevenue generated from bookings and sales of nounish items will be channeled back into the Nouns treasury, as well as shared with partnering communities and Nouns owners.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nWe plan to complete all work in 12 to 24 weeks and start welcoming guests by 2024.\n\n**Team**\n\n- **Management**: Led by the villa owner, an experienced property developer.\n- **Development**: Carried out by dlabs, known for working on projects like Nouns Agora, Optimism, Slice and Juicebox.\n- **Design and art**: Made by skilled architects, designers and artists.\n- **Community**: The entire Nouns community will be involved in the project, including groups like Gnars, ComicsDAO and SharkDAO.\n\n**Funding request**\n\nWe request 153 ETH to redesign and refurnish the villa with nounish custom-made items, build the experience, as well as take all necessary measures to offer the best possible experience to guests.\n\n**Future plans**\n\nWe're looking beyond just one villa. Here's how we'll grow while doing good:\n\n- **Builders retreats**: Multiple times a year, we’ll periodically host artists, hackers, and creators to brainstorm and build on nounish ideas. Villa Nouns will be temporarily turned into a hub sparking innovative projects and fostering connections in the Nouns ecosystem.\n- **More spaces, more stories**: We plan to open more properties locally and around the world, especially in places rich in art and culture. It’s not just about expanding — it's about building a global community that shares the Nouns spirit.\n- **Franchise model as a public good**: Keeping in line with the CC0 spirit, we’ll be opening doors for property owners to become part of Villa Nouns, while ensuring quality through a rigorous review by our team.\n- **Activities for everyone**: We’ll offer a range of activities to enhance the guest experience further. Think pools, sports areas, dining spots, and curated outdoor adventures for kids and adults.\n- **Nouns at your home**: In collaboration with artists and designers, we’ll craft a line of home goods inspired by Nouns. They'll first appear at Villa Nouns and then will be available for everyone to buy online and onchain, helping to proliferate the Nouns vibe far and wide.\n\n![2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fy280LtN/2.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## The nounish experience\n\n![Villa_Nouns_Gate.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/m2Zxzzn0/Villa-Nouns-Gate.jpg)\n\nReferences to many past and future Nouns projects will be integrated with the interiors of the villa and the surrounding natural environment. \n\nGuests will be able to read the Nouns comic, ride Gnars skateboards or surfboards, watch the Nouns movie, learn the history of Nouns, and more. Furthermore, holders of Nouns and derivatives will enjoy an even more personalised experience, customising screens and interiors of the villa based on their NFT holdings.\n\nCertain areas of the house like the bedrooms will be themed on specific Nouns or derivative collections. The overall experience will also evolve over time due to feedback and new projects in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nMost items at the villa will be Nouns themed, like towels, cutlery and home accessories, and some will also be gifted to guests. Among the nounish objects, furniture and decorations, we also plan to build suggestive stone mosaics and murals made by artists in the Nouns community. \n\n![_final.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/TPDBMryW/final.gif)\n\n**Booking and entering the villa**\n\n![main.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/cHc90Td6/main.jpg)\n\nGuests will be able to book the villa on Airbnb, or directly onchain through a custom booking website on [villanouns.wtf](http://villanouns.wtf).\n\nThe villa can be accessed by connecting the wallet on-site and verifying the purchase.

There is no physical delivery on this support.\n\n## **Concept**\n\nA defining underground force in menswear in the 2010s, Palace here echoes the new and weirdness of Nouns through a series of pieces that will hybridize their creative universes – inherently Italian, boldly new, translated anew. The initial inspiration will be built on the Palace catalog itself and on the undeniable influence of Nouns on nft culture.\n\n## **Introduction**\n\n[Palace Skateboards](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) needs little introduction, but for the uninitiated, the London-based skateboarding and clothing brand has become a mainstay in the streetwear scene for incorporating 1990s and pop culture influences with their VHS-style clothing ads. In other words, it’s kitsch, cool, and everything in between.\n\n# **Why Palace?**\n\n[Palace](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) began as a brand for skateboarders. It is now a brand for all. Models turn up for castings in Palace. Working class Glasgow dads sport Palace. Jay-Z wears Palace. So does Rihanna. Teenage girls sleep in Palace, dreaming of the heart-throbs they’ve seen wearing Palace online. 2018’s Wimbledon finalists played on court in Palace. Soundcloud rappers adore Palace. The ICA exhibits Palace. Serious DJs with peerless techno collections adorn their record boxes with Palace stickers. Ravers ingest ecstasy pills produced in the shape of Palace’s Tri-Ferg logo. Socio-political causes, including the plights of both Jeremy Corbyn and the people of Palestine, have been smartly memed in versions of the Palace triangle.\n\nA middle-aged architect can slyly intimate he has better kids than his colleagues by picking something up at Palace, even if it’s just their socks. Virgil Abloh and Marc Jacobs wear Palace. London tube station walls are adorned by carriage-length adverts for Palace. The bigwigs at Ralph Lauren were so taken by the irrepressible rise of Palace that Palace became its first ever collaborator in 50 years of singularly myth-making fashion history.\n![](https://imgur.com/dlwqvv6.gif)\n![](https://imgur.com/OEHdbcQ.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/KsVOGlC.gif)\nFashion’s favourite photographers Alasdair McLellan, Juergen Teller and David Sims shoot for Palace. Silicon Valley is full of people in Palace. Blue-chip stylists buy Palace from their own pocket money to lend their imagery some of the company’s off-rail styles and indigenous London magic. i-D and British Vogue carry Palace ads. Madonna and child (Rocco) have been photographed proudly wearing Palace. All the while, a fat lad on a Midlands housing estate is looking great and feeling even greater in Palace while waiting for his Chinese takeaway and playing Fortnite.\n\n## Strength in Numbers\n\nThe large take on several already-created collaborations and communication from other brands to the nft audience is an excellent entry point for the brand to reach fans and a new market. Likewise, for the Nouns community;  **significant increases in brand awareness, favorability for further collaborations, and open public interest in the brand, consequently becomes a win-win.** To highlight the ROI of the collaboration, let's look at promoting the Palace brand among your collaborations;\n\n[Gucci](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjsKDzipOtF), [Mercedes](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CbXyjVPq0VI), [New Balance](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cr-s3WotGz1), [Adidas](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoHewHju2Ii), [RIMOWA](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoUlcMeqvAs), and many others.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/qCpbrcS.jpg)\n[PALACE JAPAN MAGAZINE](https://www.palaceskateboards.com/range/spring-2019/palace-japan-magazine/)\n\n**Approach**: Use public communication-powered resources to compare social media posts containing mentions of the Palace and Nouns brand, before and after the partnership.\n\"Outcome: Insight into the Marketing ROI of an NFT Dive from Palace\" **“ Significantly increases the reach of Nouns by talking to two sets of customers instead of one and gives a signal from one brand that the other brand is trusted by the upscale market.”**\n\n# **Phase One and Phase Two.**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/liP7MrS.jpg)\n\nDetailed legal processes and collaboration building over the next four months; **Phase one**\n\n• Recitals\n• Purpose\n• Confidentiality Clause\n• Commercial Clause\n• Investment Clause\n• Duties and Obligations of Collaborators\n• Reporting and Project Management\n• Intellectual Property Rights\n\n• Fashion product mix;\n• Creation and style;\n• Prototyping;\n• Product development;\n• Marketing and Sales Strategy;\n• Collection management;\n• Evaluation of results.\n\n• Why the clauses? What legal work is being done?\n\nThe legal agreements are being directed to our team, much of the brand collection construction has its own construction directions, numbers are collected and none of this can be disclosed, these agreements are for the preservation of the Palace during construction. They have their clients and communities to build collection launches, so the agreements are for communication preservation.\n\nSynthetic is a mediator, and nouns have a proactive CC0 license, In short Palace would not need Synthetic for commercial construction, what we are doing is raising ideas and presenting about the Nouns ecosystem: the various subgroups, the vibe, and the importance.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/ObE6wW9.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/sC8GwqP.jpg)\n\n## Breakdown of legal conditions\n\n**Strategy**: Legal terms and already transcribed collaboration construction.\n\n(the terms below will be robustly written to avoid legal inconvenience)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/fPYHHdj.jpg)\n\n• Recreate the look and feel of the Palace collaborative product; designing new products for that collaboration; concentrated on multiple tacit marketing and management ideas that they share.\n\n• Synthetic and the built committee will be responsible for co-managing the community outreach and communication campaign during construction.\n\n• Creative control, both teams have to work within the decided parameters and cannot go beyond that and after each step, they must report to the other brand.\n\n• Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace team's design and construction team. (This is due to several cordial agreements that the brand already has with the media – Vogue, WWD, Hypebeast and others.)\n\n• Nouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n# **Palace Nouns: What to expect**\n\nThe special line is a connection to the “new” and will feature easter eggs throughout to make each piece truly special. The icing on the cake? Palace will launch women's ready-to-wear designs, making this collaboration one for all genders. The build will be designed to be a capsule of 5 distinct items. Because both aesthetics have been merged, expect logos to do the same.\n\nOn Palace’s classics – we're talking tracksuits, jeans, football shirts, skate decks – you'll see the Nouns identity scattered throughout. You’ll see this synergy on other more luxurious pieces, like a shearling jacket, as well as other unusual collectibles.\n\nAnother surprise for collectors is noggles Palace – a witty homage to the ‘weird’ collection, if you will. The idea came up and its design is about to be created as a double brand, wrapped in the Palace Nouns monogram.\n\n## Palace Nouns: What will be delivered with the execution of phases two and one\n\nEntitled “Palace Nouns,” the capsule – comprises statement-making garments designed for the collaboration. Jackets, noogles palace, vests, and skateboard decks are some of the pieces that are designed to be present, all adorning the new graphics, intertwined with the unmistakable details of Palace and Nouns.\n\nGlobal communication, Palace maintains a standardization of communication between its clients to build and launch a new collaboration; In their coverage, many media outlets go into significant detail about their collaborations and make them public globally.\n\n• Looking ahead: Building a capsule\n\nA capsule collection is essentially a condensed version of a designer's vision/collaboration, often in limited edition, that transcends seasons and trends by being functional. Thus, focusing on building and delivering key looks, without the style and theatricality of a fashion show.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/5qLsHLr.jpg)\n\n**Nouns Palace will be a 5-item capsule.**\n\n**a % (percentage) of collection sales will be directed to the NounsDAO Treasury.**\n\n## Building in public\n\n**There is no precedent for similar proposals in Nouns**, a collaboration like this creates demand for interaction and content that can be used by other builders and future collaborations.\n\nMany of the processes built to reach an agreement with a corporate are extremely tiring and even building their direction and a good presentation, most corporations prioritize closed and legal agreements to add clauses and prioritize their Intellectual Property.\n\n• Create a [general structure](https://mirror.xyz/0x905Ca7a9479EA1B9a8CDeD74da98e3CC5E6E2949) together with lawyer consulting to detail the collaboration and develop material to serve as a reference for other builders.\n\n• Unfortunately, the fashion collaborations have had terrible results in Nouns. What makes this different?\n\nYes, we are aware that we have seen several proposals without any results, this creates a history for the community to reject future approaches in the same segment, but the work we are building is extremely detailed to avoid any interruption or lack of communication. Open and detailed communication framework, creation of the capsule aimed at the general public and construction of an official approach.\n\nCollaboration is the combination of numbers and audience as well as the introduction to a new group of clients. **When we mention that there are no precedents built for Nouns, we reaffirm.**\n\n**Accountability**\n\nForm a Steering Committee: composed of [DeGenData](https://twitter.com/degendata), [Ccarella](https://twitter.com/ccarella), [Oni-apenoun](https://twitter.com/apenoun) and 1 other noun who have intimate knowledge of the brands present in the collaboration.\n\nProvide this committee with **frequent updates on clauses, legal terms, construction and execution of the collaboration.**\n\n[Supriyo](https://twitter.com/next_roy) and [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi) also made themselves available to help us by monitoring the execution of the collaboration framework and giving us closer feedback.\n\n# **What has been done so far?**\n\nWhat has been done so far?\n\nThe Synthetic project is somewhat similar to Nouns, they are both test projects, so the constant change is aimed at future research and long-term construction.\n\nSome of our achievements and experiments during this period;\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/fYjLkWZ.jpg)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/YbbKqSa.jpg)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/QXeZfjv.jpg)\n\nIn several of our experiments with DAO we had constructions just for the meme without considering the funding request.\n\nA document is being built on the mirror detailing our experiments and will be available on our [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/synthetic_eth)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/aQHXdNh.jpg)\n\n# **FAQ**\n\n• Will there be any activation exclusively for noun holders?\n\nYes, one of the reasons for building a capsule is that it is more malleable to community based implementations.\n\n• Will the capsule be made available globally?\n\nYes, with the exception of one item that will be available exclusively in certain regions.\n\n• Will sales also be available in physical stores?\n\nNouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n• Does this proposal cover actually creating the capsule? So the end result is ultimately Palace x Nouns clothes I can buy online?\n\nThis proposal covers the consolidation of legal terms, as well as the construction of the idealization/concept for creating the capsule.

There is no physical delivery on this support.\n\n## **Concept**\n\nA defining underground force in menswear in the 2010s, Palace here echoes the new and weirdness of Nouns through a series of pieces that will hybridize their creative universes – inherently Italian, boldly new, translated anew. The initial inspiration will be built on the Palace catalog itself and on the undeniable influence of Nouns on nft culture.\n\n## **Introduction**\n\n[Palace Skateboards](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) needs little introduction, but for the uninitiated, the London-based skateboarding and clothing brand has become a mainstay in the streetwear scene for incorporating 1990s and pop culture influences with their VHS-style clothing ads. In other words, it’s kitsch, cool, and everything in between.\n\n# **Why Palace?**\n\n[Palace](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) began as a brand for skateboarders. It is now a brand for all. Models turn up for castings in Palace. Working class Glasgow dads sport Palace. Jay-Z wears Palace. So does Rihanna. Teenage girls sleep in Palace, dreaming of the heart-throbs they’ve seen wearing Palace online. 2018’s Wimbledon finalists played on court in Palace. Soundcloud rappers adore Palace. The ICA exhibits Palace. Serious DJs with peerless techno collections adorn their record boxes with Palace stickers. Ravers ingest ecstasy pills produced in the shape of Palace’s Tri-Ferg logo. Socio-political causes, including the plights of both Jeremy Corbyn and the people of Palestine, have been smartly memed in versions of the Palace triangle.\n\nA middle-aged architect can slyly intimate he has better kids than his colleagues by picking something up at Palace, even if it’s just their socks. Virgil Abloh and Marc Jacobs wear Palace. London tube station walls are adorned by carriage-length adverts for Palace. The bigwigs at Ralph Lauren were so taken by the irrepressible rise of Palace that Palace became its first ever collaborator in 50 years of singularly myth-making fashion history.\n![](https://imgur.com/dlwqvv6.gif)\n![](https://imgur.com/OEHdbcQ.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/KsVOGlC.gif)\nFashion’s favourite photographers Alasdair McLellan, Juergen Teller and David Sims shoot for Palace. Silicon Valley is full of people in Palace. Blue-chip stylists buy Palace from their own pocket money to lend their imagery some of the company’s off-rail styles and indigenous London magic. i-D and British Vogue carry Palace ads. Madonna and child (Rocco) have been photographed proudly wearing Palace. All the while, a fat lad on a Midlands housing estate is looking great and feeling even greater in Palace while waiting for his Chinese takeaway and playing Fortnite.\n\n## Strength in Numbers\n\nThe large take on several already-created collaborations and communication from other brands to the nft audience is an excellent entry point for the brand to reach fans and a new market. Likewise, for the Nouns community;  **significant increases in brand awareness, favorability for further collaborations, and open public interest in the brand, consequently becomes a win-win.** To highlight the ROI of the collaboration, let's look at promoting the Palace brand among your collaborations;\n\n[Gucci](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjsKDzipOtF), [Mercedes](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CbXyjVPq0VI), [New Balance](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cr-s3WotGz1), [Adidas](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoHewHju2Ii), [RIMOWA](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoUlcMeqvAs), and many others.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/qCpbrcS.jpg)\n[PALACE JAPAN MAGAZINE](https://www.palaceskateboards.com/range/spring-2019/palace-japan-magazine/)\n\n**Approach**: Use public communication-powered resources to compare social media posts containing mentions of the Palace and Nouns brand, before and after the partnership.\n\"Outcome: Insight into the Marketing ROI of an NFT Dive from Palace\" **“ Significantly increases the reach of Nouns by talking to two sets of customers instead of one and gives a signal from one brand that the other brand is trusted by the upscale market.”**\n\n# **Phase One and Phase Two.**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/liP7MrS.jpg)\n\nDetailed legal processes and collaboration building over the next four months; **Phase one**\n\n• Recitals\n• Purpose\n• Confidentiality Clause\n• Commercial Clause\n• Investment Clause\n• Duties and Obligations of Collaborators\n• Reporting and Project Management\n• Intellectual Property Rights\n\n• Fashion product mix;\n• Creation and style;\n• Prototyping;\n• Product development;\n• Marketing and Sales Strategy;\n• Collection management;\n• Evaluation of results.\n\nFor the scope of this proposal, Synthetic team is acting as the liason on behalf of the Nouns community and will adhere to all non-confidentiality & legal agreements relevant to Palace's collaboration workflow. Synthetic will work closely with the Nouns community to share public work-in-progress updates regularly which do not breach the above said agreements.\n\nSynthetic is a mediator, and nouns have a proactive CC0 license, In short Palace would not need Synthetic for commercial construction, what we are doing is raising ideas and presenting about the Nouns ecosystem: the various subgroups, the vibe, and the importance.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/ObE6wW9.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/sC8GwqP.jpg)\n\n## Breakdown of legal conditions\n\n**Strategy**: Legal terms and already transcribed collaboration construction.\n\n(the terms below will be robustly written to avoid legal inconvenience)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/fPYHHdj.jpg)\n\n• Recreate the look and feel of the Palace collaborative product; designing new products for that collaboration; concentrated on multiple tacit marketing and management ideas that they share.\n\n• Synthetic and the built committee will be responsible for co-managing the community outreach and communication campaign during construction.\n\n• Creative control, both teams have to work within the decided parameters and cannot go beyond that and after each step, they must report to the other brand.\n\n• Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace team's design and construction team. (This is due to several cordial agreements that the brand already has with the media – Vogue, WWD, Hypebeast and others.)\n\n• Nouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n# **Palace Nouns: What to expect**\n\nThe special line is a connection to the “new” and will feature easter eggs throughout to make each piece truly special. The icing on the cake? Palace will launch women's ready-to-wear designs, making this collaboration one for all genders. The build will be designed to be a capsule of 5 distinct items. Because both aesthetics have been merged, expect logos to do the same.\n\nOn Palace’s classics – we're talking tracksuits, jeans, football shirts, skate decks – you'll see the Nouns identity scattered throughout. You’ll see this synergy on other more luxurious pieces, like a shearling jacket, as well as other unusual collectibles.\n\nAnother surprise for collectors is noggles Palace – a witty homage to the ‘weird’ collection, if you will. The idea came up and its design is about to be created as a double brand, wrapped in the Palace Nouns monogram.\n\n## Palace Nouns: What will be delivered with the execution of phases two and one\n\nEntitled “Palace Nouns,” the capsule – comprises statement-making garments designed for the collaboration. Jackets, noogles palace, vests, and skateboard decks are some of the pieces that are designed to be present, all adorning the new graphics, intertwined with the unmistakable details of Palace and Nouns.\n\nGlobal communication, Palace maintains a standardization of communication between its clients to build and launch a new collaboration; In their coverage, many media outlets go into significant detail about their collaborations and make them public globally.\n\n• Looking ahead: Building a capsule\n\nA capsule collection is essentially a condensed version of a designer's vision/collaboration, often in limited edition, that transcends seasons and trends by being functional. Thus, focusing on building and delivering key looks, without the style and theatricality of a fashion show.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/5qLsHLr.jpg)\n\n**Nouns Palace will be a 5-item capsule.**\n\n**a % (percentage) of collection sales will be directed to the NounsDAO Treasury.**\n\n## Building in public\n\n**There is no precedent for similar proposals in Nouns**, a collaboration like this creates demand for interaction and content that can be used by other builders and future collaborations.\n\nMany of the processes built to reach an agreement with a corporate are extremely tiring and even building their direction and a good presentation, most corporations prioritize closed and legal agreements to add clauses and prioritize their Intellectual Property.\n\n• Create a [general structure](https://mirror.xyz/0x905Ca7a9479EA1B9a8CDeD74da98e3CC5E6E2949) together with lawyer consulting to detail the collaboration and develop material to serve as a reference for other builders.\n\n• Unfortunately, the fashion collaborations have had terrible results in Nouns. What makes this different?\n\nYes, we are aware that we have seen several proposals without any results, this creates a history for the community to reject future approaches in the same segment, but the work we are building is extremely detailed to avoid any interruption or lack of communication. Open and detailed communication framework, creation of the capsule aimed at the general public and construction of an official approach.\n\nBuilding an official approach aims to contain everything that is expected from collaboration and has never been met;\n\n•Campaign\n•Communication published on the Palace's official social media containing a pre-announcement of the launch date.\n•Sending email newsletters to existing customers, with previews of collaboration lookbooks.\n•Mainstream coverage, Palace is known for the buzz it creates when announcing its collaborations, due to the coverage and attention its clients and media outlets create.\n\nCollaboration is the combination of numbers and audience as well as the introduction to a new group of clients. **When we mention that there are no precedents built for Nouns, we reaffirm.**\n\n**Accountability**\n\nForm a Steering Committee: composed of [DeGenData](https://twitter.com/degendata), [Ccarella](https://twitter.com/ccarella), [Oni-apenoun](https://twitter.com/apenoun) and 1 other noun who have intimate knowledge of the brands present in the collaboration.\n\nProvide this committee with **frequent updates on clauses, legal terms, construction and execution of the collaboration.**\n\n[Supriyo](https://twitter.com/next_roy) and [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi) also made themselves available to help us by monitoring the execution of the collaboration framework and giving us closer feedback.\n\n# **What has been done so far?**\n\nWhat has been done so far?\n\nThe Synthetic project is somewhat similar to Nouns, they are both test projects, so the constant change is aimed at future research and long-term construction.\n\nSome of our achievements and experiments during this period;\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/fYjLkWZ.jpg)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/YbbKqSa.jpg)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/QXeZfjv.jpg)\n\nIn several of our experiments with DAO we had constructions just for the meme without considering the funding request.\n\nA document is being built on the mirror detailing our experiments and will be available on our [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/synthetic_eth)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/aQHXdNh.jpg)\n\n# **FAQ**\n\n• Will there be any activation exclusively for noun holders?\n\nYes, In short - we will be designing the capsule with a variety of nouns specific perks in mind. Details will be defined during the ideation of the capsule.\n\n• Will the capsule be made available globally?\n\nYes, with the exception of one item that will be available exclusively in certain regions.\n\n• Will sales also be available in physical stores?\n\nNouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n• Does this proposal cover actually creating the capsule? So the end result is ultimately Palace x Nouns clothes I can buy online?\n\nThis proposal covers the consolidation of legal terms, as well as the construction of the idealization/concept for creating the capsule. The construction with already defined direction and execution of the capsule will start in phase two (second support).\n\n## Funding Request\n\nOperations & Admin Compensation - €47.000\n\n• Compensation + fees for 4 Months of two full-time synthetic team members. €37.600\n**(€4700 per member/month)**\n\n• Legal expenses - €15400\nLawyer consulting on clauses clauses established by Palace\n\nTotal =\n**€62400**\n\n# **Conclusion**\n    \n• A collaboration is being established between Palace and Nouns.\n\n• The request for this support covers compensation for the next four months of the team and legal processes and the construction of the ideation and detailing of the designer's capsule/collection.\n\n• There is no physical delivery of this support.\n\n• Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace project team.\n\n• The importance of this collaboration for Nouns is absolute, where you have a conversation between two audiences, one of which is global.\n\n• The specific amount of mass production of capsule items is still under study and will be detailed in the second support raised for the second phase.\n\n\n# **Team:**\n\n[Synthetic](https://twitter.com/synthetic_eth): project dedicated to the creation and transmission connections.

In Nounish DAO fashion, 1 daily NFT = 1 vote,  will determine NFTR funding initiatives. In return for the funding, Nouns DAO will receive 10% of the supply in perpetuity. In addition, NFTR will direct 5% of daily auction proceeds to the Nouns DAO treasury up to 80 ETH.\n\nNFTR allows naming any ERC-721 with a globally unique name across all Ethereum.\n\nNFTR DAO will eternally proliferate Nouns as sponsor of the NFT Naming standard. \n\nThe up and coming standard -- [ERC-6551](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551)’s Token-Bound Accounts turn NFTs into active onchain identities that can do anything an EOA / smart contract wallet can do. Active NFTs and their accounts need human-readable names for reference and reach.\n\nThis initiative expands Nouns’ addressable market to **all NFT holders**.\n\n# Who's Behind NFTR?\n\n[DigitalOil](https://x.com/0xdigitaloil) is the founder and CEO of [NFTR](https://nftr.name). Team includes 1 BD lead, COO, 2 more devs, and a designer. Development began in Q3 2021. Before going full-time web3, DigitalOil was an iOS developer, satcom engineer, and logistics business executive. He was behind [Prop 199](https://nouns.wtf/vote/199) and worked on [Private Voting](https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint/3976) (recently won the Nouns Private Voting contest) Research funded by Nouns. DigitalOil also recently founded [The Panama DAO](https://twitter.com/ThePanamaDAO), in the image of Nouns DAO, which was pre-seeded 1 ETH by [Nouns Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round:-12/2166) and subsequently seeded 20 ETH by a [Builder DAO Incubator round](https://prop.house/builder/dao-incubator-round-2).\n\nFor more on DigitalOil’s thoughts about Nouns, please refer to his Nouns Agora statement.\n\nNote that DigitalOil has fronted all NFTR founding expenses (over $400k worth) since inception, ~19 months ago. NFTR has never raised seed funding.\n\n# What is NFTR?\n\nNFTR (NFT Registry) is a universal, permissionless NFT Naming Registry on Ethereum.\n\nNFTR allows naming any ERC721 with a globally unique name across all NFTs.\n\nIt's comparable (albeit different architecturally) to ENS for naming NFTs instead of wallets.\n \nNaming an NFT grants the NFT a NFTR Profile with soon to be integrated ERC-6551 functionality (a new standard for Token Bound Accounts) and extensive utility. \n\nNFTR provides an API so that any platform can pull and display names alongside NFTs.\n\nFor more details on protocol architecture, visit [NFTR.name](https://nftr.name) to view our [Docs](https://docs.nftr.name), try our live dApp, view NFTR Profiles at [name].NFTR.name, or engage on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/frMSHsAvay).\n\n![*Nouns that have been named on NFTR.

Allows for the first time for an NFT to point to a social media identity, inter-relating them both ways.*\n\nIntegration of ERC-6551 features will operate a named NFT’s TBAs (Token-Bound Accounts) and associate them with a subdomain, making the TBA reachable by referring to the subdomain (e.g. banking.DigitalOil.nftr).\n\n![The NFTR Name Marketplace allows for trading NFT names.](https://i.imgur.com/UnUzHIP.png)\n*The NFTR Name Marketplace allows for trading NFT names.*\n\nAs an extension of an NFT's naming history, NFTR will develop the first NFT-event specific indexer. The indexer searches and detects all events related to an NFT, including:\n* Contract provenance\n* Mint date\n* Naming history\n* Wallet to wallet transfers\n* NFT enhancements / metadata changes\n* App specific events, like airdrop claims\n* Uses of the NFT as collateral\n* Using the NFT for some collection-specific utility (e.g. Mutating a BAYC)\n* Staking the NFT for yield\n* All of the above with the intent of making NFTR into the first NFT-centric identity platform, where NFTs become social and are front and center.\n\n# Why involve NounsDAO?\n\nDistributing ownership of the contracts and treasury of an Ethereum-wide primitive to a decentralized DAO is the ultimate proliferation of Nouns: perpetuating the ideal on-chain governance model.\n\nWe view Nouns as the purest instantiation of a DAO and are interested in adopting the Nouns DAO model for control and proliferation of the NFTR protocol.\n\nNFTR has been bootstrapped to date. A funding infusion will accelerate development at a critical time, facilitate NFTR’s first marketing efforts, and permit other initiatives to cement NFTR into its sensible role as a necessary and universally adopted public good. \n\nThe Nouns community is full of individuals concerned with innovation and the welfare of web3. We’d be honored to enlist your support and advocacy, both as a Nouns brand and as a collection of highly sensible and web3 native individuals. \n\n# ERC-6551 Integration + Enhancement\n\nFrom ERC-6551's [whitepaper](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551#abstract):\n\nERC-6551 Abstract: “This proposal defines a system which assigns Ethereum accounts to all non-fungible tokens. These token bound accounts allow NFTs to own assets and interact with applications, without requiring changes to existing smart contracts or infrastructure.”\n\nAnother quote: \"Each token bound account is owned by a single ERC-721 token, allowing the token to interact with the blockchain, record transaction history, and own on-chain assets. Control of each token bound account is delegated to the owner of the ERC-721 token, allowing the owner to initiate on-chain actions on behalf of their token.\"\n\nIf ERC-721s (NFTs) are to be so active, they must be simply and uniquely identifiable.\n\nENS, fundamentally, provides this service to Ethereum wallets.\n\nNFTR, natively, provides this service to NFTs and ERC-6551 Users.\n\nAs ENS provides limitless value and utility beyond reach/reference, so does NFTR. \n\n# NFT Name Integration\n\nNFTR Names can be easily integrated by ABI/API call into:\n* Existing NFT Marketplaces (show names below NFTs for sale)\n* Metaverse spaces\n* Web3 Games\n* Social media apps that display verified NFTs\n\nIntegrated NFTR Names are:\n\n* Quickly reachable by web domain at [name].nftr.name\n* Clickable, directing to NFTR Profile for direct interaction with the NFT\n* Interactive via NFT Messaging, direct payments, bidding, browsing NFT history, etc.\n\n# How Does NFTR’s namespace work?\n\nNFT Names are registered in NFTR’s [Registry Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc662a8ce36392d4b9489d0b59605a1874711bfc6). They are unique, meaning that no two NFTs can simultaneously hold the same name. They are NOT tokens or NFTs themselves. This brings the following benefits:\n* NFTR Name transactions are light (not gas intensive)\n* NFT Names are bound to the NFT, and travel with the NFT\nNFTR’s native name marketplace facilitates free in-wallet name transfer and buying/selling/bidding between wallets. Names are integrated into existing dApps via API/ABI call.\n\nNames are alphanumeric strings with no leading or trailing spaces, and are case sensitive for display purposes. But case-insensitive for duplicity purposes.\n\n\n# Similar Props\n\n**107 Verse**: Narrowly passed before funds were returned. Conflicted results due to purchase of equity in a non-Nouns project (Verse). Relation to our prop: NFTR is requesting DAO funds, not selling equity. NFTR is Nounish in DAO structure, and will feature ⌐◧-◧ in daily NFTs. \n\n**189 SharkDAO**: “I see these types of proposals as \"cultural venture investments\", similar to our @nounsbuilder funding… we just need to know whether a) we trust that the subDAO will steward those funds in a way that is positive for Nouns DAO, and b) if the cumulative ask is an amount of our treasury we are comfortable \"locking up\" until we see the cultural ROI from that spending.” Relation to our prop: NFTR can be viewed as a venture investment, though all funds will be incrementally added to the NFTR DAO, and their usage will be determined by DAO members (20% NFTR team, 10% NounsDAO). As a contributing member of Nouns and an innovator in the space, it can be reasonably assumed that DigitalOil will be an admirable steward of NFTR and its association to the Nouns brand and DAO model. \n\n**284: PizzaDAO**: Executed prop to fund PizzaDAO’s global pizza party, featuring Nouns branding and Noggle props. Here, Nouns served as sponsor for another DAO’s mission while perpetuating the Nouns meme. Relation to our prop: Not only will Nouns’ branding be integrated into NFTR’s NFTs and platform; NFTR’s DAO structure will inherently mimic the ideal web3 standard established by NounsDAO, eternally perpetuating the meme and the model. \n\n# NFTR Revenue Model\n\nMultiple revenue streams that will flow to the NFTR DAO Treasury.\n* Paid Namings (0.01 ETH, one-time lifetime fee, adjustable by the DAO)\n* NFTR Marketplace Revenue (5% fee of name trade value, adjustable by the DAO)\n* Daily Nounish NFT Mints\n* Golden Ticket sale fees ([GTKs are an existing](https://www.nftr.name/#/golden-ticket) NFTR-created ERC-20 that token-gates NFTR’s top 1000 names)\n* Fees from eventual advanced NFTR features (NFT Groups, subdomains, etc.)\n\n# How NFTR will proliferate Nouns\n\n* Finish building a web3 standard in the model of Nouns DAO\n* Nounish governance NFTs\n* Nouns DAO will become a major contributor to the NFTR DAO\n* Nouns DAO maintains a significant influence (10% voting weight) over NFTR DAO props.

We are seeking funding to expand our actions in three complementary strategic directions:\n\n1) New regions 📍\n2) Proper marketing in Brazil 🇧🇷\n3) New product categories 👀\n\n**1) New regions 📍**\n‎ \n![](https://i.imgur.com/4iKllzi.png)\n‎ \nNarcose is already part of a network of regular collaborative breweries, through which it markets its beers in the US and Europe. We will take Public Good Beer to these markets, also integrating them into our onboarding ecosystem and turning them into real Nouns builders.\n\nWe are asking for 4350 USDC for label printing, marketing material, initial beer production (minimum 1500 cans/bottles), and aftermovies/content production FOR EACH of our partners:\n\n**Canil** (Portugal) 🇵🇹 - already committed to 1500 bottles and will launch in October, ahead of various crypto events such as ZKdevsummit, Dune Con, ETH Lisbon, EBS2023, Nearcon and Web Summit, all happening in November.\n\n**Stillwater Brewery** (Seattle) 🇺🇸\n**Against the Grain** (Kentucky) 🇺🇸\n**Wooden Ship** (Minneapolis) 🇺🇸\n**Brewski** (Sweden) 🇸🇪\n**Bierol** (Austria) 🇦🇹\n\nIf breweries exclusively produce the subsidized batch, Nouns' maximum cost per can or bottle, which includes premium beer, label printing, a launch event, and ongoing marketing and sales throughout the batch, is only 2.90 USD. Should the brewery opt for a larger batch, as is the case in Brazil, or produce a second batch independently, this cost significantly decreases.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of the funding goes beyond a single event. It serves as a **catalyst for wider influence and regular integration of Nouns into everyday culture.** This is evident in the growing number of [reviews](https://untappd.com/b/cervejaria-narcose-public-good-ipa/5389905) on the popular Untappd app (over 70 to date), spontaneous shares on social media, adoption by various Gnars-related activities in Brazil, featuring in the Nounish Punk game, and our successful production management in Portugal.\n\n👉 **Accelerating Public Good Beer expansion not only brings legitimacy but also sustains a lasting cultural impact for Nouns.**\n\n**BUDGET: 6x 4350 = 26100 USDC**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jvG8dTb.png)\n‎ \n**2) Proper marketing in Brazil 🇧🇷**\n‎ \nInternational expansion will not be instantaneous, as it demands a free schedule in the industry. In this period, we take advantage of the remaining inventory of over 3000 cans produced. \n\nDespite the success of Phase 1, we believe we haven’t reached the full IRL proliferation potential for such a pioneer project. We had 0.5 ETH for everything (sub-300 cans and a very short-scale marketing activation). Thus, the proposed expansion would bring the deserved impact and tons of resources for further promotion of the Nouniverse.\n\nWe are requesting 4350 USDC per quarter for the next six months to fund the activities below. We commit to at least one IRL event every quarter, but given the rapid growth of the Nouns community in Brazil, we anticipate numerous opportunities to engage with new fans.\n\n- Public Good Beer distribution\n- Marketing materials (shirts, stickers, temporary tattoos, and more)\n- Brand activations\n- Professional media production\n\n**BUDGET: 2x 4350 = 8700 USDC**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5JpkcCz.gif)\n‎\n**3) New product categories 👀**\n‎ \nBeyond beer, we have the opportunity to extend the portfolio to two synergic brands/categories:\n\na) BBQ sauces - for the weekly beer-fueled barbecues we do in Brazil; and\nb) Sunscreen - for our community along 7637 km of coastline, with bikinis, surf stars, and sunglasses ⌐◨-◨ \n\nWe would like to allocate a total budget of 5000 USDC for working on this as the project progresses. Alongside this, we also have the coordination and maintenance of the activities during the period of six months at a cost of 6000 USDC.\n\n**BUDGET: 11000 USDC**\n‎ \n## Roadmap\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/S9KqgmZ.png)\n‎ \n## Team\n\nfabioseva.eth\njp.⌐◨-◨ \n\nWe are very excited to keep spreading the cc0 culture and bringing companies on board with us.

It's incredibly satisfying to witness a tangible representation of the Public Goods brand.

Villa Nouns aims to be the ultimate destination for Nouns fans and newcomers alike, a place that blurs the line between onchain and offchain.\n\nMore than a place to stay, our goal is to create a highly curated, customisable, Nouns-themed venue open to all. By encouraging innovation, art, education and fun experiences, Villa Nouns will reflect the Nouns values and ethos in the real world, while meeting the growing demand for immersive experiences inside and outside of the Nouns community. \n\n**How it works**\n\n- **Book** your stay on Airbnb, or onchain from villanouns.wtf.\n- **Access** the villa with your wallet, and share access with others onchain. No physical keys needed.\n- **Explore** the spaces to discover and interact with the Nouns universe.\n- **Buy** nounish furniture, items or NFTs directly at the villa, with your Ethereum wallet.\n\nRevenue generated from bookings and sales of nounish items will be partly channeled back into the Nouns treasury, as well as shared with partnering communities and Nouns owners.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nWe plan to complete all work in 12 to 24 weeks and start welcoming guests by 2024.\n\n**Team**\n\n- **Management**: Led by the villa owner, an experienced property developer.\n- **Development**: Carried out by dlabs, known for working on projects like Nouns Agora, Optimism, Slice and Juicebox.\n- **Design and art**: Made by skilled architects, designers and artists.\n- **Community**: Nouns owners and communities will be able to partner up with us and become sponsors of the project, further customising the spaces at the villa.\n\n**Funding request**\n\nWe request 153 ETH to give the villa a nounish makeover, cover operational expenses for 1 year, as well as ensure guests have a highly curated experience.\n\nThe villa in its present state is already a sought-after location in the area. Renovating it will only add to its popularity, so execution risks are minimal.\n\nThe primary goal of this project is to explore the potential of a nounish vacation destination, gauging both demand and impact, while keeping risks and costs low for the DAO.\n\nThe villa will stay Nouns-themed for at least 2 years, and possibly indefinitely. This fact together with the growth potential and the future plans outlined below further help justifying the expense.\n\n**Future plans**\n\nThe proposal aims to fund the redesign of the villa and cover operational costs, but our commitment doesn’t stop there. In the coming months we’ll explore the following areas, either autonomously or with further support from the DAO:\n\n- **Nounish home goods**: In collaboration with artists and designers, we’ll craft a line of items and furniture inspired by Nouns. They'll first appear at Villa Nouns and then will be available for everyone to buy, helping to proliferate the Nouns vibe far and wide.\n- **Activities for everyone**: We’ll offer a range of activities to enhance the guest experience further. Think pools, sports areas, dining spots, and curated outdoor adventures for kids and adults.\n- **Builders retreats**: During the low-season we plan to host artists, hackers, and creators to brainstorm and build on nounish ideas, free of charge. Leveraging Prop House for the selection process, Villa Nouns will be temporarily turned into a hub sparking innovative projects and fostering connections in the Nouns ecosystem.\n- **More spaces, more stories**: We plan to open more properties locally and around the world, especially in places rich in art and culture. It’s not just about expanding — it's about building a global community that shares the Nouns spirit.\n- **Franchise model as a public good**: Keeping in line with the CC0 spirit, we’ll be opening doors for property owners to become part of Villa Nouns, while ensuring quality through a rigorous review by our team.\n- **Decentralized ownership**: If the concept proves successful and Nouns DAO wishes to double down on the initiative, it will be possible for the DAO to own or co-own the estate.\n\n![2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fy280LtN/2.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## The nounish experience\n\n![Villa_Nouns_Gate.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/m2Zxzzn0/Villa-Nouns-Gate.jpg)\n\nReferences to many past and future Nouns projects will be integrated with the interiors of the villa and the surrounding natural environment. \n\nGuests will be able to read the Nouns comic, ride Gnars skateboards or surfboards, watch the Nouns movie, learn the history of Nouns, and more. Furthermore, holders of Nouns and derivatives will enjoy an even more personalised experience, customising screens and interiors of the villa based on their NFT holdings.\n\nCertain areas of the house like the bedrooms will be themed on specific Nouns or derivative collections. The overall experience will also evolve over time due to feedback and new projects in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nMost items at the villa will be Nouns themed, like towels, cutlery and home accessories, and some will also be gifted to guests. Among the nounish objects, furniture and decorations, we also plan to build suggestive stone mosaics and murals made by artists in the Nouns community. \n\n![_final.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/TPDBMryW/final.gif)\n\n**Booking and entering the villa**\n\n![main.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/cHc90Td6/main.jpg)\n\nGuests will be able to book the villa on Airbnb, or directly onchain through a custom booking website on [villanouns.wtf](http://villanouns.wtf).\n\nThe villa can be accessed by connecting the wallet on-site and verifying the purchase. Other wallets can also be appointed by the buyer to unlock the villa using delegate.cash.\n\n![iphone mock.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/BntdNW4p/iphone-mock.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## The villa and location\n\n![1.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/VLh7fJP9/1.jpg)\n\nVilla Nouns is an elegant villa located in Sardinia offering stunning views over the La Maddalena Archipelago, one of Italy's most coveted tourist destinations.\n\nThe spacious interior is designed for relaxation and focus, while the outdoor patio and large private garden are perfect for enjoying al fresco dining, relaxing in the Jacuzzi, or immersing in nature.\n\n![Villa_Nouns_Backyard.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/T2JM3qtV/Villa-Nouns-Backyard.jpg)\n\nThe villa includes a large living room with a sofa bed, four bedrooms (three with queen beds, two of which have en-suite bathrooms, and one with twin beds), and three bathrooms with hydromassage showers.\n\nFeatures a 1250 sqm garden, a heated four-person Jacuzzi, high-speed Starlink internet connection, heating and air conditioning, and private parking for up to two cars.\n\n**The location**\n\n![locations.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/htH3rfC4/locations.jpg)\n\nThe villa is located in the heart of Costa Smeralda between the picturesque port town Palau and the popular spot Roccia dell’Orso. Its prime location provides easy access to beautiful beaches and renowned attractions.\n\nThe spectacular Maddalena islands, are just a short boat ride away, while the prestigious Porto Cervo and Porto Rotondo are conveniently close, making it the perfect location to enjoy the most evocative places Sardinia has to offer.\n\nSee more on [villanouns.wtf/gallery](http://villanouns.wtf/gallery)\n\n**Financial aspects**\n\nThe villa has been rented out for several years, with rates between $50 and $110 per person per night based on the season.

Artwork was created by [Facu](https://twitter.com/facuserif)._\n\n---\n\n## Context\n\nEarly in Nouns' history, PH open rounds served an important role within the Nouns ecosystem. It was a place where new builders could receive a few ETH for their early to mid stage ideas with less governance overhead. It was also a way for the DAO to create open competition around a not-too-big commitment of ETH spending, and allow the DAO to harvest the long-tail of ideas rather than being limited to what makes it onchain.\n\nHowever, over the rounds, voter attention waned and PH open rounds started to show its governance weakness. Unlike onchain props where every large voter ultimately paid attention to every prop and voted when necessary, PH open rounds started to go largely unattended. What's worse, rounds increasingly ran the risk of being arbitrarily determined by whichever large voter decided to engage in a given round.\n\nAs a result, the PH open rounds lost much of its legitimacy and we were unable to continue funding through it. Towards the end, we were running 2.5 ETH single-winner rounds every other week, funding a grand total of 5 ETH(!) per month through PH. The last round's outcome—[Open Round 21](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round-21)—was determined by a single large voter as the sole voter of the winning prop.\n\n---\n\n## Proposal\n\nLet's kickstart the PH open rounds again branding them as the \"Nouns Garden\" (to make them more fun and memeable) and run a mandated PH round to elect 24 \"Gardeners\" to vote on the DAO's behalf in these rounds.\n\nRepresentative voting should allow for a more attentive class of voters to vote on each open round while the election ensures that the DAO voters still indirectly maintain influence over the outcomes of PH open rounds. \n\n## More details:\n\n**The Art:**\nThe gardener art work was completed by [Facu](https://twitter.com/facuserif) and funded using PH team's funds.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJyrigaCn.png)\n\n\n**Minting & Distribution:**\nThis proposal mints 24 Nouns Gardener NFTs initially going to the [garden-admin multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD94F65a9BFa4Fcb04FFbc0A64687667FcB28110e) managed by Noun 40 and seneca. If this prop goes through, the PH team will run the Gardener election mandate round. The winners will then be sent the Gardener NFTs which will serve as the voting token in the Nouns Garden rounds. \n\n\n**Gardener Selection:**\nThe Gardener position should be open to nouners and non-nouners alike and everyone that's interested in having fun doing civic service for the dao is welcome to run for the position!\n\nIt's desirable that the PH layer doesn't end up with an entirely disjoint set of voters from the onchain prop voters. Ideally, there's a lot of overlap and as a result the props that win funding at the PH layer will have a good chance of success receiving continued funding onchain if they continue to execute well.\n\nThe Gardener position will be re-elected at a 3 month cadence. 6 months or a year feels like forever in Nouns time. 2 months feels too frequent.\n\n**Gardener Compensation:**\nThe Gardener position will be volunteer roles without specific compensation (outside of the NFTs!)\n\nThere's a notion that delegate positions should be paid b/c reading props and voting is \"work\". However, not all civic service positions are better performed when paid, and there's also definitely fun and prestige in serving as a PH delegate of the DAO. This proposal intends to explore the potential of representative voting at the PH layer without adding financial incentives into the mix.\n\n**Gardener Voting Power:**\nEach Gardener will have the equal voting power (10 votes to spread across props in each round). If we start to observe bad behavior amongst Gardenders such as collusion or self-dealing, then we could institute quadratic voting where the cost of voting for the same prop multiple times goes up linearly such that it is harder to effectuate collusion or self-dealing. We're proposing to start with the simple voting scheme so that we don't unnecessarily introduce complexity.\n\n**Gardener Count:**\n24 was chosen as a size that is materially larger than committee sizes we explored in the past with NSFW (4-10) and DCS pod (5), as to assuage the concern (or perception) that a few people can be influenced to sway outcomes, while also ensuring that the Gardener election is likely to be competitive. It is not hard to imagine that we can elect two dozen worthy candidates. It is not clear that we could elect fifty. \n\n**Garden Rounds:**\nNouns Garden rounds will start off as 5 ETH x 2 winners (10 ETH) rounds every other week. \n\nTwo 10 ETH rounds a month still amounts to a very small percentage of our overall funding allocated through PH open rounds. We spent around ~900 ETH per month the past year, so 20 ETH would be ~2% of our spending rate. Ideally, the open-ended, lower friction, competitive, mid-tail funding the PH open rounds promise can scale further to be 10-20% of our spending, but we likely shouldn't start where we want to end up. We should scale up as builders return to PH and rounds remain competitive even as more funding goes through.\n\nOnce the PH protocol is launched, the DAO could vote on these parameters concretely. For now, we have to trust the PH team to execute these rounds.\n\n**Garden Funding:**\nNouns DAO has granted the Prop House team a total of 550 ETH over the last 2 years to direct towards Nouns DAO related rounds of which 160 ETH remain. These funds will be used towards the first quarter of Nouns Garden (60 ETH).\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\nIf the Nouns Garden is successful and continues after the first quarter, each quarter we will mint new Gardener NFTs such that Gardeners can continue to own their old NFTs as an object that holds provenance of their service. We would not expect Gardeners to transfer or sell their NFTs to someone else before the quarter is over given their reputation is at stake.","slug":"elect-24-nouns-gardeners-as-the-voting-body-for-nouns-prop-house-open-rounds","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0x8b3d875d4055363ad4626dc85643b6d5aa149dae4168f2d5c7db69a4f317356d","reason":""},{"blockNumber":18181585,"blockHash":"0xba8b3afdc81fd2a3ecac0235b57cce8acd32c8221eef5598f8f9bfc9b7553507","transactionIndex":47,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0xeade778e7ca1c7fb5f0ce7af2eae045a723d47179591a9bb1d8a77cbdc42060b","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0x387a161C6b25aA854100aBaED39274e51aaffffd","targets":["0x387a161C6b25aA854100aBaED39274e51aaffffd","0x0fd206FC7A7dBcD5661157eDCb1FFDD0D02A61ff","0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2","0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2"],"signatures":["","createStream(address,uint256,address,uint256,uint256,uint8,address)","deposit()","transfer(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x","0x000000000000000000000000387a161c6b25aa854100abaed39274e51aaffffd000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d02ab486cedc0000000000000000000000000000c02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000065419500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006609f9000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000cbb1ad2860edcbd8fde1394a6036d750db5a6b21","0x","0x000000000000000000000000cbb1ad2860edcbd8fde1394a6036d750db5a6b21000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d02ab486cedc0000"],"description":"# Nouns Meetups\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeiesm2sbkxovkjh2xwigdntehw3i2zre5vwdv6nuobjjdvj3odlkeq)\n\n## TLDR\n\nThis candidate proposal invites nouners to nominate monthly meetup hosts, via the pre-proposal feedback mechanism, after which edits can be made to include them in the attached transactions.

Details have been sent to developers.*\n\n*Update: Ripe has shipped a Pull Request to address the above issue.*","slug":"nouns-meetups","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0xcbc846ddfb022325de9f6157e63ca94a839006aca4c90b25968f424ce424d8a0","reason":"fixed a typo in TLDR section re streaming amount"},{"blockNumber":18181730,"blockHash":"0x54350068e6b5f1d7be447a988b9fddcc0c5657d15dc4a9e47ca2d641584a1013","transactionIndex":69,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0xb05e8092c8ca5f3a08548b9d80cffd305624966da2d1065869a90ec6c7b7f08c","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0xaE65E700f3f8904ac1007d47a5309dD26f8146c0","targets":["0xa555d1Ee16780B2d414eD97f4f169c0740099615"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"description":"# Elect 24 Nouns \"Gardeners\" as the Voting Body for Nouns' Prop House Open Rounds\n\n## TLDR\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1WFfT30n.png)\n\nLet's kickstart the Prop House (PH) open rounds again by branding them as the \"Nouns Garden\" (to make them more fun and memeable) and run a mandated PH round to elect 24 \"Gardeners\" to vote on the DAO's behalf in these rounds.\n\n_Note: This prop was ideated by Noun 40 and was developed in collaboration with seneca. Artwork was created by [Facu](https://twitter.com/facuserif)._\n\n---\n\n## Context\n\nEarly in Nouns' history, PH open rounds served an important role within the Nouns ecosystem. It was a place where new builders could receive a few ETH for their early to mid stage ideas with less governance overhead. It was also a way for the DAO to create open competition around a not-too-big commitment of ETH spending, and allow the DAO to harvest the long-tail of ideas rather than being limited to what makes it onchain.\n\nHowever, over the rounds, voter attention waned and PH open rounds started to show its governance weakness. Unlike onchain props where every large voter ultimately paid attention to every prop and voted when necessary, PH open rounds started to go largely unattended. What's worse, rounds increasingly ran the risk of being arbitrarily determined by whichever large voter decided to engage in a given round.\n\nAs a result, the PH open rounds lost much of its legitimacy and we were unable to continue funding through it. Towards the end, we were running 2.5 ETH single-winner rounds every other week, funding a grand total of 5 ETH(!) per month through PH. The last round's outcome—[Open Round 21](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round-21)—was determined by a single large voter as the sole voter of the winning prop.\n\n---\n\n## Proposal\n\nLet's kickstart the PH open rounds again branding them as the \"Nouns Garden\" (to make them more fun and memeable) and run a mandated PH round to elect 24 \"Gardeners\" to vote on the DAO's behalf in these rounds.\n\nRepresentative voting should allow for a more attentive class of voters to vote on each open round while the election ensures that the DAO voters still indirectly maintain influence over the outcomes of PH open rounds. \n\n## More details:\n\n**The Art:**\nThe gardener art work was completed by [Facu](https://twitter.com/facuserif) and funded using PH team's funds.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJyrigaCn.png)\n\n\n**Minting & Distribution:**\nThis proposal mints 24 Nouns Gardener NFTs initially going to the [garden-admin multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD94F65a9BFa4Fcb04FFbc0A64687667FcB28110e) managed by Noun 40 and seneca. If this prop goes through, the PH team will run the Gardener election mandate round. The winners will then be sent the Gardener NFTs which will serve as the voting token in the Nouns Garden rounds. \n\n\n**Gardener Selection:**\nThe Gardener position should be open to nouners and non-nouners alike and everyone that's interested in having fun doing civic service for the dao is welcome to run for the position!\n\nIt's desirable that the PH layer doesn't end up with an entirely disjoint set of voters from the onchain prop voters. Ideally, there's a lot of overlap and as a result the props that win funding at the PH layer will have a good chance of success receiving continued funding onchain if they continue to execute well.\n\nThe Gardener position will be re-elected at a 3 month cadence. 6 months or a year feels like forever in Nouns time. 2 months feels too frequent.\n\n**Gardener Compensation:**\nThe Gardener position will be volunteer roles without specific compensation (outside of the NFTs!)\n\nThere's a notion that delegate positions should be paid b/c reading props and voting is \"work\". However, not all civic service positions are better performed when paid, and there's also definitely fun and prestige in serving as a PH delegate of the DAO. This proposal intends to explore the potential of representative voting at the PH layer without adding financial incentives into the mix.\n\n**Gardener Voting Power:**\nEach Gardener will have the equal voting power (10 votes to spread across props in each round). If we start to observe bad behavior amongst Gardenders such as collusion or self-dealing, then we could institute quadratic voting where the cost of voting for the same prop multiple times goes up linearly such that it is harder to effectuate collusion or self-dealing. We're proposing to start with the simple voting scheme so that we don't unnecessarily introduce complexity.\n\n**Gardener Count:**\n24 was chosen as a size that is materially larger than committee sizes we explored in the past with NSFW (4-10) and DCS pod (5), as to assuage the concern (or perception) that a few people can be influenced to sway outcomes, while also ensuring that the Gardener election is likely to be competitive. It is not hard to imagine that we can elect two dozen worthy candidates. It is not clear that we could elect fifty. \n\n**Garden Rounds:**\nNouns Garden rounds will start off as 5 ETH x 2 winners (10 ETH) rounds every other week. \n\nTwo 10 ETH rounds a month still amounts to a very small percentage of our overall funding allocated through PH open rounds. We spent around ~900 ETH per month the past year, so 20 ETH would be ~2% of our spending rate. Ideally, the open-ended, lower friction, competitive, mid-tail funding the PH open rounds promise can scale further to be 10-20% of our spending, but we likely shouldn't start where we want to end up. We should scale up as builders return to PH and rounds remain competitive even as more funding goes through.\n\nOnce the PH protocol is launched, the DAO could vote on these parameters concretely. For now, we have to trust the PH team to execute these rounds.\n\n**Garden Funding:**\nNouns DAO has granted the Prop House team a total of 550 ETH over the last 2 years to direct towards Nouns DAO related rounds of which 160 ETH remain. These funds will be used towards the first quarter of Nouns Garden (60 ETH).\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\nIf the Nouns Garden is successful and continues after the first quarter, each quarter we will mint new Gardener NFTs such that Gardeners can continue to own their old NFTs as an object that holds provenance of their service. We would not expect Gardeners to transfer or sell their NFTs to someone else before the quarter is over given their reputation is at stake.","slug":"elect-24-nouns-gardeners-as-the-voting-body-for-nouns-prop-house-open-rounds","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0x922f08415774bb33e4bccc36832179596d35f98b1ffc3645c85f212dd12fb76c","reason":""},{"blockNumber":18181787,"blockHash":"0x96847a57f4bd746233333cbf7056c85666f8fb570dfc988f1056e5b7236557a9","transactionIndex":197,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0x49f9f5f191c1fb0a9de88c8d146e245d43f5fcbec70f3c6ad11800c488117a1b","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0xaE65E700f3f8904ac1007d47a5309dD26f8146c0","targets":["0xF74B146ce44CC162b601deC3BE331784DB111DC1"],"signatures":["createDropWithReferral(string,string,address,uint64,uint16,address,(uint104,uint32,uint64,uint64,uint64,uint64,bytes32),string,string,address)"],"calldatas":["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"],"description":"# Elect 24 Nouns \"Gardeners\" as the Voting Body for Nouns' Prop House Open Rounds\n\n## TLDR\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1WFfT30n.png)\n\nLet's kickstart the Prop House (PH) open rounds again by branding them as the \"Nouns Garden\" (to make them more fun and memeable) and run a mandated PH round to elect 24 \"Gardeners\" to vote on the DAO's behalf in these rounds.\n\n_Note: This prop was ideated by Noun 40 and was developed in collaboration with seneca.

Villa Nouns aims to be the ultimate destination for Nouns fans and newcomers alike, a place that blurs the line between onchain and offchain.\n\nMore than a place to stay, our goal is to create a highly curated, customisable, Nouns-themed venue open to all. By encouraging innovation, art, education and fun experiences, Villa Nouns will reflect the Nouns values and ethos in the real world, while meeting the growing demand for immersive experiences inside and outside of the Nouns community. \n\n**How it works**\n\n- **Book** your stay on Airbnb, or onchain from villanouns.wtf.\n- **Access** the villa with your wallet, and share access with others onchain. No physical keys needed.\n- **Explore** the spaces to discover and interact with the Nouns universe.\n- **Buy** nounish furniture, items or NFTs directly at the villa, with your Ethereum wallet.\n\nRevenue generated from bookings and sales of nounish items will be partly channeled back into the Nouns treasury, as well as shared with partnering communities and Nouns owners.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nWe plan to complete all work in 12 to 24 weeks and start welcoming guests by 2024.\n\n**Team**\n\n- **Management**: Led by the villa owner, an experienced property developer.\n- **Development**: Carried out by dlabs, known for working on projects like Nouns Agora, Optimism, Slice and Juicebox.\n- **Design and art**: Made by skilled architects, designers and artists.\n- **Community**: Nouns owners and communities will be able to partner up with us and become sponsors of the project, further customising the spaces at the villa.\n\n**Funding request**\n\nWe request 153 ETH to give the villa a nounish makeover, cover operational expenses for 1 year, as well as ensure guests have a highly curated experience.\n\nThe villa in its present state is already a sought-after location in the area. Renovating it will only add to its popularity, so execution risks are minimal.\n\nThe primary goal of this project is to explore the potential of a nounish vacation destination, gauging both demand and impact, while keeping risks and costs low for the DAO.\n\nThe villa will stay Nouns-themed for at least 2 years, and possibly indefinitely. This fact together with the growth potential and the future plans outlined below further help justifying the expense.\n\n**Future plans**\n\nThe proposal aims to fund the redesign of the villa and cover operational costs, but our commitment doesn’t stop there. In the coming months we’ll explore the following areas, either autonomously or with further support from the DAO:\n\n- **Nounish home goods**: In collaboration with artists and designers, we’ll craft a line of items and furniture inspired by Nouns. They'll first appear at Villa Nouns and then will be available for everyone to buy, helping to proliferate the Nouns vibe far and wide.\n- **Activities for everyone**: We’ll offer a range of activities to enhance the guest experience further. Think pools, sports areas, dining spots, and curated outdoor adventures for kids and adults.\n- **Builders retreats**: During the low-season we plan to host artists, hackers, and creators to brainstorm and build on nounish ideas, free of charge. Leveraging Prop House for the selection process, Villa Nouns will be temporarily turned into a hub sparking innovative projects and fostering connections in the Nouns ecosystem.\n- **More spaces, more stories**: We plan to open more properties locally and around the world, especially in places rich in art and culture. It’s not just about expanding — it's about building a global community that shares the Nouns spirit.\n- **Franchise model as a public good**: Keeping in line with the CC0 spirit, we’ll be opening doors for property owners to become part of Villa Nouns, while ensuring quality through a rigorous review by our team.\n- **Decentralized ownership**: If the concept proves successful and Nouns DAO wishes to double down on the initiative, it will be possible for the DAO to own or co-own the estate.\n\n![3D Render](https://i.postimg.cc/wvz0Smvj/2-final.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## The nounish experience\n\n![Villa_Nouns_Gate.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/m2Zxzzn0/Villa-Nouns-Gate.jpg)\n\nReferences to many past and future Nouns projects will be integrated with the interiors of the villa and the surrounding natural environment. \n\nGuests will be able to read the Nouns comic, ride Gnars skateboards or surfboards, watch the Nouns movie, learn the history of Nouns, and more. Furthermore, holders of Nouns and derivatives will enjoy an even more personalised experience, customising screens and interiors of the villa based on their NFT holdings.\n\nCertain areas of the house like the bedrooms will be themed on specific Nouns or derivative collections. The overall experience will also evolve over time due to feedback and new projects in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nMost items at the villa will be Nouns themed, like towels, cutlery and home accessories, and some will also be gifted to guests. Among the nounish objects, furniture and decorations, we also plan to build suggestive stone mosaics and murals made by artists in the Nouns community. \n\n![_final.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/TPDBMryW/final.gif)\n\n**Booking and entering the villa**\n\n![main.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/cHc90Td6/main.jpg)\n\nGuests will be able to book the villa on Airbnb, or directly onchain through a custom booking website on [villanouns.wtf](http://villanouns.wtf).\n\nThe villa can be accessed by connecting the wallet on-site and verifying the purchase. Other wallets can also be appointed by the buyer to unlock the villa using delegate.cash.\n\n![iphone mock.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/BntdNW4p/iphone-mock.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## The villa and location\n\n![1.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/VLh7fJP9/1.jpg)\n\nVilla Nouns is an elegant villa located in Sardinia offering stunning views over the La Maddalena Archipelago, one of Italy's most coveted tourist destinations.\n\nThe spacious interior is designed for relaxation and focus, while the outdoor patio and large private garden are perfect for enjoying al fresco dining, relaxing in the Jacuzzi, or immersing in nature.\n\n![2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fy280LtN/2.jpg)\n\nThe villa includes a large living room with a sofa bed, four bedrooms (three with queen beds, two of which have en-suite bathrooms, and one with twin beds), and three bathrooms with hydromassage showers.\n\nFeatures a 1250 sqm garden, a heated four-person Jacuzzi, high-speed Starlink internet connection, heating and air conditioning, and private parking for up to two cars.\n\n![Villa_Nouns_Backyard.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/T2JM3qtV/Villa-Nouns-Backyard.jpg)\n\n**The location**\n\n![locations.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/htH3rfC4/locations.jpg)\n\nThe villa is located in the heart of Costa Smeralda between the picturesque port town Palau and the popular spot Roccia dell’Orso. Its prime location provides easy access to beautiful beaches and renowned attractions.\n\nThe spectacular Maddalena islands, are just a short boat ride away, while the prestigious Porto Cervo and Porto Rotondo are conveniently close, making it the perfect location to enjoy the most evocative places Sardinia has to offer.\n\nSee more on [villanouns.wtf/gallery](http://villanouns.wtf/gallery)\n\n**Financial aspects**\n\nThe villa has been rented out for several years, with rates between $50 and $110 per person per night based on the season. This generated on average $60k of revenues a year, mainly during summer.\n\nBy renovating the villa and adding a private pool, we expect an increase in demand and in turn revenues and prices — especially during summer. During the low season, the villa may also be repurposed for events and host other activities related to Nouns, allowing experimentation with alternative revenue models.\n\n---\n\n## Roadmap\n\n**October 2023 - December 2023**\n- Villa Nouns refurbishment and redesign\n- Development of website and on-chain booking experience\n\n**From January 2024**\n- Open bookings at [villanouns.wtf](http://villanouns.wtf) and start welcoming guests\n\n---\n\n## Funding request\n\n![expenses.png](https://i.postimg.cc/J0mfQGzH/expenses.png)\n\n**Villa redesign and refurbishment - 59 ETH**\n\n- [Renovation] Allocate 45 ETH to upgrade the villa's interior and exterior to incorporate Nouns-themed objects, decorations, furniture, NFT displays, and other technologies to make the guests experience unique.\n- [Professional services] Architects, interior designers and artists involved in the redesign process\n\n**Operational costs - 42 ETH**\n\n- Hire personnel and a villa manager to ensure a smooth nounish experience to guests all year round, as well as handle bookings, communications, maintenance.\n- All operational and management costs involved in bringing Villa Nouns to fruition.\n\n**Development - 40 ETH**\n\n- [Website and contracts integration] Build the [villanouns.wtf](http://villanouns.wtf) platform, with an innovative onchain booking experience.\n- [On-site technology] Make a smart lock which allows access based on onchain bookings, as well as develop and fine-tune the interactive experience at the villa.\n\n**Marketing and promotional material - 12 ETH**\n\n- Create material to promote Villa Nouns as the ultimate nounish destination, such as drone and showcase videos, and professional photo shoots.\n\n**Total ask: 153 ETH**\n\n---\n\nPS.

In addition to being both a Nouns client and a Farcaster client, it allows anyone to host Farcaster spaces where listeners can directly vote for proposals.\n\n![Aburra iOS](https://i.imgur.com/Fm3kQS3.png)\n\n\nOur ambition is not just to create the best Nouns client, but to make all DAOs more Nounish by helping them communicate on top of an open and permissionless protocol (i.e. Farcaster).\n\nWe also hope to use this prop to see what is possible when you combine two of the best web3 ecosystems - we want to push towards a future where open communication protocol is favored over Discord and Twitter.\n\n\n\n### What Aburra has delivered so far\n\n**Applications developed**\n- [Alphacaster.xyz](https://Alphacaster.xyz) and WebView-based mobile apps ([iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/JLPtu4r8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.alphacaster.app) - to be combined with the new app): DAO-specific Farcaster feed, governance notifications, enhanced proposal pages with cast-based comments etc.\n- A proposal bot ([@alphabot](https://warpcast.com/alphabot)) to convert all props, votes, auctions and propdates into casts\n- Beta Aburra app ([iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/uLiAhdUA) and web): Been testing it for two weeks and it now supports Farcaster space with native DAO integrations (proposal and voting)\n\n![Nounish Emoji Reactions in Aburra](https://i.imgur.com/RQCt0fz.jpg)\n\n**Current traction**\n- Aburra has become the default way for Farcaster users to consume proposals and votes. In the last 30 days, it had 3.9K unique visitors.

We've taken this protocol and developed it for the CryptoPunks community first: \n\n    i. **Attribute rarity** - one new DAO Punk will be generated per day. The rarity of attributes will be approximately the same as CryptoPunks.\n    ii. **Duplication Prevention** - we indexed all 10,000 CryptoPunks. No DAO Punks will ever be a duplicate of a CryptoPunk. Once a DAO Punk is minted, it is added to the index to prevent its own duplication.\n    iii. **Treasury co-ownership** - One CryptoPunk = 1 vote. One DAO Punk = 1 vote.\n\n2. This protocol will be generalized in partnership with [Zora](https://twitter.com/ourZORA) and [Builder DAO](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/265) via [Nouns Builder](https://twitter.com/nounsbuilder) to create a ***Collections+*** protocol for any existing NFT community to \"Nounsify\" itself.\n\n# Why start with CryptoPunks?\nCryptoPunks is the [largest NFT collection by market cap](https://nftpricefloor.com/?sort=ranking&dir=asc), but is communally, completely cash poor. CryptoPunks were released by [Larva Labs](https://www.larvalabs.com/) on June 23rd, 2017 with a free mint price and zero trading fees. As a result, no community funds were ever accumulated, and Punk holders are unable to do any of the cool things Nouns holders get to do today.\n\nBecause CryptoPunk holders are so high profile, yet financially incapacitated, they are particularly susceptible to adopt a retrofitted, self-sustaining mechanism, like Nouns. This provides an especially high probability of success with this experiment.\n\nIf we can demonstrate a successful execution of the Nouns protocol for the CryptoPunks community, it will serve as an inspiration for all other prominent (but potentially nascent) NFT collections to Nounsify themselves, too. The success of a DAOpunks collection could easily become one of the largest proliferators of the Nouns ethos, while simultaneously catalyzing widespread NFT coordination and market sentiment for select and willing communities.\n\n# Request\n\n* 100 ETH transferred to seed the Nounsified DAO treasury for the CryptoPunks + DAOpunks community, collectively known as the Punkers DAO.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nThe request is effectively structured as a 100 ETH delegation to the owners of all CryptoPunks in exchange for them adopting the Nouns model and distributing funds with comparable intent (and vibes).\n\nSimilar to Zora's [proposal #167](https://nouns.wtf/vote/167), we are requesting that NounsDAO pay it forward rather than reimburse us for:\n\n* approximately 50 ETH worth of development we paid out of our own pocket.\n* 12 months of time we spent independently researching, developing, and fine tuning the first  *Collections+* implementation.\n\nWe do not want reimbursement, we want proliferation!\n\n## Deliverables\n\nIn return for seeding 100 ETH into the Punker DAO, we will (or have already):\n\n* Deploy the implementation for the CryptoPunks community to mainnet\n* Open source the codebase of this first Collections+ implementation\n* Open source the research we conducted on CryptoPunks in building this project\n* Open source the research we've begun for other collections\n* Generalize the protocol in partnership with Zora & Builder DAO via Nouns Builder\n* Steward the Punker DAO initiatives & community\n\n## Generalizing the Protocol\n\n> \"If I had to suggest only one short term focus after L2 it would be funding and generalizing the Punks+ work by [@cr](https://warpcast.com/cr). Show up to the website and start a canon DAO for any existing project.\"\n>`-` [Jacob Horne](https://twitter.com/js_horne), Founder of Zora ^[https://warpcast.com/jacob/0xabeab6] ([see also](https://warpcast.com/jacob/0xd00662))\n\nCryptoPunks are dramatically different than other NFT collections:\n\n* They do not use the ERC721 standard - they use ERC20\n* They have multiple, mutually exclusive sub-classes of traits\n    * *Example: `{hair, hat}` are in the same sub-class*\n* They have single-attribute (non-class based) rules of exclusion\n    * *Example: `welding goggles` are `glasses` that can be worn with `hair` but not with a `hat`*\n* They have multiple visual implementations of the same attribute\n    * *Example: `vr glasses` have 2 different pixel patterns depending on if the punk is `female` or not*\n\nThese unique characteristics, which are not found in other collections, required us to create a lot of custom logic. As a result, our codebase is not yet immediately generalizable.\n\nTo achieve a generalizable state, we will work in cooperation with Zora and Builder DAO to port our architecture into their Nouns Builder protocol, which is already extremely accessible and widely adopted. This port will allow any NFT community to deploy their own Nounified DAO using Zora's intuitive, no-code tools.\n\n# Team\n* I am [CBob.eth](https://twitter.com/CBobRobison), founder of [meTokens](https://twitter.com/metokens) and former [Hoard](https://twitter.com/hoardexchange), [Golem Foundation](https://twitter.com/GolemFoundation), and OMG Network team member.

Luckily, I was able to discover my hidden talent for creating small sculptures and since then I’ve achieved things I never thought I could. \n\nThis brings me to Nouns - I love how you all support the creative arts with your treasury. My [foundation](https://www.thewiganfoundation.com/) is heavily focused on helping the youth to find FAAIR - Focus, Awe, Ambition, Inspiration, Resilience. Many of the projects and people in your community reflect the ideals that I strive to instill in the youth and that gets me excited to make this proposal to you all.\n\nFor this proposal, I want to turn the Noggles into one of my signature micro-sculptures. This will take me 9~ weeks to create. When I finish the sculpture, I will encase it in acrylic and place it in a custom Nouns-themed microscope display box. \n\n![tiny](https://i.imgur.com/ZeWpibE.png)\n\nTo make these sculptures, I hold my breath to slow down my heart rate and chisel in-between my heartbeats. Sometimes I use the tremors caused by my heartbeat to jackhammer the material. Much like how the Nouns are sculpting an infinite art piece with every onchain proposal, every vote and every Noun created every day.\n\nI’m requesting 45 ETH to bring the Noggles micro-sculpture to life.

Proposers of winning props will be able to claim a noun of their choice from the treasury along with ETH equivalent to 1/3 of the recent 30 day auction price to assist with the tax burden of being awarded a noun.\n\nAll props since inception should be eligible. Props are targets of voting in order to have an objective eligibility criteria as well as have the voting conversation centered around prop outcomes rather than people.\n\n---\n\n## Context\n\nI've [long been an advocate](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/retro-house-retroactive-reward-house/1757) for some form of retroactive rewards towards our best props. It serves two goals of providing upside incentive that is missing currently (you're not financially incentivized to do well beyond just delivering the prop) along with providing a retrospective feedback moment that we can all learn from (all prop builders are incentivized to give good [prop updates](https://www.propdates.wtf/) since they want to win; nouns voters end up expressing onchain what props they value).\n\nThe last time we had a really concrete conversation around doing retroactive rewards for props was [this conversation](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-build-retro-house-retroactive-reward-house/1810/13). Yitong (pre-Agora) suggested leading this effort. It was well received as an idea but at the time we thought Prop House would ultimately handle retro rewards as well and decided to table implementation. Unfortunately, we got super side-tracked as a community and never really got to implementing something here. \n\nSeason 3 is when we should finally make this happen. I suggest we have the prize be nouns since we now have a good amount in the treasury post-fork and because it feels right that nouns are also earnable in the world building game that is nouns beyond just only being up for purchase.\n\nAnother motivation is to reduce the burden of prop builders having to make the [awkward ask](https://www.nounsagora.com/proposals/371) of including nouns in their props. I would much rather it be proactively clear that if your prop is one of the best props of the quarter, you'll be getting a noun even without having made such negotiation ahead of funding.","slug":"nouns-retro-awards","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0x5c1ac3fe2beb2392f643d62094f85020581c9a5b1ebd4f1a0616768309d6a5af","reason":"Changed the nouns awarded per quarter down to four from the initial ten.

Nouns Stories is seeking $1,795,000 to develop, produce and distribute over 50 Animated Nouns Shorts on a global scale with nine time Emmy-Award winners Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, along with 50 of the best animators in the world.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyIYuo7gp.png)\n\n[Nouns Short Shorts Trailer](https://youtu.be/QxrvHepTh38)\n\n## NOUNS: FRONT AND CENTER\n\nMost sources of financing for animated content are tied to networks that move at a snail’s pace and that are not considered artist friendly. This is where Nouns steps in to disrupt the system. We want to provide the proper funding to attract the world’s best animators, help them bring their ideas to life, and in so doing — put Nouns DAO on the map as the number one source for innovative, diverse storytelling in animation. \n\nNot only that, but by making Nouns DAO the seed funder we’re putting the Nouns IP (and the brand’s aesthetic) front and center on a series of innovative and hilarious shorts that are bound to get massive amounts of attention with animation fans all around the world. What better way to spread the Nounish vibes and garner some positive attention?\n\n## PERSON, PLACE & THING: 3 THEMATIC ROUNDS, 50 CREATORS, 1 YEAR\n\nOver the course of the next twelve months we’ll onboard 50 of the world’s most innovate animators to create engaging animated shorts featuring great characters, engaging storylines, and Nounish vibes. By expanding the run times and upping the budgets, we’ll give the animators the opportunity to produce even MORE engaging visuals and storylines!\n\nWe’ll roll out the animated shorts over three themed rounds:\n\n- Round 1 - stories about theme 1\n- Round 2-  stories about theme 2\n- Round 3 - stories about *theme 3*\n\nOther than requiring the films to feature Nouns characters or Noggles, we’ll encourage the animators to go absolutely wild with the best and funniest ideas: the ones that may not exist within the walled gardens of Hollywood. Because not every artist has the bandwidth to produce longer form shorts, we’ll keep the short short 15 second+ format for some of our creators. \n\nIn total the three themed rounds will feature:\n\n- 12 x 2-3 minute S*horts*\n- 38 x 15-30 second S*hort Shorts*\n- 3 original shorts by the team at Stoopid Buddy\n\n## 50 OF THE WORLD’S BEST\n\nWe’ll cast our net wide to onboard the best animators we can muster, and by allowing them the creative freedom to ***************do what they do***************, we believe we’ll get the very best out of them. Not only that, but many of these talented folks already have huge followings online which will further expose the Nouns DAO to their legions of fans when we go live with the shorts.\n\n## 3 STOOPID SHORTS\n\nTo kick off each thematic round, Stoopid Buddy Stoodios will pour all of their Nouns-lovin’-energy (see: Rose Parade / forthcoming Nouns Documentary) into making something truly special for Nouns — a love letter in animation like only they can. They’ll tap their A-list Buddies to create and voice these fully original mini-movies, creating some hilarious cohesion to what promises to be a wildly eclectic program!\n\n## CC0 Heroes\n\nAs we did in the first Nouns Short Shorts Festival, we’ll encourage each animator to embrace Nounish culture by opting in to making their shorts CC0. While it won’t be required, opting into to CC0 will make their films eligible for some damn [fine awards](https://twitter.com/nouns_stories/status/1670029456688418818) and cash prizes!\n\n## OH YEAH…ONE MORE THING\n\nWe’ll be hosting a *Nountastic* IRL animation festival to premiere these amazing shorts, attracting Nounish animation fans from all over the world.   Why do this when we could just hide behind the safety of our computer monitors? Because as we experienced with the first screening at [Braindead Studios](https://studios.wearebraindead.com/) in Los Angeles (in conjunction with the Melbourne screening at Pixel), there’s an *energy* and *magic* to bringing communities together to share in a truly unique experience that will help put Nouns DAO on the map. We’ll invite all our industry pals, and will we live-stream the whole thing just as we did before? Abso-fucking-lutely!\n\n## IMPACT: NETWORK EFFECT\n\nThe first round of shorts garnered over a million views in the first month of release. Most of these views were native to the creator channels of the animators themselves — providing a whole new audience for Nouns. This time around, we’ll not only continue to seek out animators with their own audiences, but amplify views across all platforms with a social media marketing campaign and enlisting a PR firm to bolster [awareness](https://www.animationmagazine.net/2023/07/stoopid-buddy-stoodios-chris-waters-unzips-about-the-nouns-short-shorts-festival/) of what we’re up to. On top of this, to build anticipation and excitment for the festival as the year unfolds, we'll create original promotional content, including teasers and trailers, behind the scenes footage, and creator profiles.\n\n## THE NOUNS STORIES TEAM\n\n**Stoopid Buddy Stoodios**\n\n9 time Emmy-winning studio behind *Robot Chicken,* and producer of over 1,000 hours of animated television **including: *Crossing Swords, Mickey Saves Christmas, and Marvel’s MODOK.* Stoopid Buddy is a pioneering independent studio that has helped drive the tremendous growth in adult animation over the past decade. Co-founder Eric Towner and Head of Development Chris Waters have deep roots in the Nouns ecosystem. Their first proposal funded the Nouns Rose Parade Float (seen by over 30 million people) and both are producers of the forthcoming documentary about Nouns.\n\n**Walter Newman**\n\nFormer SVP of program development at Adult Swim who oversaw such shows as Rick & Morty, Tuca and Bertie, Smiling Friends, Black Dynamite, and more.

Not only will we be identifying top-tier talent from our own networks of creators, but we’ll also be recruiting on a global scale to identify and onboard the next generation of up-and-coming animation talent.\n\nWe’ll be managing and coordinating a massive effort to create (literally) decentralized content and creatively packaging it in a way that connects with audiences around the globe. Not only that, but we’ll be tapping our extensive network to best position our exposure and distribution of the program online, at festivals, and beyond. We’ll be coordinating a social media / marketing and PR strategy, as well as presenting “behind the scenes” access and status updates to the DAO as this undertaking fully develops.\n\n## BEYOND THE PROP\n\nThe Nouns Stories team has over 613,620 hours of experience in animation development, production, marketing, distribution and sales. Our team is well positioned to take these Nounish creations beyond what is promised in the proposal. Our hope is we can continue to develop the best-of-the-best beyond their existence as a short, and seed Nounish content and characters into the mainstream zeitgeist. Think about it — *The Simpsons*, *South Park*, *Rick & Morty*, and hell, even *Robot Chicken*, all got their start **********as animated shorts.**********\n\n## THAT’S A WRAP!\n\nAnimation drives cultural conversation. There’s a white space in animation that Nouns DAO is uniquely positioned to fill. Nimble development. Artist friendly. Global reach. We believe there’s a more “Nounish” way to produce the next great animated shorts, and that we have the team to help find them and make them. \n\nFor Nouns, there’s an opportunity to be front-and-center in one of the most passionate arenas in pop culture and create break-out successes that proliferate the meme.\n\nOur team has poured our hearts and souls into the Nouns experiment since it’s inception, and we’ve proven we can develop world-class animation and execute on ambitious ideas. We believe in a new way of generating content and organizing passionate communities of creators and fans. Together we can change the culture and build Nouns DAO into the next great destination for animation, so slap on your dang Noggles and let’s do this!!\n\n## BUDGET BREAKDOWN\n\n**TOTAL: $1,795,000 USDC** \n50% distributed upon commencement, 50% upon completion of first round.\n\n**Animation** **************Content - $1,270,000**************\n\n- 12 x 2-3 min shorts (3 rounds, 4 per round, $20k/short) - $240K\n- 38 x 15-30 sec Short Shorts (3 rounds, 12 per round, $7.5k/short) - $285K\n- Three Original Shorts + packaging from Stoopid Buddy - $450K\n- Nounish Trailers / Behind-the-Scenes / Festival Recap Docs / Creator Profiles - $150K\n- “CC0 Hero” Awards (3 rounds, 20k per round) - $45K\n- Animation Festival - $100K\n\n**Management and Production - $430K** \n\n- Exec Producer Fees - $300K\n    - artist outreach and curation\n    - creative oversight and curation\n    - promotion\n- Producer - $100K\n    - Animator management\n    - Scheduling, Accounting and Deliverables\n- Web build and upkeep - $30K\n\n************************************General Operations - $95K************************************\n\n- Publicist - $15K\n- Social Media Mgr - $15K\n- Legal+Accounting - $20K\n- Event Planner - $20K\n- Team Travel & Accommodation - allow $25K","slug":"nouns-stories--stoopid-buddy--shorts-galore","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0x387429154b93027964c08bf3be42f0ae2062da8168df69d5301aa60642076e82","reason":""},{"blockNumber":18238828,"blockHash":"0x75d1007e11edbe7e59bc31c7bc7b286adba47c48a345392c31dbc94fcd0db3fe","transactionIndex":90,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0x57449b5a942c649096170b76cdf541884396a730d7989656d71a46f28293fb1b","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0x7549DCAad7d31af14DD8a4ADF7cF8241D04Fa91c","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5","0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)","","sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x00000000000000000000000035aa2666c8bc0aeb68ea64b463cf57a74bdbf977000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d18c2e2800","0x","0x00000000000000000000000035aa2666c8bc0aeb68ea64b463cf57a74bdbf977000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d062283600"],"description":"# Nouns Stories + Stoopid Buddy = Shorts Galore\n\n# \n\n## TLDR\n\nOn the heels of [Prop 180](https://nouns.wtf/vote/180)’s and [Prop 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73)’s overwhelming success, we’re rallying the creative forces once again on what promises to be our biggest and most impactful proposal yet.

Payment via steaming.\n\n\n### Overview\n\nFarcaster represents a unique opportunity to decentralize Nouns communication and bring Nounishness to more onchain organizations.\n\nAt Aburra, we have been building at the intersection of Nouns and Farcaster since early 2023 and have won Nouns Hack Week for our MVP v1 in April.\n\nToday, Aburra has evolved significantly since its v1. In addition to being both a Nouns client and a Farcaster client, it allows anyone to host Farcaster spaces where listeners can directly vote for proposals.\n\n![Aburra iOS](https://i.imgur.com/Fm3kQS3.png)\n\n\nOur ambition is not just to create the best Nouns client, but to make all DAOs more Nounish by helping them communicate on top of an open and permissionless protocol (i.e. Farcaster).\n\nWe also hope to use this prop to see what is possible when you combine two of the best web3 ecosystems - we want to push towards a future where open communication protocol is favored over Discord and Twitter.\n\n\n\n### What Aburra has delivered so far\n\n**Applications developed**\n- [Alphacaster.xyz](https://Alphacaster.xyz) and WebView-based mobile apps ([iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/JLPtu4r8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.alphacaster.app) - to be combined with the new app): DAO-specific Farcaster feed, governance notifications, enhanced proposal pages with cast-based comments etc.\n- A proposal bot ([@alphabot](https://warpcast.com/alphabot)) to convert all props, votes, auctions and propdates into casts\n- Beta Aburra app ([iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/uLiAhdUA) and web): Been testing it for two weeks and it now supports Farcaster space with native DAO integrations (proposal and voting)\n\n![Nounish Emoji Reactions in Aburra](https://i.imgur.com/RQCt0fz.jpg)\n\n**Current traction**\n- Aburra has become the default way for Farcaster users to consume proposals and votes. In the last 30 days, it had 3.9K unique visitors. It also has Warpcast [integrations](https://warpcast.com/dwr.eth/0x3cec05).\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oT7WtK7.png)\n\n- Since we started testing the new app in early Sep, we've hosted 9 Farcaster spaces for Nouns, Purple and Nouns Builder. 80 users have installed the [app](https://testflight.apple.com/join/uLiAhdUA). More Nounish spaces are in [the](https://warpcast.com/aburra) [pipeline](https://warpcast.com/toadyhawk.eth/0x64bd48).\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rXUDxAX.png)\n\n### Plan for the next 3 months\n- Full integration with Farcaster channels, including reading Nouns channel directly in\nthe app (and in any space)\n- Phase out the old Alphacaster app and merge all functionality into Aburra: this\nincludes implementing everything (governance feed, proposal pages etc.) natively,\ninstead of using WebView, which will significantly improve UX\n- Better space UX, with native DAO features (NFT minting, droposal, smoother voting etc.)\n- Integrate with more Nounish DAOs (and others!)\n- Launch Android\n\n### Team\n\nAburra has 2 full-time team members, billzh.eth ([@billzh](https://warpcast.com/billzh) on FC) and blingbling.eth ([@16](https://warpcast.com/16) on FC). Both of us are experienced developers and have built production-grade consumer applications.\n\nSo far we have received 12.9 ETH grants from Nouns Builder ([9 ETH](https://www.alphacaster.xyz/dao/BuilderDAO/prop/48)), Nouns Hack Week ([3 ETH](https://prop.house/nouns/hack-week-developers-developers-developers/5256)) and Warpcast ([~0.9 ETH](https://warpcast.com/v/0xd74872)).\n\n\n### Ask\n\nThe ask is 24 ETH (0.2% of current treasury) to help us continue to build Aburra for the next 3 months. That is, 8 ETH per month for a team of two.\n\nThe team is lean and we are confident to deliver a top-tier application with significantly lower cost than comparable clients (House of Nouns at [95](https://nouns.wtf/vote/242) ETH, Agora at [220](https://nouns.wtf/vote/154) ETH and Prop Lot at [60](https://nouns.wtf/vote/244) ETH).","slug":"aburra-fka-alphacaster-nouns-x-farcaster","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0x09c29f1620f0c9aa7ab99eee29b7ed5744c91859bb0216a924b394482ef927a0","reason":""},{"blockNumber":18240311,"blockHash":"0x543728da3d5c1d78378ef7d8042e8efb42005a070c024b409a3d30010e1f9122","transactionIndex":133,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0x6dd247176254f84c1d5b063b39408d4488934b7c432e4cf365b81abde8046d5d","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0x6ab075abfA7cdD7B19FA83663b1f2a83e4A957e3","targets":["0xbc3ed6B537f2980e66f396Fe14210A56ba3f72C4","0x94b4fb16893C0Fb4E470eEf2559C24FD87FEd5F1"],"signatures":["",""],"calldatas":["0x","0x"],"description":"# Retro Fund Wilson for Propdates & Refill Gas Refund Balance\n\n[Wilson](https://twitter.com/WilsonCusack) built the initial [Propdates](updates.wtf) contract, which has been getting a lot of use and positive feedback from the community.\n\nI propose retro funding Wilson 5 ETH for his work on the contracts, as well as refilling the Gas Refund which reimburses gas costs for updates posted on successful transactions.

Born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Bob has not only transformed the skateboarding landscape but has also left an indelible mark on global culture. Gifting Noun 542, adorned with a skateboard head, to this skateboarding maestro would be a fitting tribute to his legacy.\n\n## 💥 Cultural Impact\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifoecnwfhetsm3zpkw5342ai6v4lckbo2xmo7nkww45idczou6mfy)\n\n▶️ *[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=wlL4NPOrYck) to watch the above video*\n\nBob's influence transcends skateboarding. He's been a cultural icon, inspiring countless individuals to challenge the status quo and redefine boundaries.

Through his institutes and foundations, he has consistently worked towards the betterment of society. From promoting skateboarding among underprivileged kids to championing environmental causes, his philanthropic efforts are commendable.\n\n## 🫂 Nounish Contributions\n\nBob's engagement with the NFT world and Nouns DAO is not just as an icon but as an active contributor.

Through this initiative, he's been onboarding individuals into the world of technology, offering programming classes, and witnessing transformative progress. The launch of [SkateboardingCares.com](http://SkateboardingCares.com), a collective that's making \"concrete waves,\" is powered by [That's Gnarly](https://thatsgnar.ly) and further amplifies his dedication to merging skateboarding with technological advancements.\n\n[![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeidmc4oopw35og6e37gtv7fpppurjnfm3zcrjfurymgwf76rnyknl4)](https://twitter.com/bobburnquist/status/1604636743332159488)\n\nBob's advocacy for the NFT space is evident in his active participation at various events.

His creativity and groundbreaking track record are testament to what he could, and already does, bring to Nouns. If there are times where his full focus is needed elsewhere, there's ample opportunity for thoughtful representation through delegation, either by his team, vast network with deep industry experience, or as part of educational endeavours at his institute. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeideeb4fbkn2i3s37fmq5tnkzr3krmi5l4wyza7sx7a2tcchkwddge)\n\n▶️ *[Click here](https://www.voxels.com/play?coords=E@1007E,1112N) to visit to Bob's Voxels property (got a tour on our most recent call)* \n\nI've followed Bob's career since I was a child, and as an amateur skateboarder, I'm thrilled to have even met him, let alone be collaborating with him directly.

Furthermore, I wish to extend mine hand in assistance, particularly in matters of design, being the possessor of Noun 35 (initially pondering delegation, but the path appeared labyrinthine).\n\nAs the venerable Uncle Ben once spoke, \"With great power comes great responsibility,\" and I hold in high esteem the ethos of donning the Noggles. Servitude to a morally sound objective larger than oneself in a collective pursuit of a better world. From a distance, I have been an observer and contributor for some time, and in this year, I have grown more entwined with the Lil Nouns DAO. \n\nRevelling in the craft of bootlegging, the creation and collection of memes, the design of interactive experiences, and the exploration of far-off lands, I have trod upon five continents over the last decade, practicing the arts of the corporeal and the digital. Presently, I dwell in Costa Rica, seeking to establish a cooperative of teachers. In the realm of the United Kingdom, I oversee a cooperative dedicated to matters of morality and protocol development (EVM) since 2019: [mutuals.fca.org.uk](https://mutuals.fca.org.uk/Search/Society/30459). On the first day of the year 2022, we unveiled an [open-source protocol](https://github.com/borgs-app/borgs/blob/main/README.md) including Noggles as a trait, though, alas, they were made exceedingly scarce, and only a couple have been minted thus far... (;◨_◨) [The first](https://borgs.app/borgs/1778) and [the second](https://borgs.app/borgs/2145), both possess a somewhat peculiar visage.\n\nAs my moniker implies, I go by the name of pipe, so becoming Noun 35 would be most agreeable.

Nouns Stories is seeking $1,795,000 to develop, produce and distribute over 50 Animated Nouns Shorts on a global scale with nine time Emmy-Award winners Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, along with 50 of the best animators in the world.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyIYuo7gp.png)\n\n[Nouns Short Shorts Trailer](https://youtu.be/QxrvHepTh38)\n\n## NOUNS: FRONT AND CENTER\n\nMost sources of financing for animated content are tied to networks that move at a snail’s pace and that are not considered artist friendly. This is where Nouns steps in to disrupt the system. We want to provide the proper funding to attract the world’s best animators, help them bring their ideas to life, and in so doing — put Nouns DAO on the map as the number one source for innovative, diverse storytelling in animation. \n\nNot only that, but by making Nouns DAO the seed funder we’re putting the Nouns IP (and the brand’s aesthetic) front and center on a series of innovative and hilarious shorts that are bound to get massive amounts of attention with animation fans all around the world. What better way to spread the Nounish vibes and garner some positive attention?\n\n## PERSON, PLACE & THING: 3 THEMATIC ROUNDS, 50 CREATORS, 1 YEAR\n\nOver the course of the next twelve months we’ll onboard 50 of the world’s most innovate animators to create engaging animated shorts featuring great characters, engaging storylines, and Nounish vibes. By expanding the run times and upping the budgets, we’ll give the animators the opportunity to produce even MORE engaging visuals and storylines!\n\nWe’ll roll out the animated shorts over three themed rounds. Other than requiring the films to feature Nouns characters or Noggles, we’ll encourage the animators to go absolutely wild with the best and funniest ideas: the ones that may not exist within the walled gardens of Hollywood. Because not every artist has the bandwidth to produce longer form shorts, we’ll keep the Short Shorts 15 second+ format for some of our creators. \n\nIn total the three themed rounds will feature:\n\n- 12 x 2-3 minute Shorts\n- 38 x 15-30 second Short Shorts\n- 3 original shorts by the team at Stoopid Buddy\n\n## 50 OF THE WORLD’S BEST\n\nWe’ll cast our net wide to onboard the best animators we can muster, and by allowing them the creative freedom to ***************do what they do***************, we believe we’ll get the very best out of them. Not only that, but many of these talented folks already have huge followings online which will further expose the Nouns DAO to their legions of fans when we go live with the shorts and the post them to their own socials.\n\n## 3 STOOPID SHORTS\n\nTo kick off each thematic round, Stoopid Buddy Stoodios will pour all of their Nouns-lovin’-energy (see: Rose Parade / forthcoming Nouns Documentary) into making something truly special for Nouns — a love letter in animation like only they can. They’ll tap their A-list Buddies to create and voice these fully original mini-movies, creating some hilarious cohesion to what promises to be a wildly eclectic program!\n\n## CC0 Heroes\n\nAs we did in the first Nouns Short Shorts Festival, we’ll encourage each animator to embrace Nounish culture by opting in to making their shorts CC0. While it won’t be required, opting into to CC0 will make their films eligible for some damn [fine awards](https://twitter.com/nouns_stories/status/1670029456688418818) and cash prizes!\n\n## OH YEAH…ONE MORE THING\n\nWe’ll be hosting a *Nountastic* IRL animation festival to premiere these amazing shorts, attracting Nounish animation fans from all over the world.   Why do this when we could just hide behind the safety of our computer monitors? Because as we experienced with the first screening at [Braindead Studios](https://studios.wearebraindead.com/) in Los Angeles (in conjunction with the Melbourne screening at Pixel), there’s an *energy* and *magic* to bringing communities together to share in a truly unique experience that will help put Nouns DAO on the map. We’ll invite all our industry pals, and will we live-stream the whole thing just as we did before? Abso-fucking-lutely!\n\n## IMPACT: NETWORK EFFECT\n\nThe first round of shorts garnered over **a million views** in the first month of release across creator and owned social channels. Most of these views were native to the creator channels of the animators themselves — providing a whole new audience for Nouns. This time around, we’ll not only continue to seek out animators with their own audiences, but amplify views across all platforms with a social media marketing campaign and enlisting a PR firm to bolster [awareness](https://www.animationmagazine.net/2023/07/stoopid-buddy-stoodios-chris-waters-unzips-about-the-nouns-short-shorts-festival/) of what we’re up to. On top of this, to build anticipation and excitment for the festival as the year unfolds, we'll create original promotional content, including teasers and trailers, behind the scenes footage, and creator profiles.\nCheck out some of the postings from our first Shorts Shorts Festival below!\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy2i70Kxa.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ctm_qiRBIre/)\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/By3o7AtxT.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CttDyBBo33G/)\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S13oQ0Yxp.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtgbaWPJ9iK/)\n\n\n## THE NOUNS STORIES TEAM\n\n**Stoopid Buddy Stoodios**\n\n9 time Emmy-winning studio behind *Robot Chicken,* and producer of over 1,000 hours of animated television **including: *Crossing Swords, Mickey Saves Christmas, and Marvel’s MODOK.* Stoopid Buddy is a pioneering independent studio that has helped drive the tremendous growth in adult animation over the past decade. Co-founder Eric Towner and Head of Development Chris Waters have deep roots in the Nouns ecosystem. Their first proposal funded the Nouns Rose Parade Float (seen by over 30 million people) and both are producers of the forthcoming documentary about Nouns.\n\n**Walter Newman**\n\nFormer SVP of program development at Adult Swim who oversaw such shows as Rick & Morty, Tuca and Bertie, Smiling Friends, Black Dynamite, and more. Walter brings network experience and a deep talent roster to the Nouns Stories team.\n\n**Goldy** / **Pixel**\n\n**[Goldy's](https://twitter.com/Goldypix)** Oscar-Shortlisted hybrid production studio is behind **[nounish ⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/nounish)** and the animated short film \"**[The Wizards Hat](https://twitter.com/nouns_stories/status/1570433066900017152?s=20&t=T_vYbAun_YQEsZUlEwfjSA)**\" from the original Nouns Stories proposal.\n\n**Joshua Fisher**\n\nManager of Grammy-winning music producers, music publisher, SharkDAO Rep, Ugly Noun, The Nouns Square co-founder, Nouns DAO Builder and Nouns narrative advocate.\n\n**Joel Cares**\n\nCEO of **[Lobal Global](https://lobal.global/) / [ANOA](https://anoa.ca)**, creator of **[Nerman](https://twitter.com/nermanbot)**, founding member of **[Nouncil](http://nouncil.wtf/)**, creative director @ [**JoelCares.net**](https://joelcares.net).\n\n## OUR ROLES\n\nWe’ve got the experience, knowledge, and relationships to successfully pull off this wildly ambitious proposal. Not only will we be identifying top-tier talent from our own networks of creators, but we’ll also be recruiting on a global scale to identify and onboard the next generation of up-and-coming animation talent.\n\nWe’ll be managing and coordinating a massive effort to create decentralized content and creatively package it in a way that connects with audiences around the globe. Not only that, but we’ll be tapping our extensive network to best position our exposure and distribution of the program online, at festivals, and beyond. We’ll be coordinating a social media / marketing and PR strategy, as well as presenting “behind the scenes” access and status updates to the DAO as this undertaking fully develops.\n\n## BEYOND THE PROP\n\nThe Nouns Stories team has over 613,620ish hours of experience in animation development, production, marketing, distribution and sales. Our team is well positioned to take these Nounish creations beyond what is promised in the proposal. Our hope is we can continue to develop the best-of-the-best beyond their existence as a short, and seed Nounish content and characters into the mainstream zeitgeist. Think about it — *The Simpsons*, *South Park*, *Rick & Morty*, and hell, even *Robot Chicken*, all got their start **********as animated shorts.**********\n\n## THAT’S A WRAP!\n\nAnimation drives cultural conversation. There’s a white space in animation that Nouns DAO is uniquely positioned to fill. Nimble development. Artist friendly. Global reach. We believe there’s a more “Nounish” way to produce the next great animated shorts, and that we have the team to help find them and make them. \n\nFor Nouns, there’s an opportunity to be front-and-center in one of the most passionate arenas in pop culture and create break-out successes that proliferate the meme.\n\nOur team has poured our hearts and souls into the Nouns experiment since it’s inception, and we’ve proven we can develop world-class animation and execute on ambitious ideas. We believe in a new way of generating content and organizing passionate communities of creators and fans. Together we can change the culture and build Nouns DAO into the next great destination for animation, so slap on your dang Noggles and let’s do this!!\n\n## BUDGET BREAKDOWN\n\n**TOTAL: $1,795,000 USDC** \n50% distributed upon commencement, 50% upon completion of first round.\n\n**Animation** **************Content - $1,270,000**************\n\n- 12 x 2-3 min shorts (3 rounds, 4 per round, $20k/short) - $240K\n- 38 x 15-30 sec Short Shorts (3 rounds, 12 to 13 shorts per round, $7.5k/short) - $285K\n- Three Original Shorts + packaging from Stoopid Buddy - $450K\n- Nounish Trailers / Behind-the-Scenes / Festival Recap Docs / Creator Profiles - $150K\n- “CC0 Hero” Awards (3 rounds, 15K per round) - $45K\n- Animation Festival - $100K\n\n**Management and Production - $430K** \n\n- Exec Producer Fees - $300K\n    - artist outreach and curation\n    - creative oversight and curation\n    - promotion\n- Producer - $100K\n    - Animator management\n    - Scheduling, Accounting and Deliverables\n- Web build and upkeep - $30K\n\n************************************General Operations - $95K************************************\n\n- Publicist - $15K\n- Social Media Mgr - $15K\n- Legal+Accounting - $20K\n- Event Planner - $20K\n- Team Travel & Accommodation - allow $25K","slug":"nouns-stories--stoopid-buddy--shorts-galore","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0xfda632105fb401da28793e8229283811088209c46712b215a6e1dee642317127","reason":""},{"blockNumber":18272186,"blockHash":"0x62cff35a5d8f089bb8a7efa01e675e591ac3d17d86d2bfc94b6e4166bdbc5cd9","transactionIndex":98,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0x6a457b3e33a25b3d63748511f435ce74a84bf4cf6174a1dae7d8d92a38545c73","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0x32d1A53f6709a03f4b6cf4cb0501204ba188d4f5","targets":["0x32d1A53f6709a03f4b6cf4cb0501204ba188d4f5"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"description":"# 🧈 The Churn\n\n//This is a proposal to protocolize distribution of Nouns that have been returned to the treasury via a permissionless forum similar to Prop House, allocated by Nouner vote. \n\n\nOne way to understand the falling demand / fork cycle is as a referendum on the protocol's ability to maintain alignment with an expanding voter base. \n\nWe may want to enshrine, as the highest order mandate for voters, that we aim to produce not near-term roi but a rich, magnetic culture anchored by a progressively more distributed governance network. With or without v3, it's more important token-holders stay than that they come in the first place. \n\nThus\n\nRather than be focused on protecting price/bv, we could instead prioritize minimizing forks, not just when auction prices are low but high as well. The two objectives are likely at odds in the long term. The dao has already proved that it will de-circulate Nouns if it serves near-term capital interests. Attempting to peg auction price to treasury balance via a periodic burn does not fundamentally change this.\n\nBecause\n\nAs long as natural demand is falling (price<bv), the highest marginal buyer at auction is still likely to be a value extractor. This is self-evident when fork threshold < allowed burn frequency, but is also the case generally. There is no way to eliminate the arb under this market condition via burn, meaning there can be be little/no supply expansion under price contraction.  \n\nAnd \n\nWhen periods of price & supply expansion (price>bv) reverse, the dao will be under significant & possible cascading exit pressure in the form of profit-taking. We may find the token supply ultimately little changed. Nouns lifers will be palliated by an increased voting share in the dao (as with fork # 0), rather than rightfully held to task for failing to value progressive decentralization, inclusivity and organic leadership churn.  \n\nAnd So \n\nI suggest we encode the recirculation of treasury nouns at a predictable cadence after forks (N/year until fully distributed). \n\nFork execution schedules a series of on-chain prop house-style rounds (perhaps triggered by a modified auction settlement process?) where anyone can apply to be granted a Noun via a weighted vote governed by Noun-owners. Imo the most visceral/memetic steady-state value for N is 365. We can ramp up responsibly but lets not take an eternity. \n\nThis maximizes alignment on growing the Nouns holder base, rather than near-term auction demand, minimizes arb interest and downstream rugs. It affords ardent Nouns believers a direct, merit-based pathway to agency in the network, and demonstrates we are immutably committed to a diverse and expanding range of interesting voices contributing to the conversation- the highest good for us, Ethereum, and beyond.\n\nNouns belong to the world.","slug":"free-the-nouns","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0x0787b5c3a9ff75493ab9d9def07b05f0949f2a23d3fae6b1a5261b81febb01a2","reason":""},{"blockNumber":18278599,"blockHash":"0x73819b6fbbee73710efa16aa288aad2556ca68e675ebd0d51cf460e80b308876","transactionIndex":106,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0x9f349df5038041733a6a224d701dcbe24deab5d810dac261022e1f67407edc56","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0xffAF62026731607c5087a44BBa2CbCE1Fc908d99","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x00000000000000000000000079095391743e0f017a16c388de6a6a3f175a5cd500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006fc23ac00"],"description":"# 🔥 The Burn: audit funding\n\nWe are planning to propose an upgrade that implements [The Burn](https://w.mirror.xyz/AmHOzH-FQZVO3IhGXHSvCRxRSf2MO6VCZdmMwNEIyKE). The goals for the burn are described in the blog post above by wilson.\n\nThis is a first draft of the proposal candidate through which we will ask the DAO to fund one or two audits of the implementation. We are putting it up even before we have quotes from auditors, in order to raise awareness among voters, stimulate the conversation, and listen to feedback.\n\n## Technical spec\n\nWe plan to deploy a new contract, with a single function that lets burn excess ETH from the timelock.\n\n### How much will be burned?\n\nExcess ETH is defined as the difference between the treasury value denominated in ETH, and: adjusted_total_supply * trailing_N_day_mean_auction_price.\n\nadjusted_total_supply is the number of minted nouns, excluding nouns held by the treasury or in the escrow contract.\n\nIn order to calculate the treasury value in ETH, the contract will consider only ETH, stETH, rETH & WETH. All other assets are ignored.\n\nThe number of auctions looked at when calculating the mean price is a configurable parameter; we suggest starting with 90.\n\nExample based on numbers close to actuals:\n\nTreasury has 2857 ETH, 10830 stETH, 228 rETH.\nAdjusted total supply: 394.\nMean price of last 90 auctions: 30 ETH.\nTreasury value in ETH: 2857 + 10830 + 247 (228 worth of rETH) = 13,934 ETH.\nExcess ETH: 13,934 - 30 * 394 = 2114 ETH.\n\n### What is burned?\n\nOnly ETH is burned. If the Nouns runs out of ETH, it will need to swap other assets (e.g. stETH) into ETH to allow for more burn.\n\n### When can it be called?\n\nThe goal is for the burn to happen at predictable times. One parameter will define what will be the first noun id at which the first burn can happen. Another parameter will define how many noun ids need to be minted before the next burn can happen.\n\nExample:\n\nSuppose the first noun id is set to 1000, and the number of nouns between burns is set to 100. The first burn will be possible once a noun with id 1000 is minted. The next burn would be possible once a noun with id 1100 is minted.\n\nEven if the first burn actually occurs when noun 1002 is auctioned, the next burn will still be possible starting id 1100.\n\n\n### Timelock upgrade\n\nThe timelock will be upgraded to a new version which will allow the burner contract to call it an burn ETH.\n\nThe timelock will only allow the burner contract to call it.\n\nThe address of the burner contract is a configurable param. Setting it to the zero address is effectively turning off the burn mechanism.\n\n\n## Audit costs\n\nOur plan is to undergo a deep code review with solimander, and an audit with [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/). In a bit more detail:\n\n1. Soli review (+ verbs fix things)\n2. Sherlock audit\n3. Verbs fix things + soli reviews fixes\n4. Sherlock mitigation review\n\nWe are asking for 30K USDC to be sent to the Tech Grants Pod multisig to pay for the audit.\n\n## Next steps\n\nFunding the audit will let us know the DAO wants the burn to be deployed. Once funded we will finalize the code, undergo the audit, and follow up with a proposal to upgrade the auction house contract and the treasury contract.\n\nThe upgrade will leave the burn disabled, since it seems best to separate the deployment of the mechanism from reaching consensus on its parameters. We will of course support any voters who will want to follow up with a proposal to set the burn parameters.\n\nIt's also worthwhile for voters to consider converting stETH into ETH ahead of the burn, since as mentioned above this simple design only burns native ETH.\n\n## Appendix: pseudocode\n\nExcessETHBurner:\n\n```\n\n// configurable params:\n\nuint numPastAuctions;\n\nuint nextBurnNounId;\n\nuint mintsBetweenBurns;\n\nfunction burnExcessETH() {\n\n    if (auction().nounId &lt; nextBurnNounId) revert('Not yet');\n\n    \n\n    allowedTreasuryInETH = adjustTotalSupply() * meanAuctionPrice();\n\n    excessETH = treasuryValueInETH() - allowedTreasuryInETH;\n\n    amountToBurn = min(excessETH, timelock.balance);\n\n    \n\n    nextBurnNounId += mintsBetweenBurns;\n\n    \n\n    timelock.burnETH(amountToBurn);\n\n}\n\nfunction treasuryValueInETH() {\n\n    return timelock.balance + stETH.balanceOf(timelock) + \n\n        wETH.balanceOf(timelock) + rETH.getEthValue(rETH.balanceOf(timelock));\n\n}\n\nfunction meanAuctionPrice() {\n\n    return mean(auctionHouse.prices(numPastAuctions));\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\n## Appendix: current asset breakdown\n\nAt the time of writing this text, [according to Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71):\n\n\n\n* Total treasury value is roughly $23.15M.\n* Its two main assets are:\n    * ETH at $4.391M (2631.493 ETH).\n    * stETH at $18.061M (10830.768 stETH).\n* These two assets alone make up over 96.7% of the total treasury value.\n* USDC is roughly 1.1% of the treasury, and we’re comfortable ignoring it for the sake of code simplicity.\n* wstETH is roughly 0.11% and is ignored as well.","slug":"-the-burn-heads-up-and-audit-funding-placeholder","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0x6de57094c055ef9fe21ead07369290d43b9c1126d644c839eea8cd147e79ae22","reason":"updated audit plan and funds request, and next steps summary"},{"blockNumber":18279190,"blockHash":"0x100654b5031f6972e06f01c885d6f00f45e4d3e86c1e7ae099c8ffc5f09be174","transactionIndex":84,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0x04e0ad7e074893a3836ed6adfbab3433c8fa1de23190260a30519cd0570d7653","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0x653A57C482BEE12dD52bf000a405B91533F77b26","targets":["0x653A57C482BEE12dD52bf000a405B91533F77b26"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"description":"# Villa Nouns  \n\n## Summary\n\n![3D Render](https://i.postimg.cc/wvPnykQT/DEFINITIVO-4-K-2.jpg)\n\nWe’re transforming a villa by the sea in Italy into the first-ever Nouns vacation rental.\n\nImagine a living art gallery, where nounish NFTs, items, and projects are not just showcased but become the center of a unique experience. Villa Nouns aims to be the ultimate destination for Nouns fans and newcomers alike, a place that blurs the line between onchain and offchain.\n\nMore than a place to stay, our goal is to create a highly curated, customisable, Nouns-themed venue open to all. By encouraging innovation, art, education and fun experiences, Villa Nouns will reflect the Nouns values and ethos in the real world, while meeting the growing demand for immersive experiences inside and outside of the Nouns community. \n\n**How it works**\n\n- **Book** your stay on Airbnb, or onchain from villanouns.wtf.\n- **Access** the villa with your wallet, and share access with others onchain. No physical keys needed.\n- **Explore** the spaces to discover and interact with the Nouns universe.\n- **Buy** nounish furniture, items or NFTs directly at the villa, with your Ethereum wallet.\n\nRevenue generated from bookings and sales of nounish items will be partly channeled back into the Nouns treasury, as well as shared with partnering communities and Nouns owners.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nWe plan to complete all work in 12 to 24 weeks and start welcoming guests by 2024.\n\n**Team**\n\n- **Management**: Led by the villa owner, an experienced property developer.\n- **Development**: Carried out by dlabs, known for working on projects like Nouns Agora, Optimism, Slice and Juicebox.\n- **Design and art**: Made by skilled architects, designers and artists.\n- **Community**: Nouns owners and communities will be able to partner up with us and become sponsors of the project, further customising the spaces at the villa.\n\n**Funding request**\n\nWe request 121 ETH to give the villa a nounish makeover, cover operational expenses for 1 year, as well as ensure guests have a highly curated experience.\n\nThe villa in its present state is already a sought-after location in the area. Renovating it will only add to its popularity, so execution risks are minimal.\n\nThe primary goal of this project is to explore the potential of a nounish vacation destination, gauging both demand and impact, while keeping risks and costs low for the DAO.\n\nThe villa will stay Nouns-themed for at least 2 years, and possibly indefinitely. This fact together with the growth potential and the future plans outlined below further help justifying the expense.\n\n**Future plans**\n\nThe proposal aims to fund the redesign of the villa and cover operational costs, but our commitment doesn’t stop there. In the coming months we’ll explore the following areas, either autonomously or with further support from the DAO:\n\n- **Nounish home goods**: In collaboration with artists and designers, we’ll craft a line of items and furniture inspired by Nouns. They'll first appear at Villa Nouns and then will be available for everyone to buy, helping to proliferate the Nouns vibe far and wide.\n- **Activities for everyone**: We’ll offer a range of activities to enhance the guest experience further. Think pools, sports areas, dining spots, and curated outdoor adventures for kids and adults.\n- **Builders retreats**: During the low-season we plan to host artists, hackers, and creators to brainstorm and build on nounish ideas, free of charge. Leveraging Prop House for the selection process, Villa Nouns will be temporarily turned into a hub sparking innovative projects and fostering connections in the Nouns ecosystem.\n- **More spaces, more stories**: We plan to open more properties locally and around the world, especially in places rich in art and culture. It’s not just about expanding — it's about building a global community that shares the Nouns spirit.\n- **Franchise model as a public good**: Keeping in line with the CC0 spirit, we’ll be opening doors for property owners to become part of Villa Nouns, while ensuring quality through a rigorous review by our team.\n- **Decentralized ownership**: If the concept proves successful and Nouns DAO wishes to double down on the initiative, it will be possible for the DAO to own or co-own the estate.\n\n![3D Render](https://i.postimg.cc/wvz0Smvj/2-final.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## The nounish experience\n\n![Villa_Nouns_Gate.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/m2Zxzzn0/Villa-Nouns-Gate.jpg)\n\nReferences to many past and future Nouns projects will be integrated with the interiors of the villa and the surrounding natural environment. \n\nGuests will be able to read the Nouns comic, ride Gnars skateboards or surfboards, watch the Nouns movie, learn the history of Nouns, and more.

Its prime location provides easy access to beautiful beaches and renowned attractions.\n\nThe spectacular Maddalena islands, are just a short boat ride away, while the prestigious Porto Cervo and Porto Rotondo are conveniently close, making it the perfect location to enjoy the most evocative places Sardinia has to offer.\n\nSee more on [villanouns.wtf/gallery](http://villanouns.wtf/gallery)\n\n**Financial aspects**\n\nThe villa has been rented out for several years, with rates between $50 and $110 per person per night based on the season. This generated on average $60k of revenues a year, mainly during summer.\n\nBy renovating the villa we expect an increase in demand and in turn revenues and prices — especially during summer. During the low season, the villa may also be repurposed for events and host other activities related to Nouns, allowing experimentation in coordination with the DAO and the exploration of alternative revenue models.\n\n---\n\n## Roadmap\n\n**October 2023 - December 2023**\n- Villa Nouns refurbishment and redesign\n- Development of website and on-chain booking experience\n\n**From January 2024**\n- Open bookings at [villanouns.wtf](http://villanouns.wtf) and start welcoming guests\n\n---\n\n## Funding request\n\n![expenses.png](https://i.postimg.cc/j54qKt9g/Screenshot-2023-10-04-at-21-10-22.png)\n\n**Villa redesign and refurbishment - 59 ETH**\n\n- [Renovation] Allocate 45 ETH to upgrade the villa's interior and exterior to incorporate Nouns-themed objects, decorations, furniture, NFT displays, and other technologies to make the guests experience unique.\n- [Professional services] Architects, interior designers and artists involved in the redesign process\n\n**Development - 40 ETH**\n\n- [Website and contracts integration] Build the [villanouns.wtf](http://villanouns.wtf) platform, with an innovative onchain booking experience.\n- [On-site technology] Make a smart lock which allows access based on onchain bookings, as well as develop and fine-tune the interactive experience at the villa.\n\n**Marketing and operational costs - 22 ETH**\n\n- Create material to promote Villa Nouns as the ultimate nounish destination, such as drone and showcase videos, and professional photo shoots.\n- All operational and management costs involved in bringing Villa Nouns to fruition.\n\n**Total ask: 121 ETH**\n\n---\n\nPS.

We want to set up a Prop House to fund public goods projects and artworks within the GLITCH collective and beyond, where the highest-ranked artworks will be submitted as a Droposal for Nouns.\n\n**Total funds requested: 25 ETH**\n* 10 ETH for the GLITCH residency (see below for more granular budget)\n* 15 ETH for the Prop House Treasury\n\n![GLITCH Community](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=126XxNSe_cLiVf0vE7tPmRHelc9c28-dg)\n\n# GLITCH 3.0\nThe GLITCH art collective is organising the third edition of its art residency. It’s a 2 weeks long event gathering blockchain / AI artists and engineers, collaborating on the creation of new NFT collections inspired by the notion of CC-0 and Remix. GLITCH is a unique opportunity to build new types of public goods, past editions have led to the creation of several protocols (e.g. REMIX NFT, IMPACT NFT) as well as an open source NFT Token-Bound Licensing standard to embed Creative Commons-like licensing conditions directly into NFTs.\n\n## ART RESIDENCY\nGLITCH is a two-week focused residency at an 18th century chateau in France. About 40-50 participants will be invited to create, imagine, develop theories, build projects and standards aimed at supporting a new creative ecosystem of open creativity and digital abundance in the blockchain art world.  The participants will be a highly curated group of creative and smart individuals actively engaged with NFTs, art, music and AI. The goal is to bring the right people, in the right place, at the right time, and then let the magic happen.\n\nAt GLITCH, we strive to empower people with ideas, visions, and expertise, while providing space for our attendees to reach deep into their minds and forge better models together. We exist to disrupt the status quo and to manifest positive solutions for society.\nThe outcomes of the residency will be, first and foremost, a tight community of value-aligned people eager to collaborate with one another, new collaborations and synergies in order to shape the world of tomorrow. The residency will also promote a variety of new initiatives about how to promote the value of openness and interoperability in the blockchain art world. Expected deliverables include new NFT protocols that encourage remix and creativity, new NFT protocols geared towards maximization of social and environmental impact, as well as a variety of collaborative exhibitions for NFT artists. All content produced within the residency will be released and made available to all under Creative Commons licenses.\n\nMore details about the third edition of GLITCH can be found at the [following link](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1xWfm3HfZJHDdlb8-7bhrVE4fWmNJDOhd)\n\n![GLITCH overview](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1EHB6ZJxOhGZOb1wWWz1YobCez6UViYop)\n\n# GLITCH Prop House & Droposal\n\nGLITCH is an avant-garde hub for blockchain art and innovation. We aim to utilize Prop House's pioneering mechanism to fund the creation of artworks and public goods that will be stewarded and/or mentored by the members of the GLITCH collective (artists, engineers, curators, etc). By harnessing Prop House's governance system, we aim to democratize the funding process, foster cross-pollination between the Nouns and GLITCH community, and support projects that contribute significantly to the blockchain art ecosystem.\n\n## GLITCH Prop House\n\nGLITCH will create a Prop House round for blockchain artists and engineers to propose artworks and public goods to be created during the GLITCH residency. Artworks can range from NFTs to physical installations; public good initiatives can range from developing open standard or open-source tools, organizing educational events, or supporting initiatives to promote the blockchain art space. Collaboration between artists, technologists, and other stakeholders will be strongly encouraged, leading to the creation of groundbreaking initiatives in the blockchain art world, and beyond.\n\nAnyone can submit a proposal for a new artwork or public good and request a maximum of 3 ETH. The GLITCH and Nouns community members assess the proposals and vote to allocate funds to the initiatives that align with GLITCH's mission of openness, collaboration, and innovation. Votes can be cast both by Nouns holders and GLITCH-NFT holders (we will distribute a GLITCH-NFT to all current and previous GLITCH participants, around 90 people total). Nouns and GLITCH-NFTs have an equal weight of one vote. We want Nouns holders to have a say on the selection of the proposed projects so that we can get feedback from outside of the event, to ensure that the projects that are funded are relevant not only to the GLITCH community, but also to other communities across the Nouns and NFT space.\n\n## GLITCH DROPOSAL\n\nThe successful proposals, if applicable (i.e. to the extent that they include the production of a digital artwork), will be proposed as a Droposal for Nouns. The proceeds from the Droposal will be split equally between Nouns DAO, GLITCH and the creator(s) of the artwork.\n\n![GLITCH people](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LWgWO67u5aDXgF7vP5rQej8bkIDPJL1M)\n\n# FUNDINGS\n\nThe full costs of the residency is **$60,000** (inclusive of accommodation and catering for all participants). We are requesting **10 ETH** to cover 1/4 of the costs. \n\nThe Prop House will fund proposals for up to **3 ETH per proposal**.

It’s not just about expanding — it's about building a global community that shares the Nouns spirit.\n- **Franchise model as a public good**: Keeping in line with the CC0 spirit, we’ll be opening doors for property owners to become part of Villa Nouns, while ensuring quality through a rigorous review by our team.\n- **Decentralized ownership**: If the concept proves successful and Nouns DAO wishes to double down on the initiative, it will be possible for the DAO to own or co-own the estate.\n\n![3D Render](https://i.postimg.cc/wvz0Smvj/2-final.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## The nounish experience\n\n![Villa_Nouns_Gate.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/m2Zxzzn0/Villa-Nouns-Gate.jpg)\n\nReferences to many past and future Nouns projects will be integrated with the interiors of the villa and the surrounding natural environment. \n\nGuests will be able to read the Nouns comic, ride Gnars skateboards or surfboards, watch the Nouns movie, learn the history of Nouns, and more. Furthermore, holders of Nouns and derivatives will enjoy an even more personalised experience, customising screens and interiors of the villa based on their NFT holdings.\n\nCertain areas of the house like the bedrooms will be themed on specific Nouns or derivative collections. The overall experience will also evolve over time due to feedback and new projects in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nMost items at the villa will be Nouns themed, like towels, cutlery and home accessories, and some will also be gifted to guests. Among the nounish objects, furniture and decorations, we also plan to build suggestive stone mosaics and murals made by artists in the Nouns community. \n\n![_final.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/TPDBMryW/final.gif)\n\n**Booking and entering the villa**\n\n![main.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/cHc90Td6/main.jpg)\n\nGuests will be able to book the villa on Airbnb, or directly onchain through a custom booking website on [villanouns.wtf](http://villanouns.wtf).\n\nThe villa can be accessed by connecting the wallet on-site and verifying the purchase. Other wallets can also be appointed by the buyer to unlock the villa using delegate.cash.\n\n![iphone mock.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/BntdNW4p/iphone-mock.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## The villa and location\n\n![1.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/VLh7fJP9/1.jpg)\n\nVilla Nouns is an elegant villa located in Sardinia offering stunning views over the La Maddalena Archipelago, one of Italy's most coveted tourist destinations.\n\nThe spacious interior is designed for relaxation and focus, while the outdoor patio and large private garden are perfect for enjoying al fresco dining, relaxing in the Jacuzzi, or immersing in nature.\n\n![2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fy280LtN/2.jpg)\n\nThe villa includes a large living room with a sofa bed, four bedrooms (three with queen beds, two of which have en-suite bathrooms, and one with twin beds), and three bathrooms with hydromassage showers.\n\nFeatures a 1250 sqm garden, a heated four-person Jacuzzi, high-speed Starlink internet connection, heating and air conditioning, and private parking for up to two cars.\n\n![Villa_Nouns_Backyard.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/T2JM3qtV/Villa-Nouns-Backyard.jpg)\n\n**The location**\n\n![locations.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/htH3rfC4/locations.jpg)\n\nThe villa is located in the heart of Costa Smeralda between the picturesque port town Palau and the popular spot Roccia dell’Orso. Its prime location provides easy access to beautiful beaches and renowned attractions.\n\nThe spectacular Maddalena islands, are just a short boat ride away, while the prestigious Porto Cervo and Porto Rotondo are conveniently close, making it the perfect location to enjoy the most evocative places Sardinia has to offer.\n\nSee more on [villanouns.wtf/gallery](http://villanouns.wtf/gallery)\n\n**Financial aspects**\n\nThe villa has been rented out for several years, with rates between $50 and $110 per person per night based on the season. This generated on average $60k of revenues a year, mainly during summer.\n\nBy renovating the villa we expect an increase in demand and in turn revenues and prices — especially during summer. During the low season, the villa may also be repurposed for events and host other activities related to Nouns, allowing experimentation in coordination with the DAO and the exploration of alternative revenue models.\n\n---\n\n## Roadmap\n\n**October 2023 - December 2023**\n- Villa Nouns refurbishment and redesign\n- Development of website and on-chain booking experience\n\n**From January 2024**\n- Open bookings at [villanouns.wtf](http://villanouns.wtf) and start welcoming guests\n\n---\n\n## Funding request\n\n![expenses.png](https://i.postimg.cc/j54qKt9g/Screenshot-2023-10-04-at-21-10-22.png)\n\n**Villa redesign and refurbishment - 59 ETH**\n\n- [Renovation] Allocate 45 ETH to upgrade the villa's interior and exterior to incorporate Nouns-themed objects, decorations, furniture, NFT displays, and other technologies to make the guests experience unique.\n- [Professional services] Architects, interior designers and artists involved in the redesign process\n\n**Development - 40 ETH**\n\n- [Website and contracts integration] Build the [villanouns.wtf](http://villanouns.wtf) platform, with an innovative onchain booking experience.\n- [On-site technology] Make a smart lock which allows access based on onchain bookings, as well as develop and fine-tune the interactive experience at the villa.\n\n**Marketing and operational costs - 22 ETH**\n\n- Create material to promote Villa Nouns as the ultimate nounish destination, such as drone and showcase videos, and professional photo shoots.\n- All operational and management costs involved in bringing Villa Nouns to fruition.\n\n**Total ask: 121 ETH**\n\n---\n\nPS.

Decked out in noggles, experiencing Nouns stories, interacting with vibrant Nouns sculptures and characters, and immersing themselves in a world where disability, disadvantage, or illness doesn't define them. Instead, they're celebrated for their individuality and spirit, all while being introduced to the imaginative universe of Nouns. This is the magic of the Variety Kids Xmas Party, and with your support, we can make it an unforgettable experience.*\n### Introduction:\nThe Variety Kids Xmas Party is an annual event held in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia that brings joy and inclusion to over 5,000 Victorian children facing diverse challenges. We seek Nouns DAO's support of 28.99 ETH to enhance this iconic event, held across 39,000 square metres, with the Nouns bringing the FUN and ENTERTAINMENT, ensuring a memorable experience for all attendees including:\n* 5,000 kids in need\n* 3,000 parents and carers\n* 600 corporate volunteers\n* 100 VIP guests\n\nThis year's party will be held in mid-December 2023.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SybKqjyga.jpg)\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Background:\nFor over three decades, the Variety Kids Xmas Party has been a beacon of hope for kids in need. Held at the Melbourne Convention Exhibition Centre, this event has touched the lives of over 165,000 children since its inception in 1986. The massive event is completely FREE for 5,000 children and 3,000 carers to attend, ensuring that each child receives a gift and experiences an inclusive day of fun, activities, stage entertainment, carnival rides, all-abilities sport and an all-important visit from Santa. For many, this celebration is the only one they have during the Christmas season, and the gifts they receive at the party are often the only ones they receive. The Variety Kids Xmas Party is a safe space for children living with disabilities or experiencing disadvantage or illness, allowing them to be themselves without fear of judgment from their peers. This remarkable event is made possible by the dedication and hard work of the small Variety team and over 600 volunteers.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkJSDa1xp.jpg)\n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Profound Impact:\nThe Variety Kids Xmas Party is more than just a day of fun; it&#39;s a lifeline for families who often feel isolated or overlooked. For many children, the event offers a rare opportunity to experience joy, laughter, and a sense of belonging. Parents often remark on the transformative effect of the party, noting the boost in their children's confidence and self-esteem. The ripple effect extends beyond the children to their families, providing them with a much-needed respite and the chance to see their children thrive in a supportive environment. The memories created during the party serve as a source of strength and inspiration for families throughout the year.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkJ5cjkxT.jpg)\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Testimonials:\n\"You have no idea what this means to us. Without Variety, we were having no Christmas.\" Kayla\n\n“Being on your own and battling to afford the basics, you are so conscious of trying to make Christmas special. I will be forever thankful that Variety did that for me and my boys this Christmas.” Shelly, parent of Jaxon and Dylan.\n\nTo make the day even more special, each child receives a gift bag full of age-appropriate toys and games (including Nounish items) to take home and enjoy. For some children, this was the only gift they received that Christmas.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryvQ5jklT.jpg)\n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Videos and imagery:\n\nWatch the party in action – news coverage of last year's event \n[7 News Click here to play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8bpybGRlZY&themeRefresh=1)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H17HSTyea.png)\n\n[9 News Click here to play ](https://youtu.be/GXfgo3frPww)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJx9B6yxa.png)\n\nMeet some of the families who attend and hear what it means to them \n[Click here to watch Seth & Teagan's Variety Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhk80WxPSyk)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1gBLaJea.png)\n\n**Click here to view our gallery** of [pictures of the day](https://photos.app.goo.gl/GATPZpPnU5TEy7nTA) \n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ A Nounish Christmas Deliverables:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1AOkl6x6.png)\n\n\nTo elevate the 2023 Variety Kids Xmas Party, we propose the Nouns brand activations in synchronicity with the Variety red branding where Nouns bring the FUN and ENTERTAINMENT!

On average, previous Xmas Parties have cost USD $160,000 and have been funded from Variety's non-profit funds.\n\nVariety is committed to continue to fund this event with the knowledge that it is crucial for thousands of families whose children are living with disabilities, illnesses, or experiencing disadvantages. It serves as a day of joy and inclusion, often providing the only Christmas celebration and gifts these children receive. For over three decades, this event has been sustained by year-round contributions from our dedicated individual of donors and fundraisers.\n\nThe current cost-of-living crisis has intensified the needs of our most vulnerable families, increasing the demand for our support. Simultaneously, community donations have become less frequent, as they are no longer as possible for some individuals as they once were.\n\nIf the Nouns prop passes to fund the 2023 event, the money previously allocated for it will be redirected to our individual grant program, which provides essential items like wheelchairs, communication devices, scholarships, education programs and assistance dogs for kids experiencing disadvantage or living with conditions including Cerebral Palsy, Down Syndrome, Autism, global development delay, muscular dystrophy, brain\ninjury, spinal injury, rare and chronic disease and more.\n\nVariety – the Children’s Charity request a total of ~USDC 47,479 (28.99 ETH) to fund the Nouns brand fun and entertainment zones.

Scholarships are also awarded to nurture the talents of children living with disadvantages or disabilities. And, Variety hosts events that infuse joy, light, and laughter into the lives of these children and their families – with our keystone event being the Variety Kids Xmas Party.\n\nPioneering the intersection of charity and technology, Variety Victoria has been at the forefront of web 3 and crypto philanthropy in Australia. In addition to accepting crypto donations for over 2 years, their innovative approach includes, joining and submitting a successful proposal with Blueberry DAO, being recognised as the charity of choice for notable entities like NFT Melbourne and Oshi Gallery and being an active beneficiary of various NFT auctions.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1U3hjkgT.jpg)\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJrMGWnyp.png)","slug":"a-very-nounish---kids-xmas-party-for-5000-kids-in-need","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0x4a51fcb16b3762a903df36b6737e3c483cebaf92a198f64fac884c94b2d2c453","reason":""},{"blockNumber":18294155,"blockHash":"0xbc436d8c1d1094e5a24c22c55b917f975ab1c019412bb281e83e517610e02716","transactionIndex":17,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0x8ed5ab455559941dd8367d3afb069b69af8e434a1aaee0ab04d2afc4d63ff180","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","targets":["0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"description":"# Unstake all stETH from Lido\n\n*This candidate draft is put forward with the hopes of further feedback from the community.*\n\n#### **Proposal**\nAs good Ethereum citizens [1], I propose we lead by example and unstake all [2] stETH. We currently hold a total of ~10836 stETH in the [treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJSEZLTeT.png)\n\n\n#### **Problems with Lido**\nI recommend watching the video below to better understand the concerns with Lido, but in short:\n-  Ethereum epochs require 2/3rds of attestors voting to finalize;\n- Lido's node operators control almost 1/3rd of all validators (32.2% at the time of writing);\n- Lido DAO decides who can be a node operator;\n-  In every Lido DAO vote, over 50% of power is controlled by [just 2 or 3 participants](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth);\n-  That makes Lido an Ethereum 'middleware' with a huge amount of centralized power;\n-  The risks are not unrecoverable but serious enough that we ought to choose a better path.\n\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/1k18c2V.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0ddkSa1ZuI&ab_channel=Web3Builders)\n*Lido conversation starts at 17m30s, and ends at 27m30s. Another section on risks starts at 47m30s.*\n\n#### **More resources**\n- The blog post by Danny Ryan referenced in the video:\n[https://github.com/djrtwo/writing/blob/main/docs/2022-05-30_the-risks-of-lsd.md](https://github.com/djrtwo/writing/blob/main/docs/2022-05-30_the-risks-of-lsd.md)\n- Another Evan van Ness podcast with Ben Edgington (issues with governance start around 8min mark):\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGpHXTepcA&ab_channel=Web3Builders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGpHXTepcA&ab_channel=Web3Builders)\n- Recent Hasu post on future of Lido:\n[https://research.lido.fi/t/hasus-goose-submission-proposed-goals-for-lido-dao-to-consider/5590](https://research.lido.fi/t/hasus-goose-submission-proposed-goals-for-lido-dao-to-consider/5590)\n- Dune dashboard displaying Lido dominance:\n[https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJXenQTlp.png)\n\n\n---\n\n#### **Transactions (technicalities)**\nUnstaking from Lido is a [two-step process](https://stake.lido.fi/withdrawals/request). This proposal deals with step one.\n\n- Approve Withdrawal Queue to transfer any stETH amount owned by the DAO.\n    - `0xae7ab96520DE3A18E5e111B5EaAb095312D7fE84.approve(0x889edC2eDab5f40e902b864aD4d7AdE8E412F9B1, uint256.max)`\n- Request to withdraw 10837.24266 stETH. The request is split into batches up to 1K ETH due to a Lido [withdrawal limit](https://etherscan.io/address/0x889edC2eDab5f40e902b864aD4d7AdE8E412F9B1#readProxyContract#F6).\n    - `0x889edC2eDab5f40e902b864aD4d7AdE8E412F9B1.requestWithdrawals([1000 ether, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 837.24266 ether], 0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71)`\n\n---\n\n#### **Notes**\n[1] In anticipation of the burn mech, it's necessary for us to reduce our stETH holdings since excess treasury value is denominated in vanilla eth. By reducing stETH, we are _also_ being good Nouns citizens and playing by the intended rules of the burn mechanic.\n\n[2] Assuming this proposal executes, its up to the dao to decide if we want to re-stake, presumably with another solution. This proposal does not make any value judgment around whether Nouns DAO should stake or not; it is solely concerned about the risks of Lido.\n\n*Thanks to Wiz for reading a draft, and Elad for helping with transactions.*\n","slug":"unstake-all-steth-from-lido","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0x6244c343f3481c0b6346dd41f6813c5b8f50f7adc0d32431acfefeca88e5b047","reason":"markdown"},{"blockNumber":18299257,"blockHash":"0x93060aedf3382c42bee6a960d30bd20a849e9cd6e4a91812f3961155a7b35c6b","transactionIndex":86,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0x0674c2f5c7ad5db98e5d39917e7c72b671166de51baea79748c8dcde2369df5f","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0x1Ae6AD6a1ff47Dfc9A9325Eef17f3745D8fAcEF2","targets":["0x1Ae6AD6a1ff47Dfc9A9325Eef17f3745D8fAcEF2"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"description":"# ATENEA.WTF: Shape Your Own Governance Experience\n\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://imgur.com/4AnGzI5.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-JEJEgziK4)\n\nPresenting Atenea:\n- [Presenting Atenea: The simplified client creation platform.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-JEJEgziK4)\n- [Try Atenea](https://www.atenea.wtf/)\n\n### What is Atenea?\n\n#### Atenea.wtf is the go-to customizable governance client for Nouns DAO members. It adapts to the evolving narrative of community-led efforts within Nouns DAO, offering a dynamic platform for Noun holders to personalize their governance journey.\n\n### Why Atenea?\n\n#### Atenea is more than a governance client—it's a canvas for Nouners to craft their governance masterpiece. It's about turning governance from a duty into an experience. **Shape your governance. Shape your world. Make it Nounish.**\n\n### Our Journey for the Past 4 Months\n\nSome months back, navigating on-chain proposals seemed complex. We saw each DAO member needing a unique solution due to the decentralized and varied nature of our system. So, we aimed for a solution offering freedom—a system to explore governance without limits. With a clear vision, we began to color our sketch.\n\n- #### **Fun and Creativity**:  We built a widget system for customization. Like a canvas to an artist, Atenea aims to spark curiosity in Nouns governance.\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/DmjZzRy.gif)\n- #### **Agility**: We designed all elements to be flexible and self-adjustable, aiming for a smooth user experience.\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YNy0RUK.gif)\n- ####  **Informative**: We created a database to include all necessary information for a Nouner, avoiding the loss of crucial data. Atenea, named after a Greek goddess symbolizing wisdom, reflects our mission for an informed community.\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KRNkiR2.gif)\n- #### **Useful and Analytical**: Atenea aims to provide insights from social to economic aspects within DAO, all easily accessible, valuing Nouners' time while enhancing their experience.\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/orIQS8t.gif)\n----\n\n## Current Widgets from Atenea\n\n\nWe have spent most of our time building the structure of the Atenea, live saving, sharable clients, remix clients, accounts, etc. Even so, we have created 15 widgets with which you can explore governance starting today:\n\n- **4 in one**\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/i6lO4D9.gif)\n- **Active Props**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/NvHMR5v.gif)\n- **By Category**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/AakYkyH.gif)\n- **Executed Props**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/D4sVVrt.gif)\n- **Noun of the day**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/6duG6XM.gif)\n- **Nouners Feedback**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/MZmLHRh.gif)\n- **Roadmap**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/RKW4g8v.gif)\n- **Stats**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/UVMBY1s.gif)\n- **Funded Teams**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/f8rgbLu.gif)\n- **Teams Props**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/WMSgEI6.gif)\n- **Treasury**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/UocWFlT.gif)\n\n\t   \n\n### What Makes Atenea Unique?\n\nThe 'network effect' within Nouns is special—it’s about many joining forces for something larger. We envisioned an open system where any coder could create widgets, with imagination being the only limit. This collective effort will birth something unique.\n\nAtenea removes the entry barriers to client development to make Nouns governance more exciting. Choose which part of the governance you want to improve and we will make it as easy as possible for you.\n\n### ROADMAP \n\n#### **High-Priority**\n\nRoll out features like bidding, making proposals, candidate function, assimilating updates.wtf, and proposal voting.\n\n- Integration of external data sources, such as updates.wtf, would \t\t   require the development of API connectors or data import tools. This ensures that Atenea keeps up to date with information from these data sources.\n\n- Implementing interaction with smart contracts would involve creating and designing the user experience (UX) for interacting with them, with a strong focus on maximum security.\n\n- The proposal creation system is currently our top priority. It allows users to create proposals directly from Atenea, including all necessary data such as category, budget, roadmap or team, all accessible through Atenea widgets. In addition, all the information in these proposals would be accessible through the API for anyone to use.\n\n#### **Mid-Priority**\n\n- Optimize data processing and improve the open-source widget creation system.\n\n- Atenea will only make sense if it works in public, so articles (for propdates) will be made announcing the progress (2 times a month) and a monthly video talking about the most important aspects in which progress has been made in the period.\n\n----\n\n## TEAM\n\n### Josep: Product, UI and Community.\n\nI'm a senior student majoring in mathematics and business with a strong passion for product development.

Noun's Bidet Revolution!** \n\n# Summary \n\nWith a $34,000 proposal, MakeWater aims to shift U.S. bathroom culture by promoting bidets, a net positive for the environment and households. Bidets can slash toilet paper costs, boost hygiene, and ease water infrastructure stress. Our pilot will provide Nouns-branded bidets to low-to-middle-income families, complete with DIY installation videos. \nThe initiative involves an educational drive where students, acting as citizen scientists, gather and share data on bidet usage and delve into water issues in their region. This hands-on approach also includes field trips to local water facilities, providing them with a comprehensive understanding of bidet advantages. By partnering with water utilities and local governments, we envision a self-sustaining model, continually championing bidet use. \nAdditionally, in collaboration with our partner Endaoment, we're running a fundraiser. Contributors providing over 0.05 ETH will receive a **Limited Edition Golden Nouns Bidet ⌐◨-◨** as a token of our appreciation. For those wishing to participate, please donate at [https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592](https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592). \nAs this initiative grabs headlines, Nouns will stand out as the pioneering force behind it. Your support will be the kickstart we need!\n\n**Update** We’ve updated the proposal after listening to feedback and reduced the initial ask, explained our goal for a self-sustained program (no future nouns funding required), and highlighted how Nouns will be seen as the hero catalyzing this revolutionary change in bathroom culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How will it work?\n[![Screen Shot 2023-09-20 at 10.20.35 AM|690x388](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/original/1X/64fdc44ca71b4895023689cf724500b0b393e1b8.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o)\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o)\n\nOur  journey will start with our pilot program in South Texas which will be a pivotal step for data collection, refining strategies, and pinpointing best practices. We are delighted to have already gained the enthusiastic support and active engagement of local utilities and educators,  who will propel the growth of our community and our vision.\nThrough our ongoing community-building efforts, we will strive to gather a strong initial group of participants in South Texas, our pilot region. Far from being just beneficiaries, these participants will become pioneers, actively contributing to data collection and shaping a communal narrative through social media engagement. These authentic stories, personal experiences and testimonials,  will initiate a cultural shift towards bidet use and create a united front against water wastage.\nThe Nouns DAO can kickstart this effort, providing the initial push needed to get the ball rolling. But this isn't just a one-time splash; it's a tide of transformation! The real heart of this initiative is its ability to keep going on its own. Our goal is more than just handing out affordable bidets; it's about making a lasting change in how people use bathrooms in America.\nThis initiative will be a wave of change that keeps building and reaching farther. Our pilot program marks the first splash, but together, we have the power to reshape perspectives, enhance water sustainability, and fundamentally revolutionize water habits across the United States.\n\n\n\n# Why Bidets?\nEnter the humble toilet-mounted bidet — a nifty contraption that adds a touch of luxury to your bathroom routine. It replaces or fits beneath the toilet seat and uses a a nozzle to spray water for cleansing. Its installation is easy and doesn't demand a plumbing professional. Many models even showcase features like adjustable pressure, temperature control, and self-cleaning. Beyond all that, however, lies an ecological marvel— a cost-effective solution that promotes better hygiene while reducing toilet paper waste.\n\nBidets have garnered worldwide recognition for their remarkable water-saving abilities and paper-reducing magic. Embracing bidets translates to preserving trees, conserving water, and reducing the energy dedicated to manufacturing and transporting toilet paper.\n\nTheir appeal isn't just environmental; it's also rooted in hygiene. Bidets offer hands-free, pristine cleanliness, an invaluable health advantage, especially in a time when global health awareness is at its peak.\n\nOur aging water infrastructure poses yet another challenge. Sewage systems of many cities groan under the weight of non-degradable items. These infrastructures were designed for a different era, and non-degradable products like wet wipes weren't part of the plan. Despite their convenience, wipes don't break down in water like toilet paper does. This leads to stubborn blockages, damages to equipment, and ultimately, significant repair costs that households and communities have to bear.\n\nBidets, however, offer a sustainable lifeboat. By adopting bidets, we curtail clogs and damages, sparing households and cities from hefty repair costs. It's not just a bathroom upgrade; it's a blueprint for economic resilience, environmental harmony, and public health.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Our Background\n[![Screen Shot 2023-09-20 at 10.20.35 AM|690x388](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/original/1X/4d1175bec0882ed790ebee5f64ef9998d4ab6125.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE)\n[Video of our Lil Nouns Water Purification Kits built in partnership with the Light House for the Blind Nonprofit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE)\n![79685689a8627fcb69f5c7a138529474869a119a_2_1034x748|690x499](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/optimized/1X/79685689a8627fcb69f5c7a138529474869a119a_2_1034x748.jpeg)\nLil Nouns Kits at our Black Girls Code Event in Houston. \n\n![|217x384](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/S_Kp1aNv2LHDB43Vd7I0bRW3nyPCIiP2lVjTWbgxXiDGTn70Y_I0Se93u0w_tHlnoWD1LzBKB4_w7iqBBz-8_Ogbj9kYiRXvt1rOCAVEyVv9r_UjpoFAu0OBOYZCEgScAS1bb44qldiFXtw4YtwVXWI)\n\n*View MakeWater Endaoment Donation History https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592\n* In June 2022, Lil Nouns passed our 3,000 nouns kits for students proposal by a resounding 211 to 4 vote (➡️see [here](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/16)).\n* We teamed up with Lighthouse for the Blind to create these kits, and we marked our partnership with a video (➡️watch it[ here](https://youtu.be/0thwr7QItyE)).\n* Our victory streak continued with a win at the FoodNouns Prop, where our proposal to create video vignette for our water education curriculum (click to watch our video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYrK_6Y_qUU), ➡️and check out our [tweet](https://twitter.com/makewaterorg/status/1659299148066177024?s=20)) garnered unanimous support (➡️see our %100 positive votes in [here](https://www.foodnouns.wtf/vote/3)).\n* We’ve also received a positive response Lil Nouns PropHouse (Open Round 12) for our proposal asking Lil Nouns to be a 3D printer prize sponsor for World Water Day youth competition (➡️see [here](https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-12-open/3649)).\n* Nounish Team also highlighted our work on World Water Day, with a reel showcasing our work and our ongoing partnership with the community (➡️see [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/4rzK2iCFoWA?feature=share)).\n* Beyond our cherished Nouns community, our network encompasses educators, water utilities, and beyond.

Because food has not been treated as a public good, **over 1.1 billion people globally, including ~10% of the U.S., are food insecure;** meaning they have limited access to stores that offer a variety of healthy and affordable food. This creates severe challenges:\n### Public Health\n- **Stunted Childhoods and Learning Disorders**: \"Longitudinal studies in Canada indicate that hunger is related to poor health outcomes, including a higher risk of depression and suicidal ideation in adolescents, and chronic conditions, particularly asthma. In addition, nutrient deficiencies, such as iron deficiency, are known to impair learning and cause decreased productivity in school-age children, and maternal depressive disorders.\" - [Food insecurity and hunger: A review of the effects on children’s health and behaviour](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4373582/)\n- **Cardiovascular Disease**: A study published in [the Journal of the American Heart Association](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.119.014629) included more than 27,000 adults surveyed from 1999 to 2014. Researchers found more cardiovascular disease and higher overall death rates among those reporting food insecurity.\n- **Obesity**: \"Highly energy-dense processed foods that are high in saturated fats, sugars, and sodium are consumed more often than micronutrient-dense quality foods. Energy-dense foods may help meet daily caloric requirements, but essential nutrients are missing. Therefore, in many countries, undernutrition and obesity coexist and both can be consequences of food insecurity.\" - [Food insecurity as a risk factor for obesity: A review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9549066/)\n### Economic Opportunity\nIndividuals who live in low-income, low-access neighborhoods tend to deal with employment challenges. This is often due to a lack of economic opportunity in their neigborhood, a lack of positive role models, and interactions with the criminal justice system.\n### Global Supply Chains\nIn the United States, processed foods travel an average of 1,300 miles (~2,100 KM), and fresh produce travels an average of 1,500  miles (~2,400 KM) to get to your local grocery store. - [Food Miles: Background and Marketing](https://attra.ncat.org/publication/food-miles-background-and-marketing/#:~:text=The%20Leopold%20Center%20found%20that,traveled%20amounted%20to%201%2C518%20miles.)\n\nThe United Nation's [2021 State of Food and Agriculture report](https://www.fao.org/3/cb4476en/online/cb4476en.html) states that in over 45 nations, the closure of a single route could increase food travel times by 20%+\n\n---\n\n## 💡 **Proposed Solution**\n🌐 [*https://thecityfarmers.org/*](https://thecityfarmers.org/)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Skh4ws0x6.png)\n\n\n📝 *This is what we're building towards, the 10-year vision.\nVertical farming in solar glass greenhouses.* \n\n**The City Farmers** is the premier program of the Kenwood Training Center, a 501c3 non-profit headquartered in Chicago.\n\nWe are dedicated to empowering individuals, particularly those with criminal records and veterans, through comprehensive training in sustainable urban agriculture.

Furthermore, I wish to extend mine hand in assistance, particularly in matters of design, being the possessor of Noun 35 (initially pondering delegation, but the path appeared labyrinthine).\n\nAs the venerable Uncle Ben once spoke, \"With great power comes great responsibility,\" and I hold in high esteem the ethos of donning the Noggles. Servitude to a morally sound objective larger than oneself in a collective pursuit of a better world. From a distance, I have been an observer and contributor for some time, and in this year, I have grown more entwined with the Lil Nouns DAO. \n\nRevelling in the craft of bootlegging, the creation and collection of memes, the design of interactive experiences, and the exploration of far-off lands, I have trod upon five continents over the last decade, practicing the arts of the corporeal and the digital. Presently, I dwell in Costa Rica, seeking to establish a cooperative of teachers. In the realm of the United Kingdom, I oversee a cooperative dedicated to matters of morality and protocol development (EVM) since 2019: [mutuals.fca.org.uk](https://mutuals.fca.org.uk/Search/Society/30459). On the first day of the year 2022, we unveiled an [open-source protocol](https://github.com/borgs-app/borgs/blob/main/README.md) including Noggles as a trait, though, alas, they were made exceedingly scarce, and only a couple have been minted thus far... (;◨_◨) [The first](https://borgs.app/borgs/1778) and [the second](https://borgs.app/borgs/2145), both possess a somewhat peculiar visage.\n\nAs my moniker implies, I go by the name of pipe, so becoming Noun 35 would be most agreeable. I plan to remain active in the governance of Nounish matters on the blockchain and in the realm of Nounposting via social media. Presently, my comrades are the Lil Nouns, for I believe therein lies my current greatest contribution in fostering talent development.

This can be a huge Droposal event that onboards many new Nouns players via a fun, yet meaningful, open edition that others can build upon.\n\n## HOW\nAnyone can mint a Character on an infinite open edition. Each Character can hold Traits (NFTs) - noggles, heads, etc… They can then equip those traits and the character will reflect them visually onchain.\n\nThe distribution of the NFT traits will happen via a 3-day open edition on a standalone site, where users can mint every trait, and build their Noun.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyADfWkZT.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJpOz-kbp.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1hFfWyW6.png)\n\n## TECH\nEverything will be deployed on Base for low gas fees. The DAO will be the owner of the contracts and will be able to add new traits in the future via Droposals. If there is any centralization needed, we will come back to the DAO to make decisions.\n\nCharacter / Noun / TBA :\n-   [Loot2 Example](https://basescan.org/token/0xadbc7ec633b78dc4407215d56eb0861dd7c51431)\n-   A separate contract that can hold any number of traits (3 heads, 0 shirts, 1 background, etc..), and can then be equipped or unequipped\n-   Comes with 0 traits\n \nTraits / NFTs :\n-   [Loot2 Example](https://basescan.org/token/0xb7d488da393b4f34813dabeb295931a2b86ea505#code)\n-   Traits will all be sold in a 3-day open edition, where users can pick which traits to mint, as many of each as they want\n-   New traits can be added to the contracts via DAO Proposals (community submissions or noundry creations for example)\n-   Start with all the traits currently in the DAO.\n\n## DETAILS\nWe aim to have the project completed by the end of November.\n\nThe target for mint fee / price is similar to Zora's - 0.001 ETH, or ~$1.

Because food has not been treated as a public good, **over 1.1 billion people globally, including ~10% of the U.S., are food insecure;** meaning they have limited access to stores that offer a variety of healthy and affordable food. This creates severe challenges:\n### Public Health\n- **Stunted Childhoods and Learning Disorders**: \"Longitudinal studies in Canada indicate that hunger is related to poor health outcomes, including a higher risk of depression and suicidal ideation in adolescents, and chronic conditions, particularly asthma. In addition, nutrient deficiencies, such as iron deficiency, are known to impair learning and cause decreased productivity in school-age children, and maternal depressive disorders.\" - [Food insecurity and hunger: A review of the effects on children’s health and behaviour](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4373582/)\n- **Cardiovascular Disease**: A study published in [the Journal of the American Heart Association](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.119.014629) included more than 27,000 adults surveyed from 1999 to 2014. Researchers found more cardiovascular disease and higher overall death rates among those reporting food insecurity.\n- **Obesity**: \"Highly energy-dense processed foods that are high in saturated fats, sugars, and sodium are consumed more often than micronutrient-dense quality foods. Energy-dense foods may help meet daily caloric requirements, but essential nutrients are missing. Therefore, in many countries, undernutrition and obesity coexist and both can be consequences of food insecurity.\" - [Food insecurity as a risk factor for obesity: A review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9549066/)\n### Economic Opportunity\nIndividuals who live in low-income, low-access neighborhoods tend to deal with employment challenges. This is often due to a lack of economic opportunity in their neigborhood, a lack of positive role models, and interactions with the criminal justice system.\n### Global Supply Chains\nIn the United States, processed foods travel an average of 1,300 miles (~2,100 KM), and fresh produce travels an average of 1,500  miles (~2,400 KM) to get to your local grocery store. - [Food Miles: Background and Marketing](https://attra.ncat.org/publication/food-miles-background-and-marketing/#:~:text=The%20Leopold%20Center%20found%20that,traveled%20amounted%20to%201%2C518%20miles.)\n\nThe United Nation's [2021 State of Food and Agriculture report](https://www.fao.org/3/cb4476en/online/cb4476en.html) states that in over 45 nations, the closure of a single route could increase food travel times by 20%+\n\n---\n\n## 💡 **Proposed Solution**\n🌐 [*https://thecityfarmers.org/*](https://thecityfarmers.org/)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Skh4ws0x6.png)\n\n\n📝 *This is what we're building towards, the 10-year vision.\nVertical farming in solar glass greenhouses.* \n\n**** is the premier program of the Kenwood Training Center, a 501c3 non-profit headquartered in Chicago.\n\nWe are dedicated to empowering individuals, particularly those with criminal records and veterans, through comprehensive training in sustainable urban agriculture.

Access to fresh, nutritionally rich foods is a key determinent of long term mental health and physical wellness. By reframing food as a public good, we have the potential to uplift the whole of society and proliferate the meme through the direct route to people's hearts: their stomachs.\n\n### **Research & Develop Urban Agriculture** \nKobe University's Graduate School of Agricultural Science in Japan has researched dry-fog aeroponics since 2011. When growing lettuce, this method uses 90-95% less water and 98% less land than traditional agriculture. We can build upon this research to include new crops and refine the method, in partnership with the [Illinois Institute of Technology's Institute of Food Safety & Health](https://www.ifsh.iit.edu/) and the United States Department of Agriculture, who are opening their first ever Urban Ag office in Chicago towards the end of this year and have $9 million of grants we qualify for.\n### **Bring Ag Carbon Onchain** \nWe're in conversation with developers focused on omnichain & web2 interopability to bring [agricultrual carbon data](https://cid-inc.com/plant-science-tools/leaf-area-measurement/ci-340-handheld-photosynthesis-system/) onchain. There are millions of dollars of government and private grants available for this R&D work.\n### **Food as Medicine**\nPublic health agencies and providers are increasingly recognizing the role of food and nutrition in health outcomes. The Public Health Institute of Metropolitan Chicago has partnered with us and manages our finances. Their deep connections in the pubic health field place us in a strong position to secure grants for this work. \n### **Workforce Development** \nPHIMC also has deep connections with the Illinois Department of Justice and a commitment to restorative justice programs.

During the process, Yitong will serve as liaison between The Line and the Nouns community to make sure we have the chance to provide feedback during each phase of production.\n\nw/c 19th Oct - Proposal approved (PAYMENT MILESTONE 1 50%)\nw/c 26th Oct - Creative Phase commences\nw/c 10th Nov - Creative Phase Deck Approval\nw/c 16 Nov - Pre-production commences\nw/c 30th Nov - Edit Lock & Designs approval\nw/c 21th Dec - Layout approve\nw/c 21th Dec - Production commences\nw/c 25 Dec - Christmas Break\nw/c 25th Jan - Animation approve\nw/c 25th Feb - Comp approved\nw/c 22 Feb - Final Delivery (PAYMENT MILESTONE 2 50%)\n\n\n## A story in chapters\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryKSTlTeT.png)\nIf we're successful with this first film, we can serialize this into a series of short animations celebrating major Ethereum milestones so that we can both create an ongoing source of funding for Protocol Guild, and tell an episodic story that builds into a larger narrative and universe that can stand on its own and be appealing to a mass audience who might not even know about Nouns or Ethereum.\n","slug":"lets-make-a-short-animated-film-to-fund-the-protocol-guild","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0xdc658257f485698e5197b0316f0be8dcc69e44ddaaeb36e38726fc1ec22f4896","reason":""},{"blockNumber":18324574,"blockHash":"0x598f45b1cfdfd4c4a9b556d326ca2fe4c426f35dd0e0b6dd771ac699b417bb94","transactionIndex":116,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0xe9b45526a79c0288117f1e873c9630795e565db76b50a010c678eecec4752cdb","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0x7f64C6e6908DE72221A06A06b4a02A6546a4d6d2","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)",""],"calldatas":["0x00000000000000000000000058947f539f1c1e930c2aea6e8a9fb0ecc976335700000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000105ef39b200","0x"],"description":"# [Placeholder] Nouns : A Movie - Chapter 3, 4 & 5! ⌐◨-◨\n\n# \n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1zK1hgNV/blunts-announcement.png)\n\n*[Nouns Movie](https://nouns.movie/) Episode 2 with runtime of 11 mins is scheduled to be released in the week of Nov 8-15, 2023.

With contracts built by Wilson, Propdates is the best way to keep up with Nouns proposals after they pass, and an entirely new design space within the greater Nouns ecosystem. We’ve never had any consistent, onchain way to keep track of contributors’ work, and no way to recommend regular updates. Down the line, one could imagine Propdates as an onchain oracle for proposal progress.\n\n## PROGRESS SO FAR\nI built the Propdates site and public graph, inspired by Krel’s [requests.wtf](http://requests.wtf). What started as a weekend experiment has grown into something much bigger: it’s clear that we’ve tapped into something special. In fact, Propdates has already become part of the pre-proposal conversation process - it is expected that a proposer regularly updates the DAO on their work. In just a few weeks, we already have had 17 unique posters, and more coming.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/mt9nCgz/metrics.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/CzXyQrg/other.png)\n\n## LOOKING AHEAD\nWe’d like to move Propdates from an experiment to a fully-featured Nouns app and a key part of the ecosystem, on par with teams like Agora, Federation, Prop House. Our end goal is for Propdates to be a protocol any contract or app can plug into to determine a proposal’s success. It is clear that it could expand further than just Nouns.\n\nWe are asking for three months of funding (more on the team below). Martin will be close to full-time, but working on other projects as well (similar to almost all software proposers). We expect Onion to be part time for two months or so. For these months, our priorities will be:\n1.  Contract improvements to expand functionality  & data\n\t- New channels to post updates in: prop house entries, user channels, custom channels\n\t- Revamped admin system / permissions + “Super Admin” to unlock proposals where proposer is unresponsive\n\t- Explore contract to update/revoke streams based on a proposal's updates\n2.  Improved editor, claiming and submitting UX\n\t- Easy image upload via Arweave or IPFS (and potentially expand as a public good for Nouns ecosystem)\n\t- In-app markdown editor and previews for better UX\n3.  Farcaster integration for likes & comments on updates\n4.  Open Editions to celebrate Completed Props\n\nOur goals by January 31st, 2024 are:\n-   150 proposals marked as completed\n-   400 updates posted\n-   30 weekly updates on average\n\nAdditionally, we want to encourage past proposals to share updates on their work, but recognize it’s often hard for contributors to track down their sponsoring proposers (pre-v3). We are requesting 0.05 ETH to send to each of the first 100 successful props (before prop #363) that posts a non-trivial update as an incentive to kickstart the protocol. At the time of writing there have been 225 successful proposals, so this would go a long way to getting all proposals marked as completed.\n\n## TEAM\n\n-   [martin](https://twitter.com/anquetil) worked on [Mogu](http://nouns.wtf/vote/321), [Explorer Grants](http://nouns.wtf/vote/178), [Hack Week](http://nouns.wtf/vote/253)\n-   [onnnnnnnion](https://twitter.com/onnnnnnnion) (solidity) worked on [BLOCKS](https://mint.fun/zora/0x1F781d47cD59257D7AA1Bd7b2fbaB50D57AF8587), [onions renderer](https://twitter.com/onnnnnnnion/status/1639045062595170307), [PH Infinite Round Committee](https://prop.house/infinite/nouns-retro-grants)\n\n## FUNDING\n-   Team: 30 ETH for three months (via Stream)\n-   Incentives: 5 ETH (100 * 0.05 ETH)\n-   OpEx: 2 ETH\n \nWe commit to posting updates on [updates.wtf](https://updates.wtf) bi-weekly to keep the community updated on our progress.

Because food has not been treated as a public good, **over 1.1 billion people globally, including ~10% of the U.S., are food insecure;** meaning they have limited access to stores that offer a variety of healthy and affordable food. This creates severe challenges:\n### Public Health\n- **Stunted Childhoods and Learning Disorders**: \"Longitudinal studies in Canada indicate that hunger is related to poor health outcomes, including a higher risk of depression and suicidal ideation in adolescents, and chronic conditions, particularly asthma. In addition, nutrient deficiencies, such as iron deficiency, are known to impair learning and cause decreased productivity in school-age children, and maternal depressive disorders.\" - [Food insecurity and hunger: A review of the effects on children’s health and behaviour](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4373582/)\n- **Cardiovascular Disease**: A study published in [the Journal of the American Heart Association](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.119.014629) included more than 27,000 adults surveyed from 1999 to 2014. Researchers found more cardiovascular disease and higher overall death rates among those reporting food insecurity.\n- **Obesity**: \"Highly energy-dense processed foods that are high in saturated fats, sugars, and sodium are consumed more often than micronutrient-dense quality foods. Energy-dense foods may help meet daily caloric requirements, but essential nutrients are missing. Therefore, in many countries, undernutrition and obesity coexist and both can be consequences of food insecurity.\" - [Food insecurity as a risk factor for obesity: A review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9549066/)\n### Economic Opportunity\n- Individuals who live in low-income, low-access neighborhoods tend to deal with employment challenges. This is often due to a lack of economic opportunity in their neigborhood, a lack of positive role models, and interactions with the criminal justice system.\n### Global Supply Chains\n- In the United States, processed foods travel an average of 1,300 miles (~2,100 KM), and fresh produce travels an average of 1,500  miles (~2,400 KM) to get to your local grocery store. - [Food Miles: Background and Marketing](https://attra.ncat.org/publication/food-miles-background-and-marketing/#:~:text=The%20Leopold%20Center%20found%20that,traveled%20amounted%20to%201%2C518%20miles.)\n\n- The United Nation's [2021 State of Food and Agriculture report](https://www.fao.org/3/cb4476en/online/cb4476en.html) states that in over 45 nations, the closure of a single route could increase food travel times by 20%+\n\n---\n\n## 💡 **Proposed Solution**\n🌐 [*https://thecityfarmers.org/*](https://thecityfarmers.org/)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Skh4ws0x6.png)\n\n\n📝 *This is what we're building towards, the 10-year vision.\nVertical farming in solar glass greenhouses.* \n\n**** is the premier program of the Kenwood Training Center, a 501c3 non-profit headquartered in Chicago.\n\nWe are dedicated to empowering individuals, particularly those with criminal records and veterans, through comprehensive training in sustainable urban agriculture.

Noun's Bidet Revolution!** \n# TLDR\nMakeWater is seeking $34,000 USDC to provide low-income families with Nouns-branded bidets, educate the community on their benefits, and produce high-quality video content showcasing the initiative.\n\n# Summary \n\nWith a $34,000 proposal, MakeWater aims to shift U.S. bathroom culture by promoting bidets, a net positive for the environment and households. Bidets can slash toilet paper costs, boost hygiene, and ease water infrastructure stress. Our pilot will provide Nouns-branded bidets to low-to-middle-income families, complete with DIY installation videos. \nThe initiative involves an educational drive where students, acting as citizen scientists, gather and share data on bidet usage and delve into water issues in their region. This hands-on approach also includes field trips to local water facilities, providing them with a comprehensive understanding of bidet advantages. By partnering with water utilities and local governments, we envision a self-sustaining model, continually championing bidet use. \nAs this initiative grabs headlines, Nouns will stand out as the pioneering force behind it. Your support will be the kickstart we need!\n\n**Update** We’ve updated the proposal after listening to feedback and reduced the initial ask, explained our goal for a self-sustained program (no future nouns funding required), and highlighted how Nouns will be seen as the hero catalyzing this revolutionary change in bathroom culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How will it work?\n[![Screen Shot 2023-09-20 at 10.20.35 AM|690x388](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/original/1X/64fdc44ca71b4895023689cf724500b0b393e1b8.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o)\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o)\n\nOur  journey will start with our pilot program in South Texas which will be a pivotal step for data collection, refining strategies, and pinpointing best practices. We are delighted to have already gained the enthusiastic support and active engagement of local utilities and educators,  who will propel the growth of our community and our vision.\nThrough our ongoing community-building efforts, we will strive to gather a strong initial group of participants in South Texas, our pilot region. Far from being just beneficiaries, these participants will become pioneers, actively contributing to data collection and shaping a communal narrative through social media engagement. These authentic stories, personal experiences and testimonials,  will initiate a cultural shift towards bidet use and create a united front against water wastage.\nThe Nouns DAO can kickstart this effort, providing the initial push needed to get the ball rolling. But this isn't just a one-time splash; it's a tide of transformation! The real heart of this initiative is its ability to keep going on its own. Our goal is more than just handing out affordable bidets; it's about making a lasting change in how people use bathrooms in America.\nThis initiative will be a wave of change that keeps building and reaching farther. Our pilot program marks the first splash, but together, we have the power to reshape perspectives, enhance water sustainability, and fundamentally revolutionize water habits across the United States.\n\n**Want a Limited Edition Golden Nouns Bidet ⌐◨-◨?** \nDonate 0.05 ETH or more at  [https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592](https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592).\nAll contributions further our mission, and as a token of our appreciation, you'll receive the exclusive bidet.\n\n\n# Why Bidets?\nEnter the humble toilet-mounted bidet — a nifty contraption that adds a touch of luxury to your bathroom routine. It replaces or fits beneath the toilet seat and uses a a nozzle to spray water for cleansing. Its installation is easy and doesn't demand a plumbing professional. Many models even showcase features like adjustable pressure, temperature control, and self-cleaning. Beyond all that, however, lies an ecological marvel— a cost-effective solution that promotes better hygiene while reducing toilet paper waste.\n\nBidets have garnered worldwide recognition for their remarkable water-saving abilities and paper-reducing magic. Embracing bidets translates to preserving trees, conserving water, and reducing the energy dedicated to manufacturing and transporting toilet paper.\n\nTheir appeal isn't just environmental; it's also rooted in hygiene. Bidets offer hands-free, pristine cleanliness, an invaluable health advantage, especially in a time when global health awareness is at its peak.\n\nOur aging water infrastructure poses yet another challenge. Sewage systems of many cities groan under the weight of non-degradable items. These infrastructures were designed for a different era, and non-degradable products like wet wipes weren't part of the plan. Despite their convenience, wipes don't break down in water like toilet paper does. This leads to stubborn blockages, damages to equipment, and ultimately, significant repair costs that households and communities have to bear.\n\nBidets, however, offer a sustainable lifeboat. By adopting bidets, we curtail clogs and damages, sparing households and cities from hefty repair costs.

Noun's Bidet Revolution!** \n# TLDR\nMakeWater is seeking $34,000 USDC to provide low-income families with Nouns-branded bidets, educate the community on their benefits, and produce high-quality video content showcasing the initiative.\n\n# Summary \n\nWith a $34,000 proposal, MakeWater aims to shift U.S. bathroom culture by promoting bidets, a net positive for the environment and households. Bidets can slash toilet paper costs, boost hygiene, and ease water infrastructure stress. Our pilot will provide Nouns-branded bidets to low-to-middle-income families, complete with DIY installation videos. \nThe initiative involves an educational drive where students, acting as citizen scientists, gather and share data on bidet usage and delve into water issues in their region. This hands-on approach also includes field trips to local water facilities, providing them with a comprehensive understanding of bidet advantages. By partnering with water utilities and local governments, we envision a self-sustaining model, continually championing bidet use. \nAs this initiative grabs headlines, Nouns will stand out as the pioneering force behind it. Your support will be the kickstart we need!\n\n**Update** We’ve updated the proposal after listening to feedback and reduced the initial ask, explained our goal for a self-sustained program (no future nouns funding required), and highlighted how Nouns will be seen as the hero catalyzing this revolutionary change in bathroom culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How will it work?\n[![Screen Shot 2023-09-20 at 10.20.35 AM|690x388](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/original/1X/64fdc44ca71b4895023689cf724500b0b393e1b8.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o)\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o)\n\nOur  journey will start with our pilot program in South Texas which will be a pivotal step for data collection, refining strategies, and pinpointing best practices. We are delighted to have already gained the enthusiastic support and active engagement of local utilities and educators,  who will propel the growth of our community and our vision.\nThrough our ongoing community-building efforts, we will strive to gather a strong initial group of participants in South Texas, our pilot region. Far from being just beneficiaries, these participants will become pioneers, actively contributing to data collection and shaping a communal narrative through social media engagement. These authentic stories, personal experiences and testimonials,  will initiate a cultural shift towards bidet use and create a united front against water wastage.\nThe Nouns DAO can kickstart this effort, providing the initial push needed to get the ball rolling. But this isn't just a one-time splash; it's a tide of transformation! The real heart of this initiative is its ability to keep going on its own. Our goal is more than just handing out affordable bidets; it's about making a lasting change in how people use bathrooms in America.\nThis initiative will be a wave of change that keeps building and reaching farther. Our pilot program marks the first splash, but together, we have the power to reshape perspectives, enhance water sustainability, and fundamentally revolutionize water habits across the United States.\n\n**Want a Limited Edition Golden Nouns Bidet ⌐◨-◨?** \nDonate 0.05 ETH or more at  [https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592](https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592).\nAll contributions further our mission, and as a token of our appreciation, you'll receive the exclusive bidet.\n\n\n# Why Bidets?\nEnter the humble toilet-mounted bidet — a nifty contraption that adds a touch of luxury to your bathroom routine. It replaces or fits beneath the toilet seat and uses a a nozzle to spray water for cleansing. Its installation is easy and doesn't demand a plumbing professional. Many models even showcase features like adjustable pressure, temperature control, and self-cleaning. Beyond all that, however, lies an ecological marvel— a cost-effective solution that promotes better hygiene while reducing toilet paper waste.\n\nBidets have garnered worldwide recognition for their remarkable water-saving abilities and paper-reducing magic. Embracing bidets translates to preserving trees, conserving water, and reducing the energy dedicated to manufacturing and transporting toilet paper.\n\nTheir appeal isn't just environmental; it's also rooted in hygiene. Bidets offer hands-free, pristine cleanliness, an invaluable health advantage, especially in a time when global health awareness is at its peak.\n\nOur aging water infrastructure poses yet another challenge. Sewage systems of many cities groan under the weight of non-degradable items. These infrastructures were designed for a different era, and non-degradable products like wet wipes weren't part of the plan. Despite their convenience, wipes don't break down in water like toilet paper does. This leads to stubborn blockages, damages to equipment, and ultimately, significant repair costs that households and communities have to bear.\n\nBidets, however, offer a sustainable lifeboat. By adopting bidets, we curtail clogs and damages, sparing households and cities from hefty repair costs. It's not just a bathroom upgrade; it's a blueprint for economic resilience, environmental harmony, and public health.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Our Background\n[![Screen Shot 2023-09-20 at 10.20.35 AM|690x388](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/original/1X/4d1175bec0882ed790ebee5f64ef9998d4ab6125.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE)\n[Video of our Lil Nouns Water Purification Kits built in partnership with the Light House for the Blind Nonprofit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE)\n![79685689a8627fcb69f5c7a138529474869a119a_2_1034x748|690x499](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/optimized/1X/79685689a8627fcb69f5c7a138529474869a119a_2_1034x748.jpeg)\nLil Nouns Kits at our Black Girls Code Event in Houston. \n\n![|217x384](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/S_Kp1aNv2LHDB43Vd7I0bRW3nyPCIiP2lVjTWbgxXiDGTn70Y_I0Se93u0w_tHlnoWD1LzBKB4_w7iqBBz-8_Ogbj9kYiRXvt1rOCAVEyVv9r_UjpoFAu0OBOYZCEgScAS1bb44qldiFXtw4YtwVXWI)\n\n*View MakeWater Endaoment Donation History https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592\n* In June 2022, Lil Nouns passed our 3,000 nouns kits for students proposal by a resounding 211 to 4 vote (➡️see [here](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/16)).\n* We teamed up with Lighthouse for the Blind to create these kits, and we marked our partnership with a video (➡️watch it[ here](https://youtu.be/0thwr7QItyE)).\n* Our victory streak continued with a win at the FoodNouns Prop, where our proposal to create video vignette for our water education curriculum (click to watch our video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYrK_6Y_qUU), ➡️and check out our [tweet](https://twitter.com/makewaterorg/status/1659299148066177024?s=20)) garnered unanimous support (➡️see our %100 positive votes in [here](https://www.foodnouns.wtf/vote/3)).\n* We’ve also received a positive response Lil Nouns PropHouse (Open Round 12) for our proposal asking Lil Nouns to be a 3D printer prize sponsor for World Water Day youth competition (➡️see [here](https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-12-open/3649)).\n* Nounish Team also highlighted our work on World Water Day, with a reel showcasing our work and our ongoing partnership with the community (➡️see [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/4rzK2iCFoWA?feature=share)).\n* Beyond our cherished Nouns community, our network encompasses educators, water utilities, and beyond.

Because food has not been treated as a public good, **over 1.1 billion people globally, including ~10% of the U.S., are food insecure;** meaning they have limited access to stores that offer a variety of healthy and affordable food. This creates severe challenges:\n### Public Health\n- **Stunted Childhoods and Learning Disorders**: \"Longitudinal studies in Canada indicate that hunger is related to poor health outcomes, including a higher risk of depression and suicidal ideation in adolescents, and chronic conditions, particularly asthma. In addition, nutrient deficiencies, such as iron deficiency, are known to impair learning and cause decreased productivity in school-age children, and maternal depressive disorders.\" - [Food insecurity and hunger: A review of the effects on children’s health and behaviour](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4373582/)\n- **Cardiovascular Disease**: A study published in [the Journal of the American Heart Association](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.119.014629) included more than 27,000 adults surveyed from 1999 to 2014. Researchers found more cardiovascular disease and higher overall death rates among those reporting food insecurity.\n- **Obesity**: \"Highly energy-dense processed foods that are high in saturated fats, sugars, and sodium are consumed more often than micronutrient-dense quality foods. Energy-dense foods may help meet daily caloric requirements, but essential nutrients are missing. Therefore, in many countries, undernutrition and obesity coexist and both can be consequences of food insecurity.\" - [Food insecurity as a risk factor for obesity: A review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9549066/)\n### Economic Opportunity\n- Individuals who live in low-income, low-access neighborhoods tend to deal with employment challenges. This is often due to a lack of economic opportunity in their neigborhood, a lack of positive role models, and interactions with the criminal justice system.\n### Global Supply Chains\n- In the United States, processed foods travel an average of 1,300 miles (~2,100 KM), and fresh produce travels an average of 1,500  miles (~2,400 KM) to get to your local grocery store. - [Food Miles: Background and Marketing](https://attra.ncat.org/publication/food-miles-background-and-marketing/#:~:text=The%20Leopold%20Center%20found%20that,traveled%20amounted%20to%201%2C518%20miles.)\n\n- The United Nation's [2021 State of Food and Agriculture report](https://www.fao.org/3/cb4476en/online/cb4476en.html) states that in over 45 nations, the closure of a single route could increase food travel times by 20%+\n\n---\n\n## 💡 **Proposed Solution**\n🌐 [*https://thecityfarmers.org/*](https://thecityfarmers.org/)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Skh4ws0x6.png)\n\n\n📝 *This is what we're building towards, the 10-year vision.\nVertical farming in solar glass greenhouses.* \n\n**** is the premier program of the Kenwood Training Center, a 501c3 non-profit headquartered in Chicago.\n\nWe are dedicated to empowering individuals, particularly those with criminal records and veterans, through comprehensive training in sustainable urban agriculture.

A USDA staff member with 18 years of tenure recommended wylin apply for their ag innovation board. \n\nWe need to hire someone who actually knows how to put together a federal grant application, which takes an experienced professional 120-200 hours per grant.\n\n### Year 2-4: \nUse the grant money to fund research classes at the Institute of Food Safety and Health in Chicago, as well as the college of architecture and engineering at the same school. wylin has a friend who is a Director for inter-departmental courses and is working with him to make this happen.\n\nThe point is to develop a minimum viable product to deploy in the real world.\n\n### Year 5-7:\nStart building greenhouses in partnership with the City and the Department of Justice to do workforce development training. Our finance manager has deep relationships from past and current projects they’ve sponsored.\n \n### Year 7-10:\nOpen a for-profit that is owned by the non-profit. Use it to scale the business, and start franchising greenhouses to people who have been through the training program.\n\n\n---\n## 🔍 **DYOR**\n\nThis project has been a work in progress for several years.

Therefore, I reconsidered two aspects:\n\nThe amount of ETH will decrease from 10 ETH to 6.5 ETH for the same quantity of GIFs.\n\nThe other point revolved around the other \"nounish\" GIFs. Further down in this proposal, I will detail why GIFs featuring nouns as protagonists are very important and complement those.\n\n**Also onizuka.eth asked About Distribution:**\n\nAll the GIFs will be part of a Giphy collection in an account called 'Nouns GIFs.' Each GIF will include the 'What is Nouns DAO' video as the source. This way, every person who receives the GIF will be able to learn more about that character.\n\nOf course, every piece of creation, including my 3D models, will be  CC0 and shared with the community. This means that in the future, if we want to turn the GIFs into collectible NFTs, we will be able to do so.\n\nEvery GIF will be shared with the Nouns Twitter account manager for distribution to the community.\n\nAll 100 GIFs and files will be stored in a folder accessible to the community at any time.\n\n------------\n\n# Description\n\nI would like to share the proposal I have been working on, as I believe it could greatly benefit the proliferation of our beloved **Nouns**, something we all cherish in this community.\n\nThe proposal I have in mind is **simple** yet **powerful**: I want to create a large number of **2D** and **3D** gifs and stickers featuring Nouns characters. These gifs and stickers will be communicative, humorous and **relatable** with the aim of reaching a wider audience with Nouns characters and encouraging their recurring use.\n\n## Goal\n\nThe goal is to make GIFs that people both inside and outside the world of nouns can use. This way, they'll start incorporating nouns into their **daily lives**. Plus, GIFs are currently one of the most viral forms of content because their primary purpose is to be shared to convey an idea, emotion, or joke.\n\n![alt text](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExd2kycWx5YWR1MTRyeXdhcmRlMzI0ZGI5Z3k2cG1yZGZiNzY5cjBkYSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/MKr18qpDptEKhk6yWp/giphy.gif)\n\n## Pudgy Penguins\n\nA successful case we can take as a reference is  \"Pudgy Penguins\" Gif collection. With just a few months of gif publications, the Pudgies reached many new people and quickly became popular.\n\n![alt text](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYhMxqhWQAMKjfm.jpg)\n\n![alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1244/1*_-RtCt584lViXV8EureZ_A.png)\n\n![alt text](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExcHI2Y2liODd3a3cwbjlvcjRxbzZtZzMxem5yOXIzN2d1ZTljOWc5byZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/7Z6pYYjzYNPyPkS6yb/giphy.gif)\n\nAnother important aspect is that producing gifs is more cost-effective than producing videos, and unlike videos, the gifs we create today can be used indefinitely.\n\n## Nounish Gifs\n\nCurrently, the Nounish team is crafting some  cool GIFs for nouns. It's a clever strategy to enhance familiar images by adding the noggles on top of them. However, most regular folks probably don't know what these \"noggles\" are. That's why these GIFs introduce the characters behind the \"noggles\" brand. These will complement the current ones beautifully!\n\nCharacter GIFs are very useful for a brand because users become more attached to the characters and what they represent with each passing day. Currently, neither the community nor individuals outside it have the opportunity to use small nouns to communicate, as the Pudgy Penguins community does. This proposal aims to address that need.\n\n![alt text](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNm8wZHk1OHBpYzIxaWJvOWd6ZW53MWd4ZnNiMDBhM2t3Z3ZxbGVkcyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/5DKoUvpIwMLPCMpr1v/giphy.gif)\n\n## Team\n\nTo carry out this proposal, I'll be teaming up with my friend and colleague Santiago Pereyra.

This is often due to a lack of economic opportunity in their neigborhood, a lack of positive role models, and interactions with the criminal justice system.\n### Global Supply Chains\n- In the United States, processed foods travel an average of 1,300 miles (~2,100 KM), and fresh produce travels an average of 1,500  miles (~2,400 KM) to get to your local grocery store. - [Food Miles: Background and Marketing](https://attra.ncat.org/publication/food-miles-background-and-marketing/#:~:text=The%20Leopold%20Center%20found%20that,traveled%20amounted%20to%201%2C518%20miles.)\n\n- The United Nation's [2021 State of Food and Agriculture report](https://www.fao.org/3/cb4476en/online/cb4476en.html) states that in over 45 nations, the closure of a single route could increase food travel times by 20%+\n\n---\n\n## 💡 **Proposed Solution**\n🌐 [*https://thecityfarmers.org/*](https://thecityfarmers.org/)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Skh4ws0x6.png)\n\n\n📝 *This is what we're building towards, the 10-year vision.\nVertical farming in solar glass greenhouses.* \n\n**** is the premier program of the Kenwood Training Center, a 501c3 non-profit headquartered in Chicago.\n\nWe are dedicated to empowering individuals, particularly those with criminal records and veterans, through comprehensive training in sustainable urban agriculture.

The USDA is opening their first ever Urban Agriculture office on the West Side of Chicago; a staff member with 18 years of tenure recommended wylin apply for their ag innovation board. \n\nWe need to hire someone who actually knows how to put together a federal grant application, which takes an experienced professional 120-200 hours per grant.\n\n### Year 2-4: \nUse the grant money to fund research classes at the Institute of Food Safety and Health in Chicago, as well as the college of architecture and engineering at the same school. wylin has a friend who is a Director for inter-departmental courses and is working with him to make this happen.\n\nThe point is to develop a minimum viable product to deploy in the real world.\n\n### Year 5-7:\nStart building greenhouses in partnership with the City and the Department of Justice to do workforce development training. Our finance manager has deep relationships from past and current projects they’ve sponsored. We have a pilot location in mind next door to a Juvenile Detention Facility in Chicago.\n \n### Year 7-10:\nOpen a for-profit that is owned by the non-profit.

I am putting this up to raise awareness among voters, stimulate the conversation, and listen to feedback. \n\nI will break this down into two sections: a TL;DR for people with a technical background, and a further breakdown to help the general community understand the issue at hand - why I believe the current proposed burn mechanism specs do not eliminate the intrinsic value arbitrage opportunity, and most importantly what can be done to resolve this! \n\n**TL;DR: I am proposing to change the timeframe that ‘burns’ could potentially occur from 90 days to a fork threshold period of N days.** There are 69 Nouns in Fork 1 - this would bring new circulating supply down to 332 - meaning if all new auction bids are from RFV traders it would take 33 days to trigger a new fork (assuming zero are sold on secondary market below BV). If we keep the proposed 90 days there could be potentially 3+ more rounds of forks before a burn is executed. \n\n**I am proposing that we change from auction average value to the lowest settlement price within the previous N days (which I am calling fork threshold period).** In order to completely remove the intrinsic value arbitrage opportunity we have to set it to zero. This is done by having the lowest auction price within the previous N days set as the new strike price. If the lowest auction price is above book value then default to book value (as BV would be the redemption value if forked & RQ). These parameters would ensure protection for the DAO when auction prices trend below BV. \n\n**I am proposing that we do not build this design into the protocol and first test with a manual solution I have described below.** I believe that once we eliminate the intrinsic value arbitrage opportunity completely, this will no longer be an issue to plague the DAO, therefore there is no need to make protocol changes which are time and cost intensive. \n\n—-----------------------------\n\n**Issue At Hand:** Currently we are faced with an issue that Nouns BV (book value) is higher than the current market demand, therefore creating an intrinsic value arbitrage opportunity to bid in the auction below BV, then Fork & RQ (Rage Quit) a pro rata share of the treasury and capturing a RFV (risk free value) trade. There have been numerous solutions proposed on how to resolve this issue such as burning excess eth, ‘forced spending’, vesting newly minted nouns etc. The issue is, the current proposed solutions do not eliminate the intrinsic value arbitrage opportunity or generate organic market demand for auctions to trade above book value. \n\nBelow I have created a simulation of a Fork Threshold Period that I have set to 40 days, this means it would take 40 days of auctions to mint enough new Nouns to trigger a fork. This includes mock data of potential auction prices and prop spending following current trends of auction prices below book value. \n\n![Simulation 1](https://imageupload.io/ib/XiXuv0duNPiofdo_1697349635.png)\n\n\nFirst we will review this simulation with the current proposed burn structure:\n\n![Current Burn Specs](https://imageupload.io/ib/DvM0rTXmI9JzdIt_1697265039.png)\n\nWith this current proposed burn structure we would have to quickly spend or burn 500.58 eth.\n\n**Why This Solution Does Not Eliminate The Arb Opportunity:** We are using an average vs the lowest auction price, therefore there is incentive for the RFV traders to keep the auction average below BV with a large spread. After fork 0 we saw auction prices range from 16-33. Therefore if we assume in the above simulation that the people who bought below are RFV traders, there would be an additional 720.36eth leaving the treasury in the next fork - of which 51.18eth is RFV (Risk Free Value). At this rate we would still be losing eth to arbitrage trades, and between the ‘burn’ & fork we would see 1220.94 eth leaving the treasury. Rinse and repeat every fork threshold until we have organic market demand where all auction prices are consistently above BV. \n\n—-----------------------------\n\nNext we will review a simulation of my proposed parameters which involves taking the lowest auction price within the last N days (fork threshold). Please note, the first simulation is going to be the most extreme, after this though the arb opportunity is completely closed. This means the actions moving forward of burn, spend or dilute would be much less volatile. \n \n![Proposed Burn Specs](https://imageupload.io/ib/vjRAATPpIQ7smrh_1697265038.png)\n\nFrom this data you can see that we would be taking the lowest auction price of the last N days (fork threshold period) which becomes the new book value price. Ending BV is 32.47 and we would need to reduce this to match the lowest auction price of 25.7…. There are three options on how we can do this: Burn. Spend. Dilute. \n\nBurning will be done via sending eth to: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD spend would send money to Prop House to be used for future funding of props and builders (as an example), dilute would be done by releasing Nouns into a rewards wallet - still controlled by the DAO, but out of the treasury therefore counted towards circulating supply. \n\nFrom the example above the options for this simulation would be to Burn 2945.28 eth, Spend 2945.28 eth by sending it to Prop House for future use, or Dilute by releasing 120 Nouns to a rewards wallet for future distribution. \n\n**What Can Be Done To Resolve This:** I do not believe any of these choices should be made as a default decision built into the protocol. I believe the community should be presented the data from each fork threshold period and be allowed to make an informed decision on which option they would prefer to execute. The eth can be transferred to an escrow contract so it is out of the treasury and not calculated towards BV while the DAO votes to Burn. Spend. Dilute - If dilution is the option voted on by the DAO, the escrowed eth will be returned to the Treasury after Treasury Nouns are transferred to the rewards wallet. This decision should be executed within N days (I propose 7 as that aligns with the current proposal voting period). \n\nI am proposing to create a dashboard that will display the following stats and will also serve as a sentiment voting platform for Nouns token holders: \n\n![Voting Dashboard](https://imageupload.io/ib/LHQ2bhseBWmVvpI_1697314351.png)\n\nDuring the fork threshold period based on the data provided DAO members can come to vote on which option they would like to choose: Burn. Spend. Dilute. This vote will be done via snapshot and at the end of the fork threshold the results will display the vote, and a community member can put an onchain proposal to execute the collective decision. I believe this will increase governance participation - allow community members to feel they have a say in which option is being chosen, and also allow for decision making based on accurate information vs estimations. \n\nAs I mentioned above the first simulation will be the most extreme and volatile. Here is a simulation where auction prices have a tighter window as we trend towards our goal of auction prices = or > BV. \n\n![Simulation 2](https://imageupload.io/ib/w7TIlHPEA7QWnZO_1697349635.png)\n\nFor simulation 2 with my proposed specs we have an ending BV of 15.84 and the lowest auction price of 15.42. This means we would be presented with the options of burning 350.85 eth, spending 350.85 eth or releasing 30 Nouns into the rewards wallet. \n\n![Proposed Burn Specs](https://imageupload.io/ib/9yylEzvvYRaXKcv_1697314351.png)\n\nAs you can see this is less volatile of a situation vs simulation 1. Once the RFV traders know that there is no longer an intrinsic arb opportunity we should see Nouns find its true market value, and only people bidding and buying into the project who have an aligned vision. \n\nAuction prices are unknown and game-able if the arb opportunity is still open. This means that even if the idea of the DAO was to spend down the treasury quickly, there would not be accurate data available to make decisions quick enough (as the final numbers are not calculated ‘until it's too late’). Meaning we will not know the true number to burn, spend or dilute until the final days of the 90 day period, and we currently have a 7 day voting period for proposals to pass or fail. If the RFV traders see large props in the pipeline they will adjust their auction bids based on that information. This will result in a constant cat and mouse game until we generate organic market demand for the auction above book value. \n\n**Disadvantages To Closing Arb Opportunity:** While I personally believe this is the most effective solution to resolve our current issue, I do recognize that there are disadvantages to closing the arb opportunity completely which include the following: \n- **Market Discovery of True Book Value** - This means that we would be faced with volatility during the price discovery phase, are we prepared to see a 12-15 eth Noun during these current market conditions?\n- **Decreased Auction Participation** - Currently ~85% of auction bids are from RFV traders, if the arb opportunity is closed we may see a decrease in auction activity until we generate more organic market demand\n- **Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Arb Opportunity** - The issue we are currently dealing with involves the intrinsic arb opportunity….. If we remove this we will see traders with more advanced financial strategies come into play, which would involve an extrinsic arb opportunity when auction prices = or > BV (there is a resolution to this issue which can be proposed as a phase 2 as the intrinsic arb is taken care of first)\n\nI have ran other simulations with different auction price & prop spending scenarios and can share with anyone interested.

It adapts to the evolving narrative of community-led efforts within Nouns DAO, offering a dynamic platform for Noun holders to personalize their governance journey.\n\n### Why Atenea?\n\n#### Atenea is more than a governance client—it's a canvas for Nouners to craft their governance masterpiece. It's about turning governance from a duty into an experience. **Shape your governance. Shape your world. Make it Nounish.**\n\n### Our Journey for the Past 4 Months\n\nSome months ago, navigating on-chain proposals seemed complex. We saw each DAO member needing a unique solution due to the decentralized and varied nature of our system. So, we aimed for a solution offering freedom—a system to explore governance without limits. With a clear vision, we began to color our sketch.\n\n- #### **Fun and Creativity**:  We built a widget system for customization. Like a canvas to an artist, Atenea aims to spark curiosity in Nouns governance.\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/DmjZzRy.gif)\n- #### **Agility**: We designed all elements to be flexible and self-adjustable, aiming for a smooth user experience.\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YNy0RUK.gif)\n- ####  **Informative**: We created a database to include all necessary information for a Nouner, avoiding the loss of crucial data. Atenea, named after a Greek goddess symbolizing wisdom, reflects our mission for an informed community.\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KRNkiR2.gif)\n- #### **Useful and Analytical**: Atenea aims to provide insights from social to economic aspects within DAO, all easily accessible, valuing Nouners' time while enhancing their experience.\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/orIQS8t.gif)\n----\n\n## Current Widgets from Atenea\n\n\nWe have spent most of our time building the structure of the Atenea, live saving, sharable clients, remix clients, accounts, etc. Even so, we have created 15 widgets with which you can explore governance starting today:\n\n- **Proposal Overview**\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/i6lO4D9.gif)\n- **Active Proposals**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/NvHMR5v.gif)\n- **Proposals Funded by Category**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/AakYkyH.gif)\n- **Executed Proposals**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/D4sVVrt.gif)\n- **Noun of the day**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/6duG6XM.gif)\n- **Nouners Feedback**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/MZmLHRh.gif)\n- **Roadmap**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/RKW4g8v.gif)\n- **Stats**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/UVMBY1s.gif)\n- **Funded Teams**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/f8rgbLu.gif)\n- **Proposal Team**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/WMSgEI6.gif)\n- **Treasury**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/UocWFlT.gif)\n\n\t   \n\n### What Makes Atenea Unique?\n\nThe 'network effect' within Nouns is special—it’s about many joining forces for something larger. We envisioned an open system where any coder could create widgets, with imagination being the only limit. This collective effort will birth something unique.\n\nAtenea removes the entry barriers to client development to make Nouns governance more exciting. Choose which part of the governance you want to improve and, we will make it as easy as possible for you.\n\n### ROADMAP \n\n#### **High-Priority**\n\nRoll out features like bidding, making proposals, candidate functions, assimilating updates.wtf, and proposal voting.\n\n- Integration of external data sources, such as updates.wtf, would require the development of API connectors or data import tools. This ensures that Atenea keeps up to date with information from these data sources. (We have already completed it)\n\n- Implementing interaction with smart contracts would involve creating and designing the user experience (UX) for interacting with them, with a strong focus on maximum security.\n\n- The proposal creation system is currently our top priority. It allows users to create proposals directly from Atenea, including all necessary data such as category, budget, roadmap or team, all accessible through Atenea widgets. In addition, all the information in these proposals would be accessible through the API for anyone to use.\n\n#### **Mid-Priority**\n\n- Optimize data processing and improve the open-source widget creation system.\n\n- Atenea will only make sense if it works in public, so articles (for propdates) will be made announcing the progress (2 times a month) and a monthly video talking about the most important aspects in which progress has been made in the period.\n\n----\n\n## TEAM\n\n### Josep: Product, UI and Community.\n\nI'm a senior student majoring in mathematics and business with a strong passion for product development.

These are fantastic resources for developers and designers, but can be difficult for non-technical audiences to use. We want to bring accessibility and utility of Nouns to **everyone** by providing a simple, seamless way to use Nouns avatars and art across the best digital platforms and spaces. \n\n![nounsIntegrations](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/pineappleMosaic.gif)\n\n## Proposal brief\nWith the Bounce platform, we want to bridge the Nouniverse and the open Metaverse:\n\n- make current and future Nouns easily to use, seamlessly, across digital platforms ⇒ **everyone** can experience and enjoy Nouns, forever\n- bring exposure in more spaces to new audiences, both web3 and web2 ⇒ **grow** Nouns community\n- build and open and extensible system with a Bounce API & SDK ⇒ **empower** community to innovate and build on top of Bounce\n\n## Feedback\n\n**We’re replying to all feedback in a Q&A section at the end of this proposal**\n\n## Budget\n\nWe’re asking for 15 ETH to onboard Nouns onto Bounce and enable cross-world experiences.\nThe budget includes:\n\n- Build a Nouns X Bounce community microsite\n- Cost of asset onboarding and processing all existing and future Nouns for the following platforms:\n    - VRChat\n    - Mona\n    - Snap\n    - Instagram\n- Making Bounce connections free for everyone, across all spaces, forever\n- Developing new platform integrations for spaces the Nouns community is excited about\n\n# Proposal\n\nBounce is a new cross-world digital asset platform that makes it easy for fans and collectors to embody their avatars in immersive web2 and web3 platforms, and connect with their communities. Our goal is to empower avatar communities to embody their avatars, express themselves and come together in more immersive and engaging ways.\n\nThis proposal is to onboard Nouns onto Bounce as an early partner, making Nouns enjoyable by the community across a range of digital spaces, including social, gaming and metaverse platforms\n\n## How Bounce benefits the Nouns community\n\n- Easily enjoy Nouns as avatars, sticker packs, face filters and more across social, gaming and metaverse platforms\n- Expand the community and reach of the Nouns brand and content across digital spaces\n- Access more platforms and experiences as they roll out, new spaces are available to all Nouns, new and existing\n- Support other DAO projects with public API and SDK that make “bouncing” a seamless and hassle-free process\n- Bounce Tags support phygital projects with easy onboarding and allocated stock\n- Nouns on Bounce will be free for everyone, forever\n\n## Deliverables\n\nThe project is estimated at 1.5 to 2 months and will include:\n\n- **A unique Bounce X Nouns microsite** where the community can go to bounce across spaces and enjoy exclusive content. This site also acts as a landing page for special Nouns events and activations across spaces. (EXAMPLE MOCKUP BELOW)\n    \n    ![nounsMicrositeMockup.jpg](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/nounsPage.jpg)\n    \n- **Cross platform digital avatars** that can be used as in-space characters, face lenses and filters, sticker packs and more across a range of platforms.\n    \n    Platforms include:\n    \n  - VR Chat\n    \n    ![VRChat Nouns](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/vrchatGifNouns.gif)\n\n    \n  - Mona\n    \n    ![Mona Nouns](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/monaGif.gif)\n  \n    \n  - AR Filters: (ROUGH PROTOTYPE BELOW)\n    - Snap\n    - Instagram\n    \n    ![AR Filter Nouns](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/social+lenses.gif)\n\n    \n- More spaces the community is excited about\n- **Public API, SDK and docs** that can be used by other DAO projects to give utility to digital assets and make bouncing a hassle free integration.\n- **Free access to everyone, across all spaces, forever**\n\nWe also commit to posting frequent updates on https://www.updates.wtf/ to keep the community informed on progress and updates, both as the proposal is developed, and as future platforms and experiences are rolled out and made available.\n\n# Future proposals\n\n## Bounce X Nouniverse events and community activations\n\nWe think the best way to experience bounce as a community is through special events, gatherings and activations. Our collab with the Wassies community was made so much more exciting by their VR Chat Among Us and Zombie Survival (https://twitter.com/ByWassiesEvents)\n\nAs Nouns is decentralized, we’d like to put forward future proposals to design, plan, coordinate and market events and games across platforms.\n\n## Bounce Tags for DAO and community projects\n\nBounce Tags, our secure chain-linked NFC tags, are integrated into the Bounce ecosystem and make bouncing from a physical collectible to digital spaces a quick and seamless experience. Many DAO proposals are dedicated to crafting both amazing new Nouns physical products (Noggle Changers, NounsDAO x Pudgy Penguins toys, NOUNISH FRIENDS mini-figures, etc), and these could all be linked using tags (think tapping your Nouns glasses and bouncing to Nouns AR filters and more). We would like to put forward a future proposal to provide tags for community projects (as part of their proposals) that will be custom designed, programmed and integrated with our support. \n\n# Who we are\n\n## About Bounce\n\nBounce is a new cross-world avatar platform that makes it easy for fans and collectors to embody their avatars in immersive web2 and web3 platforms, and connect with their communities. We automate all platform-specific integrations, such as coding, rigging, file conversions and API & SDK connections, making it simple to use a unique physical or digital collectible (such as NFTs, sneakers, trading cards and more), generated based on unique traits, as an avatar across platforms. Our Bounce Tag uses active encryption NFC to ensure a secure and permanent link between authentic physical goods and their digital counterparts.\n\n- Learn more about Bounce - [letsbounce.gg](http://www.letsbounce.gg/)\n\n## Bounce partnerships with avatar communities\n\nA great example of how Bounce can help engage and activate a web3 community is our recent partnership with Wassies. Bounce allows the Wassies community to enjoy their fridge-dwelling creatures in new ways, from face filters on Snap and Instagram, to custom avatars on VR Chat, and create unique HD renders of their Wassie. \n\nWassies on Bounce can be viewed by everyone, holders can bounce their held ones, and CC0 Wassies are available for everyone to bounce.\n\nResponse from the Wassies community has been great, and the team has created a series of engaging events on Twitter and VR Chat that brought together fans and holders to play games, show off their unique renders and wassify their socials. \n\nBelow is footage from a Wassies concert in VRChat this weekend, powered by the Bounce VRChat integration.  \n![Wassie Event](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/wassiesEvent.gif)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Microsite for Bounce collab with Wassies](https://beta.letsbounce.gg/wassies)\n- [Wassies announcement tweet](https://twitter.com/bywassies/status/1709554217331949818) (41.4k impressions)\n- [Wassies VRChat event](https://twitter.com/bywassies/status/1710625261178228794)\n\n## The Team\n\nBounce is developed by Barak & Jasper, experienced creative technologists and builders in web3. Previously, they worked together at a Japanese art collective, [teamLab](https://www.teamlab.art/), and in 2021 they co-founded [Strata](https://www.strata.gallery/), a digital art incubator.  At Strata, they developed [DenDekaDen](https://www.dendekaden.com/) with Toei Animation (the Japanese animation studio behind One Piece and Dragon Ball Z).\n\n- More on [Barak](https://twitter.com/barakchamo)\n- More on [Jasper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasper-degens-7269a256/)\n\n## Q&A\n\n**onizuka.eth - Abstained**\n\n**Q**: I think there is a value in proliferating across Snap/Instagram, but I think there has already been progress made on filters there (from CoralOrca?) I'm not sure what exactly the public API would be for? general infrastructure like this can be valuable, but I'm not optimistic about something like the bounce site getting any sort of use from such a decentralized org like Nouns\n\n**A**: Great feedback and thanks for bringing up these points. CoralOrca and 0xFloyd have done fantastic work on [social filters](https://www.snapchat.com/explore/nouns/lenses), as well as [Noun 3D models](https://3dnouns.xyz/). This proposal builds on top of both of these by providing a hub where all experiences are easily accessible, not only social filters but also VR Chat, Mona, and any other platforms that will be integrated into Bounce in the future.\n\nOur goal is to make these cross-platform experiences easily accessible through all DAO projects, both web (with a public API to link directly to Nouns experiences) and physical (Bounce NFC tags, QR codes). The Bounce site will act as a hub for Nouns and other onboarded projects, and will help bring in other users and communities into the Nouniverse.","slug":"bounce-nouns-across-the-metaverse","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0xae9645f25b475d3860da99f237161fb77fd3417ebaf34dc203893e5e373528b0","reason":"Added Q&A section and updated images!"},{"blockNumber":18365734,"blockHash":"0x7e22d79e19fc6d010ab987f421d7bc6f665c56871594dde9a6fdd5ed7bd65f1d","transactionIndex":99,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0xdcc55974f88e7c956c2e63420469947e42e554ac8ee0150af78e91fac7a4963e","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0xF952A0788137Cef8Cba0B315a042262Ddc12c3aF","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000001cd2f6a466e12136a9e0b691bf86b0ca5f7a70ec0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001176592e00"],"description":"# One Noun, Every Day, Forever... in an Action Rogue-Lite Game!\n\n# PROPOSAL\n![NounsTown Promo](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Ff8c8617c-3190-4fc4-8dcc-2b088b4fd397%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=4e47bfa8-37e1-4112-bde8-7b1e0b996a25&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\nPlay as ***One Noun, Every Day, Forever***, in an action rogue-lite game developed in collaboration with ***Nouns*** and ***Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult*** to be released on ***Steam/PC!***\n\n###### TL;DR\nWe are asking for ***$75,000*** ***to fund the first 3-months of production*** for our indie Nouns game.  Check out our playable demo here (use Safari for MacOS users):\n[NounsTown Demo](https://thepixelshop.itch.io/nounstown-demo)\n\n\n# PROLIFERATION\nOur proposal aims to proliferate Nouns by focusing on a ***specific target market of the PC gaming community*** that is interested in indie games, specifically ***the rogue-lite genre***.  A rogue-lite indie game provides a compelling opportunity for Nouns to enter the gaming sector due to the following reasons:\n\n##### Rising Popularity\n- Indie developers have had incredible success in recent years due to their ability to design ***innovating*** and ***creative*** new games that AAA studios often avoid\n- Developers have gained access to multiple ***mass distribution platforms*** such as Steam, Nintendo Switch, Itch.io, and Epic Games to reach a wide audience\n- Available resources and advancements in game development have provided a landscape for small teams, or even individual developers, to produce games with a ***powerful cultural impact and longevity***\n\n##### Lower Risk Entry to Gaming\n- We conceptualized the game design to ensure as much value and ***replay-ability*** while maintaining a ***reasonable scope*** of work and ***longer-term scalability***\n- Our proposal provides for a ***phased funding and development approach*** to ensure a ***transparent production*** process, opportunities to receive ***community feedback***, and provide multiple ***tiers of content***\n- We will use ***Steam as our distribution platform*** to launch the game; however, we will explore porting the game to Nintendo Switch after the initial launch and financial considerations\n\n##### The Charm of Pixel Art\n- Our art team collectively has over ***30 years of pixel art experience*** and will design a game aesthetic that will resonate with indie gamers and pixel art enthusiasts\n- Pixel art games have had tremendous success with nearly ***13,000 games available on Steam.***  Some household names including Stardew Valley, Shovel Knight, Celeste, Terraria, Hyper Light Drifter, Enter the Gungeon, Octopath Traveler, and Baba is You\n- Our game will showcase many different pixel art styles including our ***modern aesthetic gameplay, retro style UI and game map, and high resolution portraits***\n\n##### Creative Commons\n- All of the ***art and animations*** that we produce during development will be ***open-source*** and available to the community to use!\n- ***After development***, we will ***consider making the game open-source*** to collaborate with game developers and artists to contribute new content\n\n# GAME OVERVIEW\n##### Game Engine\nThe game will be developed using ***Godot 4***, a free and open-source game development engine!  \n\n##### Genre\n**Rogue-Lite**\nThe key feature of a Rogue-Lite genre is a game loop that results in ***permadeath***.  Each time a player begins their attempt or run, they will either defeat the final boss or die trying.  A Rogue-Lite game generally involves some ***permanent progression*** that takes place ***outside of the run***; usually in the form of upgraded weapons, statistics, abilities, or skill trees.\n\n**Bullet Hell**\nBullet Hell combat mechanics emphasize ***complex bullet patterns*** for the player to navigate and dodge.  Our bullet hell game will be designed as a twin stick shooter where the player is on a ***flat plane with a top-down perspective***.  They will then use one joystick to control the player and the other joystick to control the direction of shooting, or for the real ones, mouse for shooting and keyboard for movement!\n\n**Non-Linear Progression**\nOne of the unique selling points of our Rogue-Lite game is that it will have Non-Linear progression.  The two main features to highlight in this design include a ***unique map that is generated each run*** and the freedom for the player to ***decide their order of progression***.    Each location will have distinct characteristics that the Player may take advantage of depending on their weapon selection and upgrade composition.  \n\n**Inspiration**\n[Enter the Gungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/), [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/), [Risk of Rain 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/), [Nuclear Throne](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/Nuclear_Throne/), [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/)\n\n\n##### Story\nWelcome to the world of ***Nouns Town***, a charming community nestled amidst pixelesque landscapes.  The citizens of **********Nouns Town********** are visionaries that seek to build a spectacular new world as seen through a new type of lens, ***Noggles**!*  These Noggles may look like quirky little glasses, but they empower the wearer to harness the boundless energy within themselves.\n\nBut an ominous cloud is forming over Nouns Town.  The malignant ***Lich King*** has arrived with an ***army of shadowy minions*** to seize these *Noggles* and exploit their power to build their own evil empire.

As they progress through the game, their weapon gets upgraded to powerful new tiers.  New weapons are unlocked through an achievements system and provide diverse play styles and synergies, for example:\n\n- Sniper Rifles - Slow fire rate and reload rate, but high single target damage\n- Shotguns - high close range damage, but wide bullet spread at long range\n- Rocket and Grenade Launchers - significant area of effect damage, but slow reload speed and fire rate\n- Assault rifles - higher ammo capacity and fire rate, but less damage per bullet\n\n**Sample** **Weapons:**\n![Weapon Concepts](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F457fa7a0-a1a4-4ec4-ad5d-b0887aa853cb%2Fweapons.png?table=block&id=f4229042-9adf-4a99-9c0c-83b4fcdde425&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Upgrades\nAs the player clears each room,  they are rewarded a pair of Noggles to return to their rightful owner and gain a new weapon modifier.  Each upgrade is inspired by various characters from the Nouns collection.  Early concepts include:\n\n- Lightning Bolt Noun unlocks chain lightning\n- Basketball Noun unlocks bouncing bullets\n- Popsicle Noun unlocks frost bullets\n- Pencil Noun unlocks piercing bullets\n- Chipboard Noun unlocks spark aura\n- Baseball Noun unlocks curving bullets\n\nPlayer upgrades each have multiple tiers of strength.  Further, different combinations of upgrades will create fun synergies and provide a unique gameplay experience each run.  Unique and innovative upgrades will be explored during game development.\n\n![Upgrade Card Previews](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Feef9abba-1288-4e3d-9be3-02216f525651%2Fnouns_upgrades_promo.png?table=block&id=d9a79c15-bee4-42f8-ae7e-5b1a53e0d826&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Minions and Bosses\n\nMinions and Bosses will be based on the Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult: Forgotten Souls collection.  All minions will be designed to have a diverse range of attack styles and bullet patterns.  Early attack style concepts include melee, burst range, sniper range, summoners, and complex bullet patterns for elite minions.  \n\nWe will use rare NFTs from the Forgotten Souls collection as our Stage Bosses and the Lich King as our final boss.  Our first Boss engagement will be designed and implemented in Phase I of production.\n\n**Sample** **Minion Designs:**\n![Minion Concepts](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Fed2d7a9a-3f76-484b-9c3b-a8bef7f00f4a%2Fminions.png?table=block&id=c90faec9-9a19-40dc-9b9a-aeab46b202ab&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Map and Room Design\n\nWith the game’s setting taking place in Nouns Town, our protagonist will progress through the map to clear each location of the Forgotten Souls.  As mentioned in the Genre section above, our map and game loop will have a ***Non-Linear*** design.  The design will have the following characteristics:\n\n**Unique Generative Maps**\n\n- Each run will generate a new Nouns Town map seed with approximately 30 - 45 Locations, 2 Stage Boss chambers, and 1 Final Boss chamber\n- The Player will have the freedom to decide which locations to clear first\n\n**NPC and Event Rooms**\n\n- We will include friendly NPCs and locations to provide healing, potential upgrades, and/or narrative progression\n- Additionally, we are exploring various Event Rooms that occur random times throughout each run that provide new challenges for the player\n\n**Room Architecture**\n\n- We will design a large library of Locations and Rooms that the map generator will pull from to maintain a unique and diverse world for each play through\n- Room types within each location will have consistent thematic designs to provide new challenges and allow the player to associate location aesthetics to gameplay characteristics\n\n**Room Decorations**\n\n- We will produce a library of tile sets, decorations, barriers, and destructible objects to fill each room with a fun and unique personality inspired by Nouns\n- We will mix and match each room’s architecture to various aesthetics to give each room a unique personality and provide diversity between each run\n\n**Sample assets:**\n![Tile Set Preview](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F440c398d-3d22-4e10-93c7-1ed447b2e1ca%2Ftileset_sample.png?table=block&id=7419a6e2-cfd2-4208-9a47-5d3715964af5&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Sound Design\n\nFull sound design will include sound effects and an original soundtrack.

Check out our playable demo here (use Safari for MacOS users):\n[NounsTown Demo](https://thepixelshop.itch.io/nounstown-demo)\n\n\n# PROLIFERATION\nOur proposal aims to proliferate Nouns by focusing on a ***specific target market of the PC gaming community*** that is interested in indie games, specifically ***the rogue-lite genre***.  A rogue-lite indie game provides a compelling opportunity for Nouns to enter the gaming sector due to the following reasons:\n\n##### Rising Popularity\n- Indie developers have had incredible success in recent years due to their ability to design ***innovating*** and ***creative*** new games that AAA studios often avoid\n- Developers have gained access to multiple ***mass distribution platforms*** such as Steam, Nintendo Switch, Itch.io, and Epic Games to reach a wide audience\n- Available resources and advancements in game development have provided a landscape for small teams, or even individual developers, to produce games with a ***powerful cultural impact and longevity***\n\n##### Lower Risk Entry to Gaming\n- We conceptualized the game design to ensure as much value and ***replay-ability*** while maintaining a ***reasonable scope*** of work and ***longer-term scalability***\n- Our proposal provides for a ***phased funding and development approach*** to ensure a ***transparent production*** process, opportunities to receive ***community feedback***, and provide multiple ***tiers of content***\n- We will use ***Steam as our distribution platform*** to launch the game; however, we will explore porting the game to Nintendo Switch after the initial launch and financial considerations\n\n##### The Charm of Pixel Art\n- Our art team collectively has over ***30 years of pixel art experience*** and will design a game aesthetic that will resonate with indie gamers and pixel art enthusiasts\n- Pixel art games have had tremendous success with nearly ***13,000 games available on Steam.***  Some household names including Stardew Valley, Shovel Knight, Celeste, Terraria, Hyper Light Drifter, Enter the Gungeon, Octopath Traveler, and Baba is You\n- Our game will showcase many different pixel art styles including our ***modern aesthetic gameplay, retro style UI and game map, and high resolution portraits***\n\n##### Creative Commons\n- All of the ***art and animations*** that we produce during development will be ***open-source*** and available to the community to use!\n- ***After development***, we will ***consider making the game open-source*** to collaborate with game developers and artists to contribute new content\n\n# GAME OVERVIEW\n##### Game Engine\nThe game will be developed using ***Godot 4***, a free and open-source game development engine!  \n\n##### Genre\n**Rogue-Lite**\nThe key feature of a Rogue-Lite genre is a game loop that results in ***permadeath***.  Each time a player begins their attempt or run, they will either defeat the final boss or die trying.  A Rogue-Lite game generally involves some ***permanent progression*** that takes place ***outside of the run***; usually in the form of upgraded weapons, statistics, abilities, or skill trees.\n\n**Bullet Hell**\nBullet Hell combat mechanics emphasize ***complex bullet patterns*** for the player to navigate and dodge.  Our bullet hell game will be designed as a twin stick shooter where the player is on a ***flat plane with a top-down perspective***.  They will then use one joystick to control the player and the other joystick to control the direction of shooting, or for the real ones, mouse for shooting and keyboard for movement!\n\n**Non-Linear Progression**\nOne of the unique selling points of our Rogue-Lite game is that it will have Non-Linear progression.  The two main features to highlight in this design include a ***unique map that is generated each run*** and the freedom for the player to ***decide their order of progression***.    Each location will have distinct characteristics that the Player may take advantage of depending on their weapon selection and upgrade composition.  \n\n**Inspiration**\n[Enter the Gungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/), [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/), [Risk of Rain 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/), [Nuclear Throne](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/Nuclear_Throne/), [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/)\n\n\n##### Story\nWelcome to the world of ***Nouns Town***, a charming community nestled amidst pixelesque landscapes.  The citizens of **********Nouns Town********** are visionaries that seek to build a spectacular new world as seen through a new type of lens, ***Noggles**!*  These Noggles may look like quirky little glasses, but they empower the wearer to harness the boundless energy within themselves.\n\nBut an ominous cloud is forming over Nouns Town.  The malignant ***Lich King*** has arrived with an ***army of shadowy minions*** to seize these *Noggles* and exploit their power to build their own evil empire.  Nouns Town desperately needs a hero to put an end to the invasion!\n\n##### Primary Game Mode: One Noun, Every Day, Forever\n- Play as a new Nouns character every rolling 24-hour period beginning with Noun #1 and all Nouns that follow\n- Every player will attempt the daily run with the same weapon, world map, upgrade choices, and enemy spawns\n- The map seed will change each day along with the playable character\n- Compete against all other players on the leaderboard for the fastest clear time\n- All daily winners will secure their place in the game’s history!\n\n![A Noun A Day Promo](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Febdf3ba8-dbc9-460f-8931-857889572ea5%2Fstage_nouns_v_souls.png?table=block&id=cbaa22ac-9c9d-4d42-856c-64c595492dde&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Traditional Game Mode: Protonoun\n**Play as the Protonoun in a traditional rogue-lite game mode**\n- Select your starting weapon and begin your run in a unique generative map\n- Gain Upgrades as you progress through each room of enemies\n- Search for two hidden keys to unlock each stage Boss\n- Encounter NPCs and Events as you explore the map\n- Complete achievements during your run to unlock new content\n- Defeat the final boss, the Lich King, to beat the game\n\n![The Protocave](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F91f59fde-3358-41dc-8a8a-14f1721c4141%2Fprotocave.png?table=block&id=dd19d7a6-e01a-4bd6-86b1-838af593bf3d&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Weapons\n\nThe player will begin each run by selecting a single weapon type.  As they progress through the game, their weapon gets upgraded to powerful new tiers.  New weapons are unlocked through an achievements system and provide diverse play styles and synergies, for example:\n\n- Sniper Rifles - Slow fire rate and reload rate, but high single target damage\n- Shotguns - high close range damage, but wide bullet spread at long range\n- Rocket and Grenade Launchers - significant area of effect damage, but slow reload speed and fire rate\n- Assault rifles - higher ammo capacity and fire rate, but less damage per bullet\n\n**Sample** **Weapons:**\n![Weapon Concepts](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F457fa7a0-a1a4-4ec4-ad5d-b0887aa853cb%2Fweapons.png?table=block&id=f4229042-9adf-4a99-9c0c-83b4fcdde425&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Upgrades\nAs the player clears each room,  they are rewarded a pair of Noggles to return to their rightful owner and gain a new weapon modifier.  Each upgrade is inspired by various characters from the Nouns collection.  Early concepts include:\n\n- Lightning Bolt Noun unlocks chain lightning\n- Basketball Noun unlocks bouncing bullets\n- Popsicle Noun unlocks frost bullets\n- Pencil Noun unlocks piercing bullets\n- Chipboard Noun unlocks spark aura\n- Baseball Noun unlocks curving bullets\n\nPlayer upgrades each have multiple tiers of strength.  Further, different combinations of upgrades will create fun synergies and provide a unique gameplay experience each run.  Unique and innovative upgrades will be explored during game development.\n\n![Upgrade Card Previews](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Feef9abba-1288-4e3d-9be3-02216f525651%2Fnouns_upgrades_promo.png?table=block&id=d9a79c15-bee4-42f8-ae7e-5b1a53e0d826&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Minions and Bosses\n\nMinions and Bosses will be based on the Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult: Forgotten Souls collection.  All minions will be designed to have a diverse range of attack styles and bullet patterns.  Early attack style concepts include melee, burst range, sniper range, summoners, and complex bullet patterns for elite minions.  \n\nWe will use rare NFTs from the Forgotten Souls collection as our Stage Bosses and the Lich King as our final boss.  Our first Boss engagement will be designed and implemented in Phase I of production.\n\n**Sample** **Minion Designs:**\n![Minion Concepts](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Fed2d7a9a-3f76-484b-9c3b-a8bef7f00f4a%2Fminions.png?table=block&id=c90faec9-9a19-40dc-9b9a-aeab46b202ab&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Map and Room Design\n\nWith the game’s setting taking place in Nouns Town, our protagonist will progress through the map to clear each location of the Forgotten Souls.  As mentioned in the Genre section above, our map and game loop will have a ***Non-Linear*** design.  The design will have the following characteristics:\n\n**Unique Generative Maps**\n\n- Each run will generate a new Nouns Town map seed with approximately 30 - 45 Locations, 2 Stage Boss chambers, and 1 Final Boss chamber\n- The Player will have the freedom to decide which locations to clear first\n\n**NPC and Event Rooms**\n\n- We will include friendly NPCs and locations to provide healing, potential upgrades, and/or narrative progression\n- Additionally, we are exploring various Event Rooms that occur random times throughout each run that provide new challenges for the player\n\n**Room Architecture**\n\n- We will design a large library of Locations and Rooms that the map generator will pull from to maintain a unique and diverse world for each play through\n- Room types within each location will have consistent thematic designs to provide new challenges and allow the player to associate location aesthetics to gameplay characteristics\n\n**Room Decorations**\n\n- We will produce a library of tile sets, decorations, barriers, and destructible objects to fill each room with a fun and unique personality inspired by Nouns\n- We will mix and match each room’s architecture to various aesthetics to give each room a unique personality and provide diversity between each run\n\n**Sample assets:**\n![Tile Set Preview](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F440c398d-3d22-4e10-93c7-1ed447b2e1ca%2Ftileset_sample.png?table=block&id=7419a6e2-cfd2-4208-9a47-5d3715964af5&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Sound Design\n\nFull sound design will include sound effects and an original soundtrack.

We should expand this to the core  Nouns artwork with an experimental open edition that allows fans and Nouns-curious folks to build their own Noun. This could be a fun Droposal event that onboards many new Nouns players via a fun, experimental, yet meaningful, open edition. If there's interest, it could unlock a new primitive within Nouns.\n\n## HOW\nAnyone can mint a Character on an infinite open edition. A character (an NFT) holds Traits (also NFTs) - noggles, heads, etc… They can then equip those traits and the character will reflect them visually onchain.\n\nThe distribution of the NFT traits will happen via a 3-day open edition on a standalone site, where users can mint every trait, and build their Noun. Then, supply will end and those NFTs will be accessible on secondary only.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/xJ7Qg16/Editor.png)\n\n## TECH\nEverything will be deployed on Base for low gas fees. The DAO will be the owner of the contracts and will be able to easily add new traits to the registry via Droposals. If there is any centralization needed, we will come back to the DAO to make decisions.\n\nCharacter / Noun NFT ([Loot2 Example](https://basescan.org/token/0xadbc7ec633b78dc4407215d56eb0861dd7c51431)) holds the NFTs, is mintable forever so that anyone can join. Trait NFTs ([Loot2 Example](https://basescan.org/token/0xb7d488da393b4f34813dabeb295931a2b86ea505#code)) will all be sold in a 3-day open edition, where users can pick which traits to mint, as many of each as they want. New traits can be added to the contracts via DAO Proposals (community submissions or noundry creations for example).\n\n## DETAILS\nWe aim to have the project completed by the end of November. The mint fee will be similar to Zora's - 0.001 ETH, or ~$1. If this can reach a large audience like past Droposals, this could bring significant revenue to the DAO. For reference, This is Nouns minted 3,500 editions at 0.05 ETH, or 175 ETH total.\n\nCompensation:\n-   3 ETH to [Station](https://www.station.express/) for contract work\n-   5% of mint fees each for Michael and Martin (based on Agora’s [Droposals fee](https://nouns.wtf/vote/346)) via 0xSplits.","slug":"common-nouns---collectible-traits-with-erc6551","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0xc5f51b032ce3ac870b2c64ea825921e82d41240e13da62b6b74984147afc5a65","reason":""},{"blockNumber":18371744,"blockHash":"0x434660e470da9acf31ee84aff2f08501d408f36d25f1ea83ff8fa7bd27b5ee9a","transactionIndex":189,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0x24bd0576f26548fbf2250c114ef68d45cf01aa75b7c2eb4d8d112d2ad07ff92b","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0x4DAAc1943c42B5988629414af1c32936601E81ea","targets":["0x5BbA40D2ca3E144CCA763E644E33476f0f0f3152"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"description":"# Real World Nouns Asset Purchase\n\nNounsDAO is among one of the most prominent communities and ecosystems in web3. For the last couple years, Nouns has led the charge on a new way for projects and ideas to get funded. Over this time, the vast majority of funding was issued with few strings attached or promise of financial returns - instead, focusing on funding things the community wants to see happen in the world. \n\nThis proposal is an experiment to break ground on a new kind of proposal: one that has the potential to provide perks to Nouns holders, and that has the potential to generate financial returns on deployed capital to ultimately increase demand for Nouns NFTs. \n\n**Some background on Venture Club**\n\nVenture Club is a web2.5 project that has been building legal infrastructure to democratize capital formation over the last 1.5 years. Our core focus is on taking offchain assets (such as equity, SAFEs, SAFTs, Income sharing agreements, real estate, etc), and moving them compliantly onchain as NFTs, in different UIs. The NFTs created are DeFi compatible between KYCd addresses and allow-listed smart contracts. \n\nYou can see some of the assets we’ve minted onchain [here](https://opensea.io/collection/venture-club).\n\nOur proposal is a proof of concept, to demonstrate the ability of Nouns DAOs to participate in the purchase of traditional real world assets. We believe this option will open up new use cases for NounsDAOs, which have not yet been possible before.\n\n**Why should you care?**\n\nHaving a clear and tested process to acquire “real world” assets has the potential to benefit current and future Nouns members. The main reasons why this should be of interest are:\n\n1. Provide perks to members. For example, a piece of real estate could be purchased, and access could be given to Nouns members. Or rental income could be shared with Nouns members. Having access to these sort of assets most definitely helps propagate the Nouns meme, while simultaneously providing a very tangible benefit. \n2. Provide Nouns holders a means to benefit financially from teams and startups they support via the DAO.\n\n**A Proof of Concept**\n\nThis proposal is a proof of concept (POC), to demonstrate that 1. NounsDAO can deploy capital to purchase an offchain asset; and that 2. ownership of this offchain asset can be claimed compliantly by its NounsDAO members. *This POC aims to demonstrate this concept via the purchase of an ownership stake in Venture Club, who has built the technology to make these offchain purchases possible.*\n\nOur hope is that this model can be used in the future by NounsDAO to invest and acquire a variety of new asset classes which has not been possible until now (to our knowledge, a few projects have tried, but none have been able to provide a clear / compliant path forward). \n\nBy proving this model out, it may even be possible that we see an increased demand for Nouns NFTs from speculators looking for exposure to assets and opportunities only available to this community. \n\nThe end result is a NounsDAO with **an increased number of options** in front of it. Options to engage, options to reward, options to monetize and attract - in order to create a more desirable community to be a part of. \n\n**Our proposal**\n\n- We are asking the NounsDAO community to make a strategic 50 ETH investment in Venture Club (via a SAFE investment agreement).\n- Ownership in the investment will be split between all Nouns members who claim their personal ownership in the SAFE via the Venture Club app.\n- As a US based company focused on tokenization of securities, Venture Club takes compliance seriously. Only KYCd individuals will be able to claim ownership in the SAFE. In addition, unaccredited US investors will not be able to participate. For individuals who don’t meet these criteria, they will be able to sell their right to claim to someone else who can claim, ensuring everyone can benefit from this process.\n- As part of the Venture Club tokenization process, it is possible to set carry fee (currently 1%), as well as royalty fees (currently 5%) on secondary sales of NFTs. In order to incentivize the sponsoring of this proposal, fees arising from this proposal will be shared equally between Venture Club and those who sponsor this proposal.\n\n**Milestones and next steps / sequence of events**\n\n- Once this proposal is approved, a deal page will be published on Venture Club\n- A Discord channel will be created in the Venture Club Discord to provide any support\n- Nouns holders will be able to access the opportunity on our app, and mint their respective share of the SAFE contract via an NFT\n- Once this proof of concept is complete, we would like to work with other teams looking to provide tangible benefits to Nouns holders.\n\n**Some additional information**\n\n- Some of our investors: [Gabby](https://twitter.com/gabusch) (Founder of YGG), [Timour](https://twitter.com/timourxyz) (Seed Club), [MetaCartel Ventures](https://metacartel.xyz/) (first venture dao in web3), Evgeny (founder of [Re7](https://www.re7.capital/)), Ben Middleton (founding partner at [Ascensive Assets](https://ascensiveassets.com/)), [Cultur3 Capital](https://cultur3.capital/) (web3 focused fund), among others\n- Our [slide deck](https://cloudfiles.to/yw9rM7pi48O) (pw:Seed23)\n- Our app: [app.ventureclub.club](http://app.ventureclub.club) (note, we’ve created a group for Nouns which you can join on the Network tab.

We believe this option will open up new use cases for NounsDAOs, which have not yet been possible before.\n\n**Why should you care?**\n\nHaving a clear and tested process to acquire “real world” assets has the potential to benefit current and future Nouns members. The main reasons why this should be of interest are:\n\n1. Provide perks to members. For example, a piece of real estate could be purchased, and access could be given to Nouns members. Or rental income could be shared with Nouns members. Having access to these sort of assets most definitely helps propagate the Nouns meme, while simultaneously providing a very tangible benefit. \n2. Provide Nouns holders a means to benefit financially from teams and startups they support via the DAO.\n\n**A Proof of Concept**\n\nThis proposal is a proof of concept (POC), to demonstrate that 1. NounsDAO can deploy capital to purchase an offchain asset; and that 2. ownership of this offchain asset can be claimed compliantly by its NounsDAO members. *This POC aims to demonstrate this concept via the purchase of an ownership stake in Venture Club, who has built the technology to make these offchain purchases possible.*\n\nOur hope is that this model can be used in the future by NounsDAO to invest and acquire a variety of new asset classes which has not been possible until now (to our knowledge, a few projects have tried, but none have been able to provide a clear / compliant path forward). \n\nBy proving this model out, it may even be possible that we see an increased demand for Nouns NFTs from speculators looking for exposure to assets and opportunities only available to this community. \n\nThe end result is a NounsDAO with **an increased number of options** in front of it. Options to engage, options to reward, options to monetize and attract - in order to create a more desirable community to be a part of. \n\n**Our proposal**\n\n- We are asking the NounsDAO community to make a strategic 50 ETH investment in Venture Club (via a SAFE investment agreement).\n- Ownership in the investment will be split between all Nouns members who claim their personal ownership in the SAFE via the Venture Club app.\n- Payment for proportional ownership in the SAFE will be made in a fresh ERC20 token that will be airdropped to all Nouns holders. This is a utility token, used as payment only.\n- As a US based company focused on tokenization of securities, Venture Club takes compliance seriously. Only KYCd individuals will be able to claim ownership in the SAFE. In addition, unaccredited US investors will not be able to participate. \n- For individuals who don’t meet these criteria, they will be able to sell their ERC20 payment token for their portion of the SAFE using P2P tools like airswap. Venture Club will help facilitate this process via our Discord.\n- As part of the Venture Club tokenization process, it is possible to set carry fee (currently 1%), as well as royalty fees (currently 5%) on secondary sales of NFTs. In order to incentivize the sponsoring of this proposal, fees arising from this proposal will be shared equally between Venture Club and those who sponsor this proposal.\n\n**Milestones and next steps / sequence of events**\n\n- Once this proposal is approved, a deal page will be published on Venture Club\n- A Discord channel will be created in the Venture Club Discord to provide any support\n- Nouns holders will be able to access the opportunity on our app, and mint their respective share of the SAFE contract via an NFT\n- Once this proof of concept is complete, we would like to work with other teams looking to provide tangible benefits to Nouns holders.\n- We will timebox the duration to 2 months after the proposal passing to claim ownership rights.\n\n**Some additional information**\n\n- Some of our investors: [Gabby](https://twitter.com/gabusch) (Founder of YGG), [Timour](https://twitter.com/timourxyz) (Seed Club), [MetaCartel Ventures](https://metacartel.xyz/) (first venture dao in web3), Evgeny (founder of [Re7](https://www.re7.capital/)), Ben Middleton (founding partner at [Ascensive Assets](https://ascensiveassets.com/)), [Cultur3 Capital](https://cultur3.capital/) (web3 focused fund), among others\n- Our [slide deck](https://cloudfiles.to/yw9rM7pi48O) (pw:Seed23)\n- Our app: [app.ventureclub.club](http://app.ventureclub.club) (note, we’ve created a group for Nouns which you can join on the Network tab.

Decked out in noggles, experiencing Nouns stories, interacting with vibrant Nouns sculptures and characters, and immersing themselves in a world where disability, disadvantage, or illness doesn't define them. Instead, they're celebrated for their individuality and spirit, all while being introduced to the imaginative universe of Nouns. This is the magic of the Variety Kids Xmas Party, and with your support, we can make it an unforgettable experience.*\n### Introduction:\nThe Variety Kids Xmas Party is an annual event held in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia that brings joy and inclusion to over 5,000 Victorian children facing diverse challenges. We seek Nouns DAO's support of 28.99 ETH to enhance this iconic event, held across 39,000 square metres, with the Nouns bringing the FUN and ENTERTAINMENT, ensuring a memorable experience for all attendees including:\n* 5,000 kids in need\n* 3,000 parents and carers\n* 600 corporate volunteers\n* 100 VIP guests\n\nThis year's party will be held in mid-December 2023.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SybKqjyga.jpg)\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Background:\nFor over three decades, the Variety Kids Xmas Party has been a beacon of hope for kids in need. Held at the Melbourne Convention Exhibition Centre, this event has touched the lives of over 165,000 children since its inception in 1986. The massive event is completely FREE for 5,000 children and 3,000 carers to attend, ensuring that each child receives a gift and experiences an inclusive day of fun, activities, stage entertainment, carnival rides, all-abilities sport and an all-important visit from Santa. For many, this celebration is the only one they have during the Christmas season, and the gifts they receive at the party are often the only ones they receive. The Variety Kids Xmas Party is a safe space for children living with disabilities or experiencing disadvantage or illness, allowing them to be themselves without fear of judgment from their peers. This remarkable event is made possible by the dedication and hard work of the small Variety team and over 600 volunteers.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkJSDa1xp.jpg)\n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Profound Impact:\nThe Variety Kids Xmas Party is more than just a day of fun; it&#39;s a lifeline for families who often feel isolated or overlooked. For many children, the event offers a rare opportunity to experience joy, laughter, and a sense of belonging. Parents often remark on the transformative effect of the party, noting the boost in their children's confidence and self-esteem. The ripple effect extends beyond the children to their families, providing them with a much-needed respite and the chance to see their children thrive in a supportive environment. The memories created during the party serve as a source of strength and inspiration for families throughout the year.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkJ5cjkxT.jpg)\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Testimonials:\n\"You have no idea what this means to us.

On average, previous Xmas Parties have cost USD $160,000 and have been funded from Variety's non-profit funds.\n\nVariety is committed to continue to fund this event with the knowledge that it is crucial for thousands of families whose children are living with disabilities, illnesses, or experiencing disadvantages. It serves as a day of joy and inclusion, often providing the only Christmas celebration and gifts these children receive. For over three decades, this event has been sustained by year-round contributions from our dedicated individual of donors and fundraisers.\n\nThe current cost-of-living crisis has intensified the needs of our most vulnerable families, increasing the demand for our support. Simultaneously, community donations have become less frequent, as they are no longer as possible for some individuals as they once were.\n\nIf the Nouns prop passes to fund the 2023 event, the money previously allocated for it will be redirected to our individual grant program, which provides essential items like wheelchairs, communication devices, scholarships, education programs and assistance dogs for kids experiencing disadvantage or living with conditions including Cerebral Palsy, Down Syndrome, Autism, global development delay, muscular dystrophy, brain\ninjury, spinal injury, rare and chronic disease and more.\n\nVariety – the Children’s Charity request a total of ~USDC 47,479 (28.99 ETH) to fund the Nouns brand fun and entertainment zones.

In addition to accepting crypto donations for over 2 years, their innovative approach includes, joining and submitting a successful proposal with Blueberry DAO, being recognised as the charity of choice for notable entities like NFT Melbourne and Oshi Gallery and being an active beneficiary of various NFT auctions.\n\n###Addressing comments in candidature\n\nThank you all so much for your amazing support and feedback!\n\nIn regards to paid social advertising, external channels have been removed.

Decked out in noggles, experiencing Nouns stories, interacting with vibrant Nouns sculptures and characters, and immersing themselves in a world where disability, disadvantage, or illness doesn't define them. Instead, they're celebrated for their individuality and spirit, all while being introduced to the imaginative universe of Nouns. This is the magic of the Variety Kids Xmas Party, and with your support, we can make it an unforgettable experience.*\n### Introduction:\nThe Variety Kids Xmas Party is an annual event held in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia that brings joy and inclusion to over 5,000 Victorian children facing diverse challenges. We seek Nouns DAO's support of 28.99 ETH to enhance this iconic event, held across 39,000 square metres, with the Nouns bringing the FUN and ENTERTAINMENT, ensuring a memorable experience for all attendees including:\n* 5,000 kids in need\n* 3,000 parents and carers\n* 600 corporate volunteers\n* 100 VIP guests\n\nThis year's party will be held in mid-December 2023.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SybKqjyga.jpg)\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Background:\nFor over three decades, the Variety Kids Xmas Party has been a beacon of hope for kids in need. Held at the Melbourne Convention Exhibition Centre, this event has touched the lives of over 165,000 children since its inception in 1986. The massive event is completely FREE for 5,000 children and 3,000 carers to attend, ensuring that each child receives a gift and experiences an inclusive day of fun, activities, stage entertainment, carnival rides, all-abilities sport and an all-important visit from Santa. For many, this celebration is the only one they have during the Christmas season, and the gifts they receive at the party are often the only ones they receive. The Variety Kids Xmas Party is a safe space for children living with disabilities or experiencing disadvantage or illness, allowing them to be themselves without fear of judgment from their peers. This remarkable event is made possible by the dedication and hard work of the small Variety team and over 600 volunteers.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkJSDa1xp.jpg)\n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Profound Impact:\nThe Variety Kids Xmas Party is more than just a day of fun; it&#39;s a lifeline for families who often feel isolated or overlooked. For many children, the event offers a rare opportunity to experience joy, laughter, and a sense of belonging. Parents often remark on the transformative effect of the party, noting the boost in their children's confidence and self-esteem. The ripple effect extends beyond the children to their families, providing them with a much-needed respite and the chance to see their children thrive in a supportive environment. The memories created during the party serve as a source of strength and inspiration for families throughout the year.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkJ5cjkxT.jpg)\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Testimonials:\n\"You have no idea what this means to us. Without Variety, we were having no Christmas.\" Kayla\n\n“Being on your own and battling to afford the basics, you are so conscious of trying to make Christmas special. I will be forever thankful that Variety did that for me and my boys this Christmas.” Shelly, parent of Jaxon and Dylan.\n\nTo make the day even more special, each child receives a gift bag full of age-appropriate toys and games (including Nounish items) to take home and enjoy. For some children, this was the only gift they received that Christmas.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryvQ5jklT.jpg)\n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Videos and imagery:\n\nWatch the party in action – news coverage of last year's event \n[7 News Click here to play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8bpybGRlZY&themeRefresh=1)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H17HSTyea.png)\n\n[9 News Click here to play ](https://youtu.be/GXfgo3frPww)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJx9B6yxa.png)\n\nMeet some of the families who attend and hear what it means to them \n[Click here to watch Seth & Teagan's Variety Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhk80WxPSyk)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1gBLaJea.png)\n\n**Click here to view our gallery** of [pictures of the day](https://photos.app.goo.gl/GATPZpPnU5TEy7nTA) \n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ A Nounish Christmas Deliverables:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1AOkl6x6.png)\n\n\nTo elevate the 2023 Variety Kids Xmas Party, we propose the Nouns brand activations in synchronicity with the Variety red branding where Nouns bring the FUN and ENTERTAINMENT!

On average, previous Xmas Parties have cost USD $160,000 and have been funded from Variety's non-profit funds.\n\nVariety is committed to continue to fund this event with the knowledge that it is crucial for thousands of families whose children are living with disabilities, illnesses, or experiencing disadvantages. It serves as a day of joy and inclusion, often providing the only Christmas celebration and gifts these children receive. For over three decades, this event has been sustained by year-round contributions from our dedicated individual of donors and fundraisers.\n\nThe current cost-of-living crisis has intensified the needs of our most vulnerable families, increasing the demand for our support. Simultaneously, community donations have become less frequent, as they are no longer as possible for some individuals as they once were.\n\nIf the Nouns prop passes to fund the 2023 event, the money previously allocated for it will be redirected to our individual grant program, which provides essential items like wheelchairs, communication devices, scholarships, education programs and assistance dogs for kids experiencing disadvantage or living with conditions including Cerebral Palsy, Down Syndrome, Autism, global development delay, muscular dystrophy, brain\ninjury, spinal injury, rare and chronic disease and more.\n\nVariety – the Children’s Charity requests a total of ~USDC 47,479 (28.99 ETH) to fund the Nouns brand fun and entertainment zones. Variety will be contributing ~USDC 113,000 to cover the balance of event costs.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryuBcikxp.jpg)\n\n\n**BUDGET**\n\n* Entertainment – all on-stage performers, Santa, dancers, character performers such as the Grinch and Real Dinosaurs, carnival rides including a ferris wheel, sideshow alley, Santa’s grotto, all-abilities sports activations, silent movie cinema, and main stage visual, LED screens, audio, staging, stage lighting & rigging  **$32,511 USD/19.85 ETH**\n* Photography/filming and package creation **$3,219 USD/1.97 ETH**\n* Nouns Noggles - donated **$0 USD/0 ETH**\n* LEGO - donated **$0 USD/0 ETH**\n* Colouring sheets - printing **$645 USD/0.39 ETH**\n* Free standing foam Noggles sculpture **$645 USD/0.39 ETH**\n* Nouns signage x 25 **$804 USD/0.49 ETH**\n* Nouns character costume **$4,506 USD/2.75 ETH**\n* 600 Nouns branded tees worn by corporate volunteers across the venue **$3,862 USD/2.36 ETH**\n* 2,000 temporary Noggles tattoos **$1,287 USD/0.79 ETH**\n\n **TOTAL  **$47,479** USD  /  **28.99** ETH**\n\n*** USD to ETH conversion correct at time of writing 19 September 2023 3.00pm AEST\n\nIn addition, Variety will be paying USD $128k (funded across the year by our donors) as follows\n* Catering extras (90% catering sponsor)\t$7,443\n* Event management and non-main stage venue AV, staging & rigging\t$31,900\n* Venue hire cost\t$15,400\n* Gift bag of toys for every child\t$64,169\n* Transport, freight, couriers and postage \t$2,951\n* Staffing, logistics, and marketing\t$6,416\n\t\n    \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1L_0i1x6.jpg)\n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ The Team\n**Georgie Smith - Variety Project Lead**\n[Georgie](https://https://twitter.com/RoxbySmith) has a twenty-five-year career in not-for-profit fundraising, marketing and event management and currently leads Variety – the Children’s Charity digital innovation program including crypto philanthropy.

Villa Nouns aims to be the ultimate destination for Nouns fans and newcomers alike, a place that blurs the line between onchain and offchain.\n\nMore than a place to stay, our goal is to create a highly curated, customisable, Nouns-themed venue open to all. By encouraging innovation, art, education and fun experiences, Villa Nouns will reflect the Nouns values and ethos in the real world, while meeting the growing demand for immersive experiences inside and outside of the Nouns community. \n\n**How it works**\n\n- **Book** your stay on Airbnb, or onchain from villanouns.wtf.\n- **Access** the villa with your wallet, and share access with others onchain. No physical keys needed.\n- **Explore** the spaces to discover and interact with the Nouns universe.\n- **Buy** nounish furniture, items or NFTs directly at the villa, with your Ethereum wallet.\n\nRevenue generated from bookings and sales of nounish items will be partly channeled back into the Nouns treasury, as well as shared with partnering communities and Nouns owners.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nWe plan to complete all work in 12 to 24 weeks and start welcoming guests by 2024.\n\n**Team**\n\n- **Management**: Led by the villa owner, an experienced property developer.\n- **Development**: Carried out by dlabs, known for working on projects like Nouns Agora, Optimism, Slice and Juicebox.\n- **Design and art**: Made by skilled architects, designers and artists.\n- **Community**: Nouns owners and communities will be able to partner up with us and become sponsors of the project, further customising the spaces at the villa.\n\n**Funding request**\n\nWe request 121 ETH to give the villa a nounish makeover, cover operational expenses for 1 year, as well as ensure guests have a highly curated experience.\n\nThe villa in its present state is already a sought-after location in the area. Renovating it will only add to its popularity, so execution risks are minimal.\n\nThe primary goal of this project is to explore the potential of a nounish vacation destination, gauging both demand and impact, while keeping risks and costs low for the DAO.\n\nThe villa will stay Nouns-themed for at least 2 years, and possibly indefinitely. This fact together with the growth potential and the future plans outlined below further help justifying the expense.\n\n**Future plans**\n\nThe proposal aims to fund the redesign of the villa and cover operational costs, but our commitment doesn’t stop there. In the coming months we’ll explore the following areas, either autonomously or with further support from the DAO:\n\n- **Nounish home goods**: In collaboration with artists and designers, we’ll craft a line of items and furniture inspired by Nouns. They'll first appear at Villa Nouns and then will be available for everyone to buy, helping to proliferate the Nouns vibe far and wide.\n- **Activities for everyone**: We’ll offer a range of activities to enhance the guest experience further. Think pools, sports areas, dining spots, and curated outdoor adventures for kids and adults.\n- **Builders retreats**: During the low-season we plan to host artists, hackers, and creators to brainstorm and build on nounish ideas, free of charge. Leveraging Prop House for the selection process, Villa Nouns will be temporarily turned into a hub sparking innovative projects and fostering connections in the Nouns ecosystem.\n- **More spaces, more stories**: We plan to open more properties locally and around the world, especially in places rich in art and culture. It’s not just about expanding — it's about building a global community that shares the Nouns spirit.\n- **Franchise model as a public good**: Keeping in line with the CC0 spirit, we’ll be opening doors for property owners to become part of Villa Nouns, while ensuring quality through a rigorous review by our team.\n- **Decentralized ownership**: If the concept proves successful and Nouns DAO wishes to double down on the initiative, it will be possible for the DAO to own or co-own the estate.\n\n![3D Render](https://i.postimg.cc/wvz0Smvj/2-final.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## The nounish experience\n\n![Villa_Nouns_Gate.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/m2Zxzzn0/Villa-Nouns-Gate.jpg)\n\nReferences to many past and future Nouns projects will be integrated with the interiors of the villa and the surrounding natural environment. \n\nGuests will be able to read the Nouns comic, ride Gnars skateboards or surfboards, watch the Nouns movie, learn the history of Nouns, and more. Furthermore, holders of Nouns and derivatives will enjoy an even more personalised experience, customising screens and interiors of the villa based on their NFT holdings.\n\nCertain areas of the house like the bedrooms will be themed on specific Nouns or derivative collections. The overall experience will also evolve over time due to feedback and new projects in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nMost items at the villa will be Nouns themed, like towels, cutlery and home accessories, and some will also be gifted to guests. Among the nounish objects, furniture and decorations, we also plan to build suggestive stone mosaics and murals made by artists in the Nouns community. \n\n![_final.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/TPDBMryW/final.gif)\n\n**Booking and entering the villa**\n\n![main.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/cHc90Td6/main.jpg)\n\nGuests will be able to book the villa on Airbnb, or directly onchain through a custom booking website on [villanouns.wtf](http://villanouns.wtf).\n\nThe villa can be accessed by connecting the wallet on-site and verifying the purchase. Other wallets can also be appointed by the buyer to unlock the villa using delegate.cash.\n\n![iphone mock.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/BntdNW4p/iphone-mock.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## The villa and location\n\n![1.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/VLh7fJP9/1.jpg)\n\nVilla Nouns is an elegant villa located in Sardinia offering stunning views over the La Maddalena Archipelago, one of Italy's most coveted tourist destinations.\n\nThe spacious interior is designed for relaxation and focus, while the outdoor patio and large private garden are perfect for enjoying al fresco dining, relaxing in the Jacuzzi, or immersing in nature.\n\n![2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fy280LtN/2.jpg)\n\nThe villa includes a large living room with a sofa bed, four bedrooms (three with queen beds, two of which have en-suite bathrooms, and one with twin beds), and three bathrooms with hydromassage showers.\n\nFeatures a 1250 sqm garden, a heated four-person Jacuzzi, high-speed Starlink internet connection, heating and air conditioning, and private parking for up to two cars.\n\n![Villa_Nouns_Backyard.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/T2JM3qtV/Villa-Nouns-Backyard.jpg)\n\n**The location**\n\n![locations.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/htH3rfC4/locations.jpg)\n\nThe villa is located in the heart of Costa Smeralda between the picturesque port town Palau and the popular spot Roccia dell’Orso. Its prime location provides easy access to beautiful beaches and renowned attractions.\n\nThe spectacular Maddalena islands, are just a short boat ride away, while the prestigious Porto Cervo and Porto Rotondo are conveniently close, making it the perfect location to enjoy the most evocative places Sardinia has to offer.\n\nSee more on [villanouns.wtf/gallery](http://villanouns.wtf/gallery)\n\n**Financial aspects**\n\nThe villa has been rented out for several years, with rates between $50 and $110 per person per night based on the season.

We are often competing against traditional studio contracts for senior talent.\n  \n- Funding 3 episodes upfront will enable us to introduce batching of tasks for pre-production and animation, making the process much more predictable to manage. \n\n\n- More funding committed for the film will enable us to pre-empt discussions with distribution partners who will have a clearer picture of financing on the project and high likelihood of it being fully completed once they commit.\n\n---\n#### Where will the funds go to?\n- **Story and Scripting** for the Episode 3, 4 & 5 \n- **Preview Work in Progress and BTS** delivered through out the proposal duration\n- **Finished Episode 3,4 & 5** - delivered by 240 days time period.\n- Propdates published all along the way.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r19IfQTw3.png)\n\n\nAs we continue production, the timeline becomes more efficient and shrinks, ultimately leading us to the film conclusion. \n\n#### Kickoff Notes for EP3 onwards\n- After Episode 2 release, the team will be on a short hiatus for the rest of November (2 weeks).\n- Team ramps back up slowly throughout month of December and sporadic availability due to holiday month.\n- Expected to fully iron out EP3 script during this time period.\n- Team back at full capacity starting January and full production loop resumes. \n---\n\n### Recap and Progress Updates so far\nYou can follow Ep2 Propdates [here](https://www.updates.wtf/prop/317). \n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/2/2415348f7943c8a429024b648b3eb68b24a0d7fa_2_1380x862.jpeg)\n\n**Tl;dr:** Its bolder, bigger and better! \n\n\n#### Cast Announcements so far\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1zVh9NsW/19.png)\n\n- [Elijah Fox](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1701347725407838288) (Voice of Gi)\n- [Lisa Stanley](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1656100844763496448) (Voice of Mrs Waxman)\n- [Ray Hurd](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1710009700341928121) (Voice of Go)\n- [Cesar Romero](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1711863323967578591) (Voice of Leader blunt)\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/253cSV1K/environment-factory-hallyway.png)\n#### Behind the Scenes\n- [Discourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E_7XtzU47c&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation) with the directors : How Nouns Movie enabled them to do something unthinkable, completely remotely.\n- Understanding the intricacies of Blus [Musical Score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4OavIimoXs&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation).\n- Fun Trivia about the world [sound design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7umbTCiMTmk&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation) with Jordan - our SFX Lead.\n\n#### First Casting call\n- Casting call complete. 15 characters from other Nouns-values aligned communities were selected to make cameo appearances through out the Episode 2.\nhttps://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1686797509765840896\n- We intend to do more of these along to way opening the world of Blus outwards for others to participate in.\n\n#### Team Expansion Announcements\n- Dan Waters\nhttps://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1693785090340643078\n\n\n### DApp / UI Updates\n- **Nouns.Movie** was created to publish the story (dedicated webapp built with minting UX on top of Zora & cumulative leaderboard built-in)\n- Added Multi-episode support. \n- Introduced Worldview mints: Inexpensive art mints from different locations from the world of Blus that adds to cumulative ranking on the leaderboard.\n- Dedicated Behind the scenes section for audience to watch and explore auxillary content.\n- Planned token-gating for streaming content.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1Xd6YyB7/11111.png)\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/fTsHzvSg/2222.png)\n\n---\n\n### Story Updates\n**Genre**: Action, Comedy\n\nScript for the delivered Episode 2 can be found [***here***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gdInCNXaLvKA5Vrxe6aCTiOtE67jNpG6/view?usp=sharing)\n\n*We also created a rough outline of how the story progresses through completion.

[Ongoing Support and Maintenance](#ongoing-support-and-maintenance)\n\n---\n\n## 📖 Introduction\nA Unique Opportunity for Nouns Nouns DAO has a remarkable opportunity to fund an experience uniquely centered around Nouns. Focused primarily on engaging children, the app aims to be a playground where Nouns are at the core of fun, interactive, and educational activities. This will be achieved through a scavenger hunt, encouraging movement, exploration, and learning in a delightful manner.\n\nWe propose a funding request of 35,000 USDC to expand the Nouns Capture app, an interactive scavenger hunt that educates school-aged students globally about Nouns and key Web 3 concepts in a fun and engaging way. Currently available for iOS, our expansion plan includes developing an Android version of the app, a worldwide launch to tens of thousands of school students globally, and full connected curriculum integration.\n\n## 🌈 Nouns Doing Good: Witnessing Joy and Engagement Firsthand\n\nNouns, through the Nouns Capture app, have already begun to sprinkle the magic of joy and wonder into the lives of young explorers around the world. Our MVP has not just been a theoretical success; it’s been a playground where children’s faces light up with delight and curiosity as they engage in a universe filled with playful Nouns, embarking on adventures that fuse the real and digital worlds.\n\n![Engaged and delighted children navigating the world of Nouns Capture](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-11.57.53-am.png)\n\nFrom our hands-on experience, we've witnessed the authentic happiness and excitement that the Nouns Capture app brings to children. It’s not just about discovering and learning; it’s about igniting a passion for exploration and a love for an active, engaging, and joyful form of education, where each Noun becomes a cherished companion in their learning journey. For example students in Singapore using the Nouns capture app as part of a learning activity to learn about Nutrition and Menu planning. (see below)\n\n![enter image description here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FwWw7bpaIAchzny?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\nWe have a profound understanding of this realm and a clear vision of how to craft experiences that resonate with the hearts and minds of students globally. With Nouns at the core, the potential to unleash an even more captivating, enriching, and delightful educational adventures.\n\n\n---\n\n## 🏆 MVP Release and Success\nThe Nouns Capture app has already been released as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) on iOS and has received an overwhelmingly positive response. [Download Here](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nouns-capture/id6447956444?uo=2)  \n\nSo far, with a word-of-mouth silent launch, we've had 3522 Educational Downloads. This represents schools and educational institutions downloading the app to explore Nouns in their contexts. The MVP showcases the potential of the app as a powerful educational tool, with students across the globe in our beta audience actively engaging with the platform. This early success is a testament to the app's strong foundation, and we aim to build upon this momentum with the proposed expansion.\n\n![enter image description here](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-11.57.42-am.png)\n\n---\n\n## 🎮 How the App Works\nThe Nouns Capture app allows anyone to find and collect Nouns hidden within barcodes/QR codes in their real environments. By scanning these barcodes using the app, students unlock the hidden Nouns and can store them in their digital journal.  \n\nAs they progress through the game and collect more Nouns, students are also presented with opportunities to learn about Web 3 concepts. The app encourages exploration and learning in an engaging and interactive way, helping students gain a deeper understanding of the Nouns ecosystem and the broader principles of Web 3 technology.\n\n![enter image description here](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-11.57.48-am.png)\n\nWith absolutely no setup required, you can get started hunting Nouns and playing the base experience right now. Here I am finding Nouns in my local supermarket using the MVP version. \n\n![enter image description here](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ezgif.com-optimize-1.gif)\n\n\n---\n\n## 📈 Expansion Plan\n### 🤖 Android Development\nAs part of our expansion, we will develop an Android version of the Nouns Capture app to ensure maximum reach and accessibility. This will significantly increase the app's user base and allow students with Android devices to enjoy the same engaging educational experience as their iOS counterparts.\n\n### 🎨 UI Refinement: Unveiling a Nounish Aesthetic\nWhile our current app serves as a functional MVP with essential UI and UX features, it's merely a stepping stone to what we envision. We're excited to bring to life an elevated user interface that embodies a distinct Nounish aesthetic, complete with harmonious colors and fonts. This refined design aims to not only enhance user engagement but also to resonate deeply with our target audience.\n\n## 🌐 Evolving Playgrounds: Incorporating SubDAOs in the Nouns Capture Universe\n\nIn the next iteration of Nouns Capture, we plan to integrate various SubDAOs, making the experience more dynamic and engaging. Users will have the option to toggle between capturing different elements like Nouns, lil nouns, or gnars.\n\nThis inclusion allows for a broader, more diverse gameplay, offering a richer user experience while encouraging creativity and exploration. By doing this, we aim to unlock new possibilities and continuously evolve the game to meet and exceed user expectations.\n\n![Example of toggling between capturing various elements in the Nouns Capture app](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-21-at-2.56.05-pm-e1697860665424.png)\n\nOur inclusive approach aims to nurture a symbiotic relationship with SubDAOs, allowing them to infuse the game with their distinctive flavors, creatures, and narratives. This organic amalgamation aims to perpetuate an ever-evolving, rich, and engaging user experience, encouraging continuous exploration, learning, and fun.\n\n\n\n### 🏋️ Global Launch to 20,000 PE Teachers\nLaunching the Nouns Capture app is far from a ‘build it and they will come’ approach. We are not starting from scratch; instead, we are leveraging an established stronghold in a crucial educational niche.\n\n-   **Pre-established Audience:** We proudly host a robust audience, ready and waiting. Their presence guarantees that the app will not fall on deaf ears but will be eagerly embraced and incorporated into diverse learning environments.\n    \n-   **Teacher’s Influence:** Our network consists of 20,000 teachers, each a conduit of creativity and influence. Their involvement means tailored experiences crafted with expertise, ensuring the app's utility and engagement are maximized.\n    \n-   **Quantifying the Impact:** Let’s decipher the numbers - imagine each teacher on our list works with 100 students (its probably more than this), we are looking at a potential ripple effect of impact that helps proliferate nouns. \n    \n-   **Innovation and Authority:** Our reputation precedes us. With a history of delivering value, the Nouns Capture app is another innovative offering that the educational community will trust and adopt enthusiastically into their learning programs. \n    \nThis isn’t a hopeful venture into uncertainty. It is a strategic deployment of an innovative tool into a welcoming and prepared ecosystem, promising not just exposure, but meaningful engagement and expansive influence.\n\n### 📚 Integration with School Curricula\nOur audience of teachers appreciates turnkey solutions that provide immediate value in their classrooms. To make this possible, we develop world-class, curriculum-aligned lesson plans that can be easily implemented. Our goal is to seamlessly integrate the Nouns Capture app into school curricula worldwide. By incorporating the app into students' learning, we ensure they gain valuable knowledge about key Web 3 concepts and other core subject areas while engaging with the Nouns ecosystem in a fun and interactive manner.

[Move It](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/move-it/kopilngnmfklhhjocdfdlokmodibcbmk): A brain break Chrome extension for students with 98 million pageviews.\n 2. [Balance It](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/balance-it-task-cards/id630956844): An interactive mobile app for teaching gymnastics and balance skills, with over 1 million downloads.\n 3. [Sports Tracker](https://sportstrackerapp.com/): A school sports software with over 330,000 student accounts.  \n\nThese achievements demonstrate our dedication to creating and delivering high-quality experiences that resonate with students and educators worldwide, as well as our capacity to effectively reach & shape these audiences.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Nouns ROI: Benefits to the Nouns DAO\n### 🌍 Real-Life Proliferation of Nouns\nThe Nouns Capture app offers a unique opportunity to expand the Nouns brand's reach among the global school student body, targeting a vast and diverse audience. By launching the app to our network of 20,000 PE teachers, we will introduce thousands of students to the Nouns ecosystem. While many proposals focus on Web 3 users, we believe that true proliferation stems from making Nouns known in traditional contexts. Schools serve as an ideal avenue for genuine proliferation, as they bridge the gap between the digital world and everyday life, providing an immersive and educational experience for students to learn about and engage with the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n### 🤝 Engage the Next Generation\nThe World Economic Forum estimates that over 1 billion people will be using blockchain-based systems by 2030, and much of this future audience is currently in today's schools. By introducing Nouns and Web 3 to students early on, we can help cultivate a knowledgeable user base familiar with the Nouns ecosystem and contribute to the broader Web 3 community. We plan to do this via in-app education and interactive experiences.\n\n![enter image description here](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-11.58.09-am.png)\n\n---\n\n## 🎤 Nouns Capture at NFT Conferences and Events\nNouns Capture will be a valuable tool that can be leveraged at NFT conferences and events as an innovative and engaging way to educate attendees about Nouns and Lil Nouns. By utilizing Nouns Capture in these situations, we aim to create memorable experiences for participants and generate enthusiasm for the Nouns ecosystem.  \nHere's a simple scenario illustrating how Nouns Capture can be effectively utilized at NFT conferences and events:  \n- Attendees are informed about the Nouns Capture activity during the event's opening announcements or through promotional materials distributed before the event.\n- They are instructed to download the Nouns Capture app on their smartphones to participate in the activity.\n- The event organizers have strategically placed Nouns hidden within QR codes throughout the venue. These QR codes could be located at various points of interest, such as exhibits, booths, or food and beverage stations.\n- Attendees use the Nouns Capture app to scan and collect the hidden Nouns as they explore the venue and engage with the event's programming.\n- As they collect Nouns, participants also learn about Web 3 concepts and the Nouns ecosystem, further enhancing their understanding and connection to the Nouns brand.\n- Upon completion of the activity, attendees return to the Nouns booth to prove their captures by showing their in-app journal containing the collected Nouns.\n- Event organizers reward the participants with prizes, such as exclusive NFTs, merchandise, or event passes, creating a memorable and engaging experience for attendees.\n\n---\n\n## 💰 Budget Breakdown\nUI Refinement and Android Development (Nouns Capture): $15,000\nMarketing and Global Launch: $10,000\nCurriculum Integration and Content Development: $5,000\nOperations: $5,000 USDC\nTotal: 35,000 USDC\n\n---\n\n## 🗓️ Project Timeline: 4-Month Roadmap to Success\n### 📅 Months 1-2\n- 🎨 UI Refinement and Android Development for Nouns Capture\n### 📅 Months 3-4\n- 🎯 Finalize App Features and Integrations\n- 📚 Start Curriculum Integration and Content Development\n- 🚀 Begin Marketing and Global Launch preparations\n- 📚 Complete Curriculum Integration and Content Development\n- 🚀 Finalize Marketing and Global Launch preparations\n- 🌐 Nouns Capture App Global Launch\n- 🛠️ Operations commence\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Ongoing Support and Maintenance\nCreating and maintaining impactful educational experiences for students worldwide is at the heart of our business.

Focused primarily on engaging children, the app aims to be a playground where Nouns are at the core of fun, interactive, and educational activities. This will be achieved through a scavenger hunt, encouraging movement, exploration, and learning in a delightful manner.\n\nWe propose a funding request of 35,000 USDC to expand the Nouns Capture app, an interactive scavenger hunt that educates school-aged students globally about Nouns and key Web 3 concepts in a fun and engaging way. Currently available for iOS, our expansion plan includes developing an Android version of the app, a worldwide launch to tens of thousands of school students globally, and full connected curriculum integration.\n\n## 🌈 Nouns Doing Good: Witnessing Joy and Engagement Firsthand\n\nNouns, through the Nouns Capture app, have already begun to sprinkle the magic of joy and wonder into the lives of young explorers around the world. Our MVP has not just been a theoretical success; it’s been a playground where children’s faces light up with delight and curiosity as they engage in a universe filled with playful Nouns, embarking on adventures that fuse the real and digital worlds.\n\n![Engaged and delighted children navigating the world of Nouns Capture](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-11.57.53-am.png)\n\nFrom our hands-on experience, we've witnessed the authentic happiness and excitement that the Nouns Capture app brings to children. It’s not just about discovering and learning; it’s about igniting a passion for exploration and a love for an active, engaging, and joyful form of education, where each Noun becomes a cherished companion in their learning journey. For example students in Singapore using the Nouns capture app as part of a learning activity to learn about Nutrition and Menu planning. (see below)\n\n![enter image description here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FwWw7bpaIAchzny?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\nWe have a profound understanding of this realm and a clear vision of how to craft experiences that resonate with the hearts and minds of students globally. With Nouns at the core, the potential to unleash an even more captivating, enriching, and delightful educational adventures.\n\n\n---\n\n## 🏆 MVP Release and Success\nThe Nouns Capture app has already been released as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) on iOS and has received an overwhelmingly positive response. [Download Here](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nouns-capture/id6447956444?uo=2)  \n\nSo far, with a word-of-mouth silent launch, we've had 3522 Educational Downloads. This represents schools and educational institutions downloading the app to explore Nouns in their contexts. The MVP showcases the potential of the app as a powerful educational tool, with students across the globe in our beta audience actively engaging with the platform. This early success is a testament to the app's strong foundation, and we aim to build upon this momentum with the proposed expansion.\n\n![enter image description here](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-11.57.42-am.png)\n\n---\n\n## 🎮 How the App Works\nThe Nouns Capture app allows anyone to find and collect Nouns hidden within barcodes/QR codes in their real environments. By scanning these barcodes using the app, students unlock the hidden Nouns and can store them in their digital journal.  \n\nAs they progress through the game and collect more Nouns, students are also presented with opportunities to learn about Web 3 concepts. The app encourages exploration and learning in an engaging and interactive way, helping students gain a deeper understanding of the Nouns ecosystem and the broader principles of Web 3 technology.\n\n![enter image description here](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-11.57.48-am.png)\n\nWith absolutely no setup required, you can get started hunting Nouns and playing the base experience right now. Here I am finding Nouns in my local supermarket using the MVP version. \n\n![enter image description here](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ezgif.com-optimize-1.gif)\n\n\n---\n\n## 📈 Expansion Plan\n### 🤖 Android Development\nAs part of our expansion, we will develop an Android version of the Nouns Capture app to ensure maximum reach and accessibility. This will significantly increase the app's user base and allow students with Android devices to enjoy the same engaging educational experience as their iOS counterparts.\n\n### 🎨 UI Refinement: Unveiling a Nounish Aesthetic\nWhile our current app serves as a functional MVP with essential UI and UX features, it's merely a stepping stone to what we envision. We're excited to bring to life an elevated user interface that embodies a distinct Nounish aesthetic, complete with harmonious colors and fonts. This refined design aims to not only enhance user engagement but also to resonate deeply with our target audience.\n\n## 🌐 Evolving Playgrounds: Incorporating SubDAOs in the Nouns Capture Universe\n\nIn the next iteration of Nouns Capture, we plan to integrate various SubDAOs, making the experience more dynamic and engaging. Users will have the option to toggle between capturing different elements like Nouns, lil nouns, or gnars.\n\nThis inclusion allows for a broader, more diverse gameplay, offering a richer user experience while encouraging creativity and exploration. By doing this, we aim to unlock new possibilities and continuously evolve the game to meet and exceed user expectations.\n\n![Example of toggling between capturing various elements in the Nouns Capture app](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-21-at-2.56.05-pm-e1697860665424.png)\n\nOur inclusive approach aims to nurture a symbiotic relationship with SubDAOs, allowing them to infuse the game with their distinctive flavors, creatures, and narratives. This organic amalgamation aims to perpetuate an ever-evolving, rich, and engaging user experience, encouraging continuous exploration, learning, and fun.\n\n\n\n### 🏋️ Global Launch to 20,000 PE Teachers\nLaunching the Nouns Capture app is far from a ‘build it and they will come’ approach. We are not starting from scratch; instead, we are leveraging an established stronghold in a crucial educational niche.\n\n-   **Pre-established Audience:** We proudly host a robust audience, ready and waiting. Their presence guarantees that the app will not fall on deaf ears but will be eagerly embraced and incorporated into diverse learning environments.\n    \n-   **Teacher’s Influence:** Our network consists of 20,000 teachers, each a conduit of creativity and influence. Their involvement means tailored experiences crafted with expertise, ensuring the app's utility and engagement are maximized.\n    \n-   **Quantifying the Impact:** Let’s decipher the numbers - imagine each teacher on our list works with 100 students (its probably more than this), we are looking at a potential ripple effect of impact that helps proliferate nouns. \n    \n-   **Innovation and Authority:** Our reputation precedes us. With a history of delivering value, the Nouns Capture app is another innovative offering that the educational community will trust and adopt enthusiastically into their learning programs. \n    \nThis isn’t a hopeful venture into uncertainty. It is a strategic deployment of an innovative tool into a welcoming and prepared ecosystem, promising not just exposure, but meaningful engagement and expansive influence.\n\n### 📚 Integration with School Curricula\nOur audience of teachers appreciates turnkey solutions that provide immediate value in their classrooms. To make this possible, we develop world-class, curriculum-aligned lesson plans that can be easily implemented. Our goal is to seamlessly integrate the Nouns Capture app into school curricula worldwide. By incorporating the app into students' learning, we ensure they gain valuable knowledge about key Web 3 concepts and other core subject areas while engaging with the Nouns ecosystem in a fun and interactive manner.

[Move It](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/move-it/kopilngnmfklhhjocdfdlokmodibcbmk): A brain break Chrome extension for students with 98 million pageviews.\n 2. [Balance It](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/balance-it-task-cards/id630956844): An interactive mobile app for teaching gymnastics and balance skills, with over 1 million downloads.\n 3. [Sports Tracker](https://sportstrackerapp.com/): A school sports software with over 330,000 student accounts.  \n\nThese achievements demonstrate our dedication to creating and delivering high-quality experiences that resonate with students and educators worldwide, as well as our capacity to effectively reach & shape these audiences.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Nouns ROI: Benefits to the Nouns DAO\n### 🌍 Real-Life Proliferation of Nouns\nThe Nouns Capture app offers a unique opportunity to expand the Nouns brand's reach among the global school student body, targeting a vast and diverse audience. By launching the app to our network of 20,000 PE teachers, we will introduce thousands of students to the Nouns ecosystem. While many proposals focus on Web 3 users, we believe that true proliferation stems from making Nouns known in traditional contexts. Schools serve as an ideal avenue for genuine proliferation, as they bridge the gap between the digital world and everyday life, providing an immersive and educational experience for students to learn about and engage with the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n### 🤝 Engage the Next Generation\nThe World Economic Forum estimates that over 1 billion people will be using blockchain-based systems by 2030, and much of this future audience is currently in today's schools. By introducing Nouns and Web 3 to students early on, we can help cultivate a knowledgeable user base familiar with the Nouns ecosystem and contribute to the broader Web 3 community. We plan to do this via in-app education and interactive experiences.\n\n![enter image description here](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-11.58.09-am.png)\n\n---\n\n## 🎤 Nouns Capture at NFT Conferences and Events\nNouns Capture will be a valuable tool that can be leveraged at NFT conferences and events as an innovative and engaging way to educate attendees about Nouns and Lil Nouns. By utilizing Nouns Capture in these situations, we aim to create memorable experiences for participants and generate enthusiasm for the Nouns ecosystem.  \nHere's a simple scenario illustrating how Nouns Capture can be effectively utilized at NFT conferences and events:  \n- Attendees are informed about the Nouns Capture activity during the event's opening announcements or through promotional materials distributed before the event.\n- They are instructed to download the Nouns Capture app on their smartphones to participate in the activity.\n- The event organizers have strategically placed Nouns hidden within QR codes throughout the venue. These QR codes could be located at various points of interest, such as exhibits, booths, or food and beverage stations.\n- Attendees use the Nouns Capture app to scan and collect the hidden Nouns as they explore the venue and engage with the event's programming.\n- As they collect Nouns, participants also learn about Web 3 concepts and the Nouns ecosystem, further enhancing their understanding and connection to the Nouns brand.\n- Upon completion of the activity, attendees return to the Nouns booth to prove their captures by showing their in-app journal containing the collected Nouns.\n- Event organizers reward the participants with prizes, such as exclusive NFTs, merchandise, or event passes, creating a memorable and engaging experience for attendees.\n\n---\n\n## 💰 Budget Breakdown\nUI Refinement and Android Development (Nouns Capture): $15,000\nMarketing and Global Launch: $10,000\nCurriculum Integration and Content Development: $5,000\nOperations: $5,000 USDC\nTotal: 35,000 USDC\n\n---\n\n## 🗓️ Project Timeline: 4-Month Roadmap to Success\n### 📅 Months 1-2\n- 🎨 UI Refinement and Android Development for Nouns Capture\n### 📅 Months 3-4\n- 🎯 Finalize App Features and Integrations\n- 📚 Start Curriculum Integration and Content Development\n- 🚀 Begin Marketing and Global Launch preparations\n- 📚 Complete Curriculum Integration and Content Development\n- 🚀 Finalize Marketing and Global Launch preparations\n- 🌐 Nouns Capture App Global Launch\n- 🛠️ Operations commence\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Ongoing Support and Maintenance\nCreating and maintaining impactful educational experiences for students worldwide is at the heart of our business.

With blockchain tech, we can expand these elements, showcasing not just today's aesthetics but also the timeless stories within our community that will stand strong for years to come.\n\n\n---\n\n## **A Graphic Novel (Vol 1)**.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkNjEYyzT.png)\n*Draft Cover/Poster*\n\nI’m targeting Graphic Novel readers (15+) who love both sci-fi and fantasy + adventure, usually read action-packed stories, but also love tech, and (included but not limited) are crypto users.\nThe graphic novel will include concepts related to decentralization, blockchain, and internet technologies, and will show how Nouns live in this interesting universe.\n\nI firmly believe that we can find the right audience in Web3 at first, it’s an amazing niche to build a tech-oriented story and ultimately an onchain mythology, in which Nouns could be not only at the core of it but represent great values and a positive-sum culture.\n\nTo me, nouns are not only pixel characters, but something more, they are storytelling vehicles full of potential. And at the same time, there are dozens of small elements in our community lore to include in the story. \n\n---\n\n## **Evolution of the Nouns aesthetics (from my POV):**\nWe all love the original Nouns, they are perfect as the source material, but they are also really adaptable to using them in different styles.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyPczHAWa.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ-R9gHga.png)\n*The last two images are from April-June 2022.*\n\n In this world-building adventure, I've given the term \"Noun\" a fresh perspective, digging into its meaning both on the surface and at a deeper, symbolic level. This project isn't just about testing how Nouns look; it's also about spinning an engaging tale. We want to hook current Noun fans and introduce new readers to our world, even if they're not blockchain or DAO experts.\n \n---\n\n## **Distribution:**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJE-Pclfa.png)\nDraft Cover.\n\n**Digital First:**\nThe main distribution strategy will be online (Free download from the website, manga/comic reader apps like Comixology, Viz Media, Kindle, and P2P/torrents).\nMost of the dedicated comic reader apps have more than 500K users minimum, but in the case of bigger apps like Comixology or Viz Media, they have millions of users combined in both the App Store and Google Store.\n\n**Physical:**\nPhysical copies will be handled through Amazon (highly efficient, global coverage, and no upfront costs). Plus, in case we can make a deal with regional publishers, it's easy to shut down the distribution of a translated version directly on Amazon.\n\n\n**4 Languages:**\nEnglish, Spanish, Japanese, and French. \n\nI cannot emphasize enough the significance of translating the graphic novel. Translating the artwork can create opportunities for publication by one or multiple publishers in Europe, Asia, or North America. Since many major publishers prefer to review a complete work, and this being the first volume, it could serve as an ideal means to engage regional publishers worldwide.\n\n\n---\n\n## **Concept Art:**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJoFWSRZT.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJYtXrR-a.png)\n\n---\n## **Summary of the story (subject to changes):**\n\n\nMeet Shady, a Noun who doesn't quite fit the mold of an obedient or exemplary citizen in a world teeming with adventurers, mysteries, and high achievers. His existence is a quiet rebellion in a society that prizes conformity. However, it seems destiny, if it exists, has grander designs for Shady. His insatiable curiosity catapults him into the uncharted territories of unexplored worlds.\n\nAs Shady embarks on this enigmatic journey, it becomes clear that more than just his life is at stake. The fate of his entire kind rests on his shoulders, and time is of the essence. He's faced with a dilemma: will he seize this opportunity to change the course of history or let it slip through his fingers?\n\n\n\n## **Sample Pages**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryDRkBRWp.png)\n\n\n## **Characters from the first volume:**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk-7xu1zp.png)\n\n**Featuring the NounBots:**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJVbJ9xza.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1nzkqeMa.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkRmycgM6.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Building in Public:**\n\nI’m also building a graphic style to present the development of the project to the public in a more entertaining way using videos and/or live streams. This way people can follow more closely the development of the graphic novel and can ask questions about nouns and their ecosystem.\n\nThe goal is to make 2 videos per week (1 to 2 hours each) showing the process of the Graphic Novel, the idea is to use Twitch or YouTube (ideally both).\nI can also use propdates.wtf to show the latest news of the prop and the Manga channel in Farcaster.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyO0trwWa.png)\n*This is a sample of how the videos could look like*.\n\n---\n\n## **Scope and Budget**:\nSince this is a graphic novel of 64 pages I will need around 10 to 12 months to finish it.\nThe ideal deadline would be the next Nouniversary and I’ll push myself and the team involved to do so, but I’m organizing the dates including all the team efforts and the standard timeframes to make the deadline more realistic so it could be released in October/November next year.\n\n\n---\n## **Budget Breakdown:**\n\n- **Preproduction - 8 eth**\n  - World Building\n  - Concept art \n  - Environment design\n  - Character Sheets\n  - Props Design \n- **Script - 8 eth**\n- **Art Development - 29 eth**\n  - Layouts - 6 eth\n  - Pencils - 8 eth\n  - Inks + Screentones - 11 eth\n  - Lettering + VFX/SFX - 4 eth\n- **Editorial - 6 eth**\n  - Proofreading and formatting for each language.\n  - Title and character/localization.\n- **Translation - 8 eth**\n  - Japanese, French, Spanish.\n- **Marketing - 15 eth**\n  - Contests / Collaborations\n  - Promoted content inside specialized comic websites/forums.\n  - Extra collectibles: Wallpapers (desktop and mobile), Open Editions, etc.\n  - Promotional video.\n- **Management - 10 eth.**\n- **Website - 6 eth**\n### **Total= 90 eth + Noun 81***\n\n*I would need some extra help with the transfer of the Noun in case the DAO accepts the request.\n\n---\n## **It's a me, Messhup!**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Syxp3uJfa.jpg)\n\n\nI've been officially building with Nouns since November 2021, and since then my life changed completely.\n\nNot only I’ve made amazing friends in these 2 years but also collaborated with several SubDAOs and teams like TNS, SharkDAO, GnarsDAO, LilNouns, POAP, Bankless, and many more. Outside of Web3, I’ve worked with Adidas, ExxonMobil, Penguin Random House, LEGO, and more to come.\n\nI have more than 10 years as an illustrator and I feel confident executing this prop, not only because is in my wheelhouse, but also because I've been part of the Nouniverse since the beginning and know the culture, inside jokes and small details that can be easter eggs in this graphic novel. I also have previous experience publishing books, and thanks to the DAO I self-publish [**100 Days of Nouns**](https://nounsense.xyz/), in just 6 months! (2022).\n\n---\n**Got Questions?**\nI have a separate doc highlighting some of the possible questions I could receive for this prop and will be updating the doc during the voting period.

The proposal is already out and frozen for now. \n---\n#### We're looking for more feedback here.\n---\n\n## 📋 Executive Summary:\nAs the proud owner of Nouns 312, I am deeply impressed by the vision and expansion strategy behind [NounsDeli](https://nouns.wtf/vote/254) and [NounsBuilder Protocol](https://nouns.wtf/vote/167). I propose an initial investment of 312 ETH into the newly formed \"Nouns House DAO,\" which will be a rebranding of the current Enabler DAO. This investment aims to fortify and grow the entire Nouns ecosystem. This proposal also represents the Initial NFT Offering (INO) of Nouns House DAO.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to evolve Nouns House into a platform similar to Airbnb, allowing users to easily rent out their homes. What sets this platform apart is the featuring of Nouns characters, adding a unique layer of branding and engagement. Moreover, Nouns House aims to offer lower fees than Airbnb, making it a more cost-effective option for users.\n\nThis new initiative has high synergy potential with existing property rental platform development projects, promising innovative value through the utilization of smart contracts and NFTs.\n\n## 🔍 What is Enabler DAO?\n\nEnabler DAO is a Tokyo-based decentralized autonomous organization founded by Yuki Hamada, a serial tech entrepreneur and a former executive CPO of Mercari, a unicorn company in Japan. The organization specializes in developing property rental platforms using smart contracts and manages high-end properties in Tokyo, Hawaii, Kyoto, and Hokkaido. Given its successful real estate ventures and its profit-generating business model, Enabler DAO is at a pivotal stage, transitioning into tokenization. This evolution marks the birth of Enabler DAO as a key player in the blockchain and real estate space. Additionally, it is planning to introduce special benefits for NFT holders, such as the ability to rent available properties at discounted rates, leveraging its expertise and existing assets to foster new growth opportunities.\n\n## ❓ Why Approve This Proposal?\n\n- **Beyond Art**: Nouns is more than just an art project; it functions as the foundation for a new decentralized protocol. Nouns House DAO is one example, making this not just a proposal but an extension of the Nouns ecosystem. It offers growth and innovation opportunities for both communities.\n\n- **Established and Audited**: Nouns House DAO has already been launched and is built with the security-audited NounsBuilder.\n\n- **Initial Benchmark Price**: The 312 ETH allocation has the potential to serve as an initial benchmark price. In return, 1/20th of the founders' share will be allocated to nouns.eth, bringing economic benefits to the Nouns community.\n\n- **Treasury Allocation**: The 312 ETH will be transferred to the Nouns House DAO's treasury, to be utilized for various initiatives in a DAO-governed manner.\n\n- **Future Valuation**: In the 15 days leading up to approval, the next treasury could exceed the current average price of Nouns, indicating high future potential for the project.\n\n- **Momentum from 15-Day Window**: If approved within 15 days, the treasury price per NFT would increase by 20.8 ETH (312/15), adding momentum to Nouns House DAO.\n\n- **Setting a Good Precedent**: This approach could set a good precedent for future DAOs and projects, strengthening the decentralized ecosystem and serving as a model for how existing projects can evolve symbiotically.\n\n## 🆕 New Features to Consider\n  \n- **Artwork and Rewards**: Nouns House will have special tokens based on different combinations of Nouns artwork like houses🏠, earth🌏, and islands🌴.\n  \n- **Property Contributions**: I personally own seven properties worth about $10 million, which will be part of Nouns House.  Instagram page [Enabler.Fun](https://www.instagram.com/enabler.fun/).\n\n- **Legal Hurdles**: We recognize that transferring physical property into digital assets is complicated and will tread carefully.\n\n## 🗳 Approval and Bidding Process\n\n- **For Nouns Holders**: Vote and bid [here](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0x7F4Ec49a66D773D63092dbD8FbCDFC71C9D9e2f3).\n\n- **For Non-Holders**: The auction is live! Start bidding from 0 ETH [here](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0x7F4Ec49a66D773D63092dbD8FbCDFC71C9D9e2f3).\n\n- **Treasury & Governance**: The 312 ETH allocation will be governed by votes from NFTs won in the auctions and from nouns.eth shared treasury.\n\n## 📌 Nouns House DAO Details:\n- **Token:** 0x7F4Ec49a66D773D63092dbD8FbCDFC71C9D9e2f3\n- **Auction:** 0xF5d1403dcbB1A2d5FaAD65BeBfaaB3870D7fe047\n- **Treasury:** 0x1C99D1e81772aFF2eD0ABC802AA571B19cE2d72B\n- **Governor:** 0x1393f1b1B4eA06e2019ad2BFf498b1C46Ad5c706\n- **Metadata:** 0x29F538d3EF89fDFB38A41098bF6604F4aFDFE8ec\n\n## 🎉 Conclusion:\nApproval of this proposal will significantly benefit not just our initiative but the Nouns ecosystem at large.

We believe this protocol is poised to bring significant advancements to the ecosystem.\nWe propose an initial investment of 312 ETH into the newly established \"Nouns House DAO.\" (originally conceived as an Enabler DAO). \nThe primary objective of this investment is to further fortify and expand the Nouns ecosystem. Specifically, we aim to evolve the platform to enable homeowners to easily rent out their properties by integrating smart locks, specialized rental apps, and issuing NFT keys. Moreover, the branding will incorporate Nouns characters, and the use of blockchain technology will ensure an open and transparent operation. Ultimately, we aim to offer lower fees compared to existing platforms and deliver value to users through a token ecosystem.\nAs a return on this investment, we propose allocating 10% of the token supply to nouns.eth. This could potentially bring long-term benefits to the Nouns ecosystem. This initiative is highly synergistic with existing property rental platform development projects and promises innovative value through the use of smart contracts and NFTs.\nFeedback and opinions are more than welcome. Feel free to contact me directly through my social media accounts on Warpcast or X link, or leave your comments here. We look forward to your valuable insights. Thank you.\n\n## 🔍 What is Enabler DAO/LLC?\nFounded by Yuki Hamada, a serial tech entrepreneur and former Executive CPO of Mercari, a unicorn company in Japan, Enabler DAO/LLC is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). To accommodate scenarios requiring formal contracts, it also holds a legal entity status in Japan in the form of an LLC, which participates as a member of the DAO. The organization currently manages luxury properties across Tokyo, Hawaii, Kyoto, and Hokkaido, operating with a profitable business model in the real estate sector. It is also in a transitional phase towards tokenization. As this investment progresses, Nouns House DAO has the potential to emerge as a key player at the intersection of blockchain and real estate.

Looking forward to your thoughts!\n\n---\n\n*“Is Nouns activity growing?” “Who is helping increase engagement and spreading the meme?” “Which proposals are driving growth?” “What’s our spend rate?” “How many builders are contributing to the Nouns ecosystem?” “Are the amount of proposal candidates increasing?”*\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\nWe aim to create a single-purpose website where Nouns activity metrics are published. It will integrate activity across social channels and highlight which Nouns, advocates, and proposals have best supported the Noun’s meme propagation. Our creative motto is: *Track Memes, Not People.*\n\nAs a starting point, this proposal focuses on [1] onchain activity (supported by the Nouns subgraph), [2] two sources of social media (Farcaster and Instagram), and [3] a limited set of metrics — such as proposal submissions, votes, comments, posts, and engagement. Opportunistically, we will incorporate additional sources and expand the set of metrics.\n\n## Background\n\nAs of the moment, the Nouns’ community and audience members produce a wide variety of data. Over time, more data is likely to migrate onchain (e.g. similar to vote comments today) and data will be produced across even more digital localities. The *United World of Nouns* will have a wide-ranging data footprint. Combining data across these localities can become a powerful tool for proposal development and decision-making.\n\nHowever, as @Krel mentioned in their [Request for Proposers](https://www.notion.so/Nouns-DAO-Request-for-Proposers-94dadff999ac493b9902aa002e4b296e?pvs=21):\n\n> *“Nouns DAO does not have a reliable way to measure ‘growth’ or ‘success’. Its not clear what should be measured, or what growth in the context of Nouns even means.”*\n> \n\nThis project will create an initial repository of activity growth combining onchain and offchain data. We are long overdue to experiment on this front!\n\n## Scope\n\nThe metrics tracker will be in the form of a single-purpose web application.\n\nTo begin, we will include onchain data available in the Nouns Subgraph and two social media channels: Farcaster and Instagram. We will publish a selection of core metrics that provide clarity to Noun holders and the wider community.\n\nMost importantly, the underlying data pool (Meme Activity Database) will serve a first step towards a data-driven Nouns culture, which community members and potential builders can use to find opportunities for proposal submissions.\n\nSuccess of this project will be measured based on web application usage (unique visitors), proposal references (e.g. This project will increase X metric supporting Noun activity growth), and data pool connections (e.g. external usage of the Meme Activity Database).\n\nAs a stretch goal, we will look to expand the data sources, for example including key derivative NFT projects (Gnars, LilNouns, cc0-lib) and other dominant social spaces (Discord, Discourse, X, Lens, etc).\n\n*Note: X (formerly Twitter) has been deprioritized due to its cost ($5k per month) until initiative is proven useful. It would be included in future proposals.*\n\n*Note: Discord has been deprioritized due to its fragmentation (there multiple Nouns servers) until initiative is proven useful. It would be included in future proposals.*\n\n## Product Components\n\n### \n\nWhenever we want to test our internet speed, we can easily go to a speed test website. If we want to see how our activity on X (formerly Twitter), we can go to profile analytics. \n\n**Where do we go to check how the Nouns ecosystem is growing?** We go to *.*\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByD5JEHfp.png)\n\nThe Pulse is a single purpose website showcasing onchain and offchain activity metrics. This includes public conversations related to the **********************United World of Nouns.********************** The main graph, which we are currently calling *“Activity Momentum”* will showcase daily activity growth, a proxy for the Noun meme adoption and mind-share online.\n\nOur data analytics approach will combine methodologies from (1) traditional media broadcasting (e.g. combining data like number of views, replies, likes, proposal submissions, unique voters, etc.), (2) crypto-native metrics common across DAOs, and (3) materials science and engineering (read more about how engineers develop [material selection indexes here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_selection)).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJSJgVrGp.png)\n\nData will be synchronized in real-time directly from the Nouns’ Subgraph, Farcaster, Instagram to an SQL database. The sync mechanism will be architected in a uniform adapter interface for easier future integration with other onchain data and offchain sources, such as Twitter, Discourse, Discord, Telegram, DeSo, and Lens.\n\n**Example Onchain Metrics:**\n\n- Treasury\n- Treasury Usage Rate (Monthly Spend)\n- Burn Value\n- Candidate Props Growth\n- Proposal Submissions Growth\n- Active Proposals\n- Percent of Proposals Funded\n- Total Unique Builders\n- Average Auction Price\n\n**Example Offchain Metrics:**\n\n- Number of Posts\n- Total Engagement (Likes+Comments+Shares)\n- Engagement Rate (Ratio of Engagement to Posts)\n- Most Engaged Content\n- Total Followers\n- Follower Growth Rate (Updated based on API opportunity)\n- Noggles Score: Count of posts using “⌐◨-◨” on Farcaster*\n\n**In the first phase it won’t be possible to index Instagram posts by content, only be hashtags. As a result, the Noggles Score won’t be able to include Instagram posts.*\n\n### Meme Activity Database (a.k.a. The MAD)\n\nCurcially, the product’s underlying data model will be available for others to query and contribute to. That way, others can embed the index into their own Noun interfaces. Anyone should be able to get clean and reliable **meme-data-as-a-service** to support a diversity of Noun initiatives. Imagine a world where active proposals have conversation hype trackers, or ongoing projects can easily see total impressions across social media channels.\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to facilitate the use of data across the Nouns ecosystem. As the cc0 library enables media usage, the activity database enables tracking and impact analysis.\n\nThe Web API interface will be available publicly in the form of parametrizable JSON endpoints. The data will be distributed per specific sources (onchain Nouns, Farcaster, and others) as well as in aggregated form to enable the development of tools such as alerts, bots, and analytics dashboards.\n\n## Product Roadmap\n\nThe execution of this project will be done in an iterative fashion. By building in public and getting ongoing feedback, we can deliver what the community needs, and data that will support Nouns decisions.\n\n**Iterative Phases:**\n\n- **Phase 1:** Deliver basic UI w/ limited branding and processed Farcaster data displayed in form of metrics. Deliver mock-up UI for onchain metrics and Instagram metrics. Host open Q&A with Nouns (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 2:** Deliver basic UI w/ Farcaster metric feedback, plus Noun Subgraph indexing and onchain metrics. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 3:** Deliver basic UI w/ Farcaster, Onchain metric feedback, and Instagram metrics for specific accounts and hashtags. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 4:** Complete UI polishing and metrics calibration. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to celebrate launch and discuss future opportunities (where next).\n\n## An Ambitious Vision\n\nThis project aims to uncover what “Nouns-Native” analytics could look like, and what data infrastructure is necessary to feed this analytics into the broader Nouns governance and participation process.\n\nWe’ve already intuited that we want to ***Track*** ***Memes, Not People*** — and we’re certain there will be other innovations along the way. After all, we need to address challenges in crossing the web3-to-web2 data pipeline chasm. Is it possible? We think so.\n\nNouns is a place for ambitious ideas, and we are an ambitious team.\n\n## Team\n\nThis project will be led and executed by Rafa Fernandez (Farcaster: @rafa) and Rafi Gutkowski (Farcaster: @rafi). \n\n- Rafa Fernandez is a community architect with a focus on building [Digital Public Utilities](https://www.notion.so/General-Networks-e4615b9b52294f8bab34a82b47023d11?pvs=21). He has decade of experience in corporate analytics and studied materials-science and engineering. He is the founder of Folklore (Folklore.Institute), a community that curates and commissions research on digital cultures. Most recently, he was part of the Summer of Protocols research program looking at [online swarms](https://www.notion.so/Welcome-to-the-Swarm-41c114211ac045f087c44c16bd993748?pvs=21). Previous to the program he worked at Mirror where he worked in creator partnerships and community development.\n- Rafi Gutkowski is a software engineer and data scientist ([libred.org](https://libred.org/), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/rgutkowski)). He started mining bitcoin in 2015 but only after exiting from his recent startup, did he double down on web3. Since then Rafi has been working on sementic analysis of decentralized social graphs, as well as creating web3-web2 bridges, such as Folklore’s web3-signature to feed [broadcast applet](https://www.notion.so/Folklore-5d34757913064064b87119c4593eda74?pvs=21).\n\n## Funding\n\nWe are a stream of 22.5 ETH to fund this project over approximately 10 weeks.\n\nThe funds will be allocated to a two-person team (Rafa and Rafi). They are split roughly 25-75 between planning and iterative engineering. There is about a 40-40-10 between data engineering, visuals and handoff. There is approximately 10% reserved for bugs and issue resolution.\n\nWe expect that once the initial traunch of data engineering and visuals is complete, then we can make a decision on what the community needs more of (if anything), such as expanded data, or expanded analysis\n\n## Our Commitments\n\n- We commit to posting updates on [updates.wtf](https://updates.wtf/) with sprint plan and outcomes, in alignment with each of the community Q&A feedback sessions.\n- We commit to cancelling the stream based on community feedback.\n- We commit to executing this work as an open-source project, such that other onchain communities and organizations can benefit.\n\n## Other Notes\n\nThis proposal was built based on the Basic Nouns Proposal Template, built by Rafa and available here: https://hackmd.io/@rafathebuilder/BkPAmHZbp\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about this proposal, the first Q&A conversation on Aburra is available here: https://youtu.be/_dr2yZulMG","slug":"the-noun-pulse","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0x1f6c184ea134cdc87bf48b289de1d38ddeaf356ec47b549f04c32dfd6d67e5da","reason":""},{"blockNumber":18420841,"blockHash":"0xbe6e1f00d683259772a3aa16b805d5cb9edd497721a4df90afaeb1a0ece02162","transactionIndex":99,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0xa3396f0d04bd39345346cdacbd34d2b2b6d3950531e11029568b5dd14ce0f739","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0x1BdE33DBc5c2ac7109c4A7eCF0D0A0a6CD6f57cc","targets":["0x1d8C3778F3E42B6BcF3D279C40716CEE0C0757Bd"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"description":"# 🏠 Nouns House DAO\n\n# 📋 Executive Summary:\nHe Nouns 312 owner is excited about the NounsBuilder Protocol's impact on the Nouns ecosystem and proposes a 312 ETH investment in the new \"Nouns House DAO.\" This project aims to revolutionize property rentals using smart locks, apps, NFT keys, and Nouns branding, ensuring lower fees and transparent blockchain operations.

To accommodate scenarios requiring formal contracts, it also holds a legal entity status in Japan in the form of an LLC, which participates as a member of the DAO. The organization currently manages luxury properties across Tokyo, Hawaii, Kyoto, and Hokkaido, operating with a profitable business model in the real estate sector. It is also in a transitional phase towards tokenization. As this investment progresses, Nouns House DAO has the potential to emerge as a key player at the intersection of blockchain and real estate. Furthermore, plans are in motion to issue utility tokens based on the existing property usage, offering special perks to NFT owners. This includes the strategy to leverage existing assets to stimulate new avenues for growth.\n\n## ❓ Why Approve This Proposal?\n\n### Beyond Art 🎭🌐\n- Direct Ownership and Governance in Real Estate: Engaging in community-based property ownership extends beyond financial returns, fostering a sense of communal identity and solidarity. This collective approach enables members to create spaces that reflect their shared values and aesthetics, enhancing the cultural and emotional significance of the properties. It also encourages cooperative decision-making, where members participate in shaping the community environments, from planning events to establishing communal spaces that host cultural, educational, or recreational activities. Moreover, this shared ownership model cultivates a platform for social interaction, allowing individuals to connect, collaborate, and build meaningful relationships, thereby enriching the community's social fabric. This strategy not only empowers individuals through direct involvement in real estate management but also nurtures a sense of belonging and collective purpose that transcends mere financial gain.\n\n### Established and Audited 🛡🔍\n- Nouns House DAO has already been launched and is built with the security-audited NounsBuilder.\n\n### Initial Benchmark Price 💰📈\n- The 312 ETH allocation has the potential to serve as an initial benchmark price. In return, 1/20th of the founders' share will be allocated to nouns.eth.\n\n### Budget and Allocation 💼🗳\n- The 312 ETH will be transferred to the Nouns House DAO's treasury, to be utilized for various initiatives in a DAO-governed manner.\n\n### Future Valuation 📊🔮\n- In the 15 days leading up to approval, the next treasury could exceed the current average price of Nouns, indicating high future potential for the project.\n\n### Momentum from 15-Day Window 🌪⏳\n- If approved within 15 days, the treasury price per NFT would increase by 20.8 ETH (312/15), adding momentum to Nouns House DAO.\n\n### Setting a Good Precedent 📜🌟\n- This approach could set a good precedent for future DAOs and projects, strengthening the decentralized ecosystem and serving as a model for how existing projects can evolve symbiotically.\n\n### Approval and Participation Mechanism 🗳👥\n- These points will be decided upon approval by Nouns House DAO.

Distribution will be digital and physical, with plans for translation in 4 Languages. The project development will be shared through videos, live streams, and Open Editions, aiming for completion in 10-12 months.\n\n---\n\n## **A Graphic Novel (Vol 1)**.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkNjEYyzT.png)\n*Draft Cover/Poster*\n\nI’m targeting Graphic Novel readers (15+) who love both sci-fi and fantasy + adventure, usually read action-packed stories, but also love tech, and (included but not limited) are crypto users. The artwork will include concepts related to decentralization, blockchain, and internet technologies, and Nouns will be the characters that inhabit this universe.\n\nI firmly believe that we can find the right audience in Web3 at first, it’s an amazing niche to build a tech-oriented story and ultimately an onchain mythology, in which Nouns could be not only at the core of it but represent great values and a positive-sum culture.\n\nTo me, nouns are not only pixel characters, but something more, they are storytelling vehicles full of potential. And at the same time, there are dozens of small elements in our community lore to include in the story. \n\n---\n\n## **Evolution of the Nouns aesthetics (from my POV):**\nWe all love the original Nouns, they are perfect as the source material, but they are also really adaptable to using them in different styles.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyPczHAWa.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ-R9gHga.png)\n*The last two images are from April-June 2022.*\n\n In this world-building adventure, I've given the term \"Noun\" a fresh perspective, digging into its meaning both on the surface and at a deeper, symbolic level. This project isn't just about testing how Nouns look; it's also about spinning an engaging tale. We want to hook current Noun fans and introduce new readers to our world, even if they're not blockchain or DAO experts.\n \n---\n\n## **Distribution:**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJE-Pclfa.png)\nDraft Cover.\n\n**Digital First:**\nThe main distribution strategy will be online (Free download from the website, manga/comic reader apps like Comixology, Viz Media, Kindle, and P2P/torrents).\nMost of the dedicated comic reader apps have more than 500K users minimum, but in the case of bigger apps like Comixology or Viz Media, they have millions of users combined in both the App Store and Google Store.\n\n**Physical:**\nPhysical copies will be handled through Amazon (highly efficient, global coverage, and no upfront costs). Plus, in case we can make a deal with regional publishers, it's easy to shut down the distribution of a translated version directly on Amazon.\n\n\n**4 Languages:**\nEnglish, Spanish, Japanese, and French. \n\nI cannot emphasize enough the significance of translating the graphic novel. Translating the artwork can create opportunities for publication by one or multiple publishers in Europe, Asia, or North America. Since many major publishers prefer to review a complete work, and this being the first volume, it could serve as an ideal means to engage regional publishers worldwide.\n\n\n---\n\n## **Concept Art:**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJoFWSRZT.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJYtXrR-a.png)\n\n---\n## **Summary of the story (subject to changes):**\n\n\nMeet Shady, a Noun who doesn't quite fit the mold of an obedient or exemplary citizen in a world teeming with adventurers, mysteries, and high achievers. His existence is a quiet rebellion in a society that prizes conformity. However, it seems destiny, if it exists, has grander designs for Shady. His insatiable curiosity catapults him into the uncharted territories of unexplored worlds.\n\nAs Shady embarks on this enigmatic journey, it becomes clear that more than just his life is at stake. The fate of his entire kind rests on his shoulders, and time is of the essence. He's faced with a dilemma: will he seize this opportunity to change the course of history or let it slip through his fingers?\n\n\n\n## **Sample Pages**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryDRkBRWp.png)\n\n\n## **Characters from the first volume:**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk-7xu1zp.png)\n\n**Featuring the NounBots:**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJVbJ9xza.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1nzkqeMa.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkRmycgM6.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Building in Public + Key Milestones:**\n\nI’m also building a graphic style to present the development of the project to the public in a more entertaining way using videos and/or live streams. This way people can follow more closely the development of the graphic novel and can ask questions about nouns and their ecosystem.\n\nThe goal is to make 2 videos per week (1 to 2 hours each) showing the process of the Graphic Novel, the idea is to use Twitch or YouTube (ideally both).\nI can also use propdates.wtf to show the latest news of the prop and the Manga channel in Farcaster.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyO0trwWa.png)\n*This is a sample of how the videos could look like*.\n\n## Key Milestones:\n\n**Concept and Team (Months 1-3):**\nDevelop the storyline and artistic style.\nAssemble and prepare the creative team.\n\n**Production and Marketing (Months 4-10):**\nCreate the 64-page graphic novel while translating it into multiple languages.\nImplement marketing and promotion strategies on online platforms.\n\n**Distribution and Launch (Month 11-12):**\nPlan and execute the distribution strategy for both digital and physical copies.\nOfficially launch the graphic novel, including online and potentially in-person events.\n\n**Audience Engagement and Public Building (Ongoing):**\nContinuously engage with the community on various platforms.\nAdapt the project based on audience feedback and reception.\n\n**Global Expansion and Future Planning (Ongoing):**\nStart the conversations with external publishers to get the graphic novel.\nEvaluate the project's performance and plan for the next chapters.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByWvFmvG6.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Scope and Budget**:\nSince this is a graphic novel of 64 pages I will need around 10 to 12 months to finish it.\nThe ideal deadline would be the next Nouniversary and I’ll push myself and the team involved to do so, but I’m organizing the dates including all the team efforts and the standard timeframes to make the deadline more realistic so it could be released in October/November next year.\n\n---\n\n## **Budget Breakdown:**\n\n- **Preproduction -

It outlines the first steps which includes creating the first Nouns House, mobile app, and website. As a second step, we plan to submit another proposal by February 2024 to fund the Nouns House DAO treasury followed by successful execution of this proposal. \n\n**We have already created the Nouns House DAO multi-sig [treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1C99D1e81772aFF2eD0ABC802AA571B19cE2d72B), and all of the funding from this and future proposal will be going to the treasury.**\n\nThanks in advance for your support and feedback! ⌐◧-◧\n\n## TL;DR\n\nHello! I am [tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth), co-founder of Enabler DAO ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/enabler.fun/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/enablerofficial), [Website](https://enablerdao.com/)). Our decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focuses on gathering, utilizing, managing, and improving idle assets like unused houses and cars within communities worldwide. My fellow co-founder at Enabler DAO, [yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth), is a holder of [Noun 312](https://nouns.wtf/noun/312), and we believe in the power of NounsDAO just as you do.\n\nWe are proposing a funding of **45,450 USDC** to give a Nounish makeover to a vacation rental property in Tokyo, Japan, valued over $1,000,000 USD. We intend to create “Nouns House #1” with this funding. Our property has already completed interior and exterior renovations; **all of the funding will be used for the Nounish makeover, and development of mobile apps & websites.**\n\nWe believe the Nouns model holds a huge potential in the realm of asset management. **The decentralized, community-led governance model combined with NFT auction may open new forms of asset sharing.** We plan to take this Nouns approach of asset management and expand the Nouns House brand into a scalable global business.\n\nIn alignment with NounsDAO’s **CC0 philosophy**, we will make all software and hardware implemented in this project open source. Furthermore, we plan to collaborate with the Nouns projects active in Japan such as [pNouns](https://pnouns.wtf/en/) ([Noun 553](https://nouns.wtf/noun/553), [Noun 556](https://nouns.wtf/noun/556)), to add Nounish elements to Nouns House #1.\n\n**The diverse industry experience of our team will significantly contribute to the success of this project.** [yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth) is a former executive CPO at Mercari, [yukill.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukill.eth) is a former CEO at ZOZO Technologies, [Jiro](https://twitter.com/jiroisagame) is a former YouTuber with 1.3 million subscribers, and I, [tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth), am a former engineer from Amazon Seattle.\n\nThis proposal was inspired by [Nouns Deli](https://twitter.com/NounsDeli)’s proposal ([Proposal 254](https://nouns.wtf/vote/254), approved on 03/09/2023). Our next step is to establish a Nounish subDAO, called “Nouns House DAO”. Similar to the [Nouns Builder Protocol](https://nouns.build/) ([Proposal 167](https://nouns.wtf/vote/167), approved on 11/12/2022), we aim to create a subDAO inheriting NounsDAO’s auction, treasury, and governance system. We plan to create Nouns House #2 and subsequent Nouns Houses based on community decisions governed by Nouns House DAO.\n\n## 1.  Nouns House DAO ⌐◧-◧\n\nNouns House #1 created through this proposal will serve as the first Nouns House governed by Nouns House DAO. Following the successful execution of this proposal, we will submit a 2nd proposal to establish the Nouns House DAO as a Nounish subDAO. **Our goal is to create Nouns House in major cities around the world where people can experience Nouns art and culture.** Nouns House DAO will be responsible for the operation and financial management of all Nouns Houses. 100% of the funds secured in our proposals will be transferred to the treasury of Nouns House DAO.\n\n![Bedroom](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1W23f_T6aANo9mXh9-lUu3bypKSzU12M4)\n\n## 2. Enabler DAO / Core Team ⌐◧-◧\n\n**Enabler DAO is a asset sharing community that aims to facilitate easy sharing of large assets like houses and cars by leveraging blockchain and AI technology.** As of October 2023, we operate 10 properties across 5 locations (Tokyo, Kyoto, Atami, Teshikaga, and Honolulu) in Japan and the United States. These properties are monetized through asset sharing within the community as well as through Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) such as Airbnb and Booking.com. Below are some of our properties and links to OTAs.\n\n🇯🇵 [**WHITE HOUSE Atami**](https://airbnb.com/h/white-house-atami\n) - Shizuoka, Japan\n\n🇯🇵 [**MACHIYA Kyoto**](https://www.kyoto-machiya-inn.com/accommodations/hanatoki/\n) - Kyoto, Japan\n\n🇯🇵 [**THE NEST Teshikaga**](https://airbnb.com/h/the-nest-teshikaga) - Hokkaido, Japan\n\n🇺🇸 [**BEACH HOUSE Honolulu**](https://airbnb.com/h/beach-house-honolulu-annex) - Hawaii, USA\n\n![Properties](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1C5UfxmK62s98QryMGZ_SoTIpED1fTUru)\n\nThe 4 founders of Enabler DAO are [yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth) (Noun 312), former executive CPO of Mercari; [yukill.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukill.eth), former CEO at ZOZO Technologies & fund manager for MZ Web3 Fund; [Jiro](https://twitter.com/jiroisagame), former YouTuber “Charisma Brothers” with 1.3 million subscribers & managing partner at iFund; and [tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth), a trilingual former Amazon HQ engineer with 5-years of experience. Enabler DAO was founded in October 2021, and we currently operate with about 10 DAO members. **We have been operating highly successful and profitable vacation rental properties in multiple locations, and bring expertise in both rental operations and property management.** Moreover, our diverse team brings a wide range of business and product development experience, combined with our strong track record, I believe we are in a unique position to be successful at running the first Nouns House.\n\n## **3. Nounish Makeover ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe plan to transform our property in Aoyama, an upscale district in Tokyo, into \"Nouns House #1,\" with a Nounish makeover filled with art and goodies. \n\n![Living Room](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bwo_xZOKns30glLVRyeoQ7ROKojrQkIE)\n\nAoyama is a hub of designer boutiques, art galleries, cafes, and shopping districts. It's not only a attracts for affluent individuals but also a popular tourist destination. Given the area's reputation and successful track record of our nearby properties, **we anticipate strong demand for high-end vacation rental property in Aoyama.**\n\n![Sauna](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1kabDge7tB6HDlZqn1fYccFdnsMt0-AdX)\n\nIn recent years, there has been a “sauna boom” in Japan. The number of sauna enthusiasts has been increasing due to heightened health consciousness and the proliferation of sauna facilities. In fact, the number of sauna users in Japan has increased by more than one million in the past year, and high-end sauna facilities in Tokyo are extremely popular. **We believe that Nouns House #1 will become widely popular within the sauna communities and beyond.**\n\n![Bath](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=190MOtkZF68sFwLUJzwbxoO4hNEtKDfch)\n\nThe artwork used for interior and exterior of Nouns House #1 will be directed by [amiyoko.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/amiyoko.eth) who have contributed many artwork to various Nouns projects such as NounsDAO Anniversary Art 2023 and Sushi Nouns.\n\n![Exterior](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1hyjBQIT7dUaIGTc_5s9R6wbDK3mpLt5q)\n\nThe 1st floor is the sauna area, the 2nd floor features a living-dining-kitchen area, and the 3rd floor will be an office space and a bedroom. We aim to infuse each floor with Nounish elements while maintaining a sense of luxury in the interior design.\n\n![Chill](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1CvxZml-3RPmPaHxNUzN7yUE2DKu-wLyU)\n\n## **4. Mobile App ⌐◧-◧**\n\n**We will create a mobile app for making reservations and managing operations for all Nouns Houses to be created.** For development, we will be using an open-source framework called [Skeet](https://skeet.dev/en/) to enhance efficiency and productivity. [Skeet](https://skeet.dev/en/) integrates with GCP (Google Cloud Platform) and Firebase, making it easier to develop serverless full-stack applications.\n\nThe app utilizes the Solana blockchain, which offers a rich selections of tools and packages for on-chain development. Solana also supports user-friendly multi-chain wallets like Phantom. Moreover, the low gas fees on Solana enable cost-effective transactions.\n\nWe are incorporating a **token-gating** feature into the app to offer special coupons and priority reservations to Nouns House NFT holders (and more). The app will also handle room **inventory management** and automatically notify cleaners once a reservation is confirmed. Nouns House NFT holders can **earn utility tokens by contributing to the community by completing gigs listed in the app.**\n\nThe app will accept **credit cards and cryptocurrencies** as form of payment. It will also be fully integrated with the **smart home features**, enhancing guest experiences through mobile-operable smart locks (Sesame Lock) and smart lights (Philips Hue). The app will be maintained and updated to accommodate not only Nouns House #1 but all future additions to the Nouns House portfolio.\n\n## **5. Roadmap ⌐◧-◧**\n\n**We will start the Nounish makeover and the development of mobile app and website, immediately following the approval of this proposal.** In January 2024, we plan to pre-open Nouns House #1 for invited guests, and release the beta version of the website. In the following month, Nouns House #1 will have its grand opening, and the beta version of the app will be released.\n\n![Roadmap](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1_Lpte2aGlYzdNOcWuoYejee5cW1RHgxQ)\n\n## **6. Budget ⌐◧-◧**\n\n**We are proposing 45,450 USDC funding for creating Nouns House #1 and kick starting the software infrastructure development for Nouns House DAO.** The Nounish makeover will cost $17,000 (~10 ETH), the development of the mobile app and website will cost $30,450 (~17 ETH). All work will commence immediately upon the approval of the proposal.\n\n**Nouns House #1 Nounish Makeover: $17,000 (~10 ETH)**\n- \"Nounish\" Exterior Wall Art: $6,000\n- \"Nounish\" Interior Art: $8,000\n- \"Nounish\" Goodies: $3,000\n\n**Mobile App & Website (6-month development): $30,450 (~17 ETH)**\n- Founding Engineer: $5,000/month\n- [Skeet](https://skeet.dev/en/) (SDK): $75/month\n\n## **7. Community Benefits ⌐◧-◧**\n\n**This proposal aims to expand the Nouns community by creating the first \"Nouns House\", a network of properties where people can experience Nouns art and culture in major cities worldwide.**\n\nIn the next step, we will propose to establish Nouns House DAO, Nounish subDAO, that will own Real World Asset (RWA) and operate them as a profit-making business, and to scale the Nouns House brand as a global brand. RWA is an area where the web3 industry is still struggling, and this new venture has the potential to significantly advance the industry on this front.\n\nBoth Nouns and Nouns House NFT holders will be offered special perks such as discounted rates and priority access to Nouns Houses via token gating. Additionally, upon the funding of the Nouns House DAO treasury in our next proposal, **existing Nouns NFT holders can apply for Nouns House NFT airdrop by a pre-determined date**. This airdrop is optional and provides an opportunity for existing NounsDAO members to participate in the governance for Nouns House DAO without having to bid in the auction. \n\n## **8. CC0 ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe believe, Nouns House’s CC0 culture will bring innovation to the real estate industry. While real estate design and architecture are generally not open-source, we will make all of these publicly available through our CC0 library. CC0 approach will also have a large impact on the vacation rental industry. By providing tools to help achieve efficient operations, we will accelerate the automation and digital transformation of the traditionally labor intensive and manual vacation rental industry. **The interest and attention that this CC0 model will generate within these industries will serve as the ideal platform for spreading the culture and values of Nouns.**\n\n## **9. Risks & Considerations ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe are enthusiastic members of the Nouns community and, as Noun owner, strongly resonate with the vision of Nouns. **We believe that the Nouns model holds innovative power in asset management and vacation rental fields.** This decentralized, community-led governance model has the potential to offer new approaches in asset sharing and feels like the ideal way to manage assets in a decentralized manner. On the other hand, there are some risks considered in achieving the vision of this project:\n\n1. **Regulatory Risk**: Operating within a decentralized framework could potentially make the project subject to regulations. Compliance with local laws is crucial.\n2. **Technical Risk**: The integration of blockchain technology with physical assets like real estate presents several challenges. The implementation of smart contracts to manage the property must be executed flawlessly.\n3. **Community Engagement**: The strength of a DAO lies in its community. For long-term success, it's important to maintain community engagement and participation in governance.\n\nBy acknowledging these risks and proactively addressing them, we aim for the success of the Nouns House project.","slug":"nouns-house-1---tokyo-jpn","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0x1609406ce84b7a28e942d7850e17c0e35d06b8eb464f01eda7d8f9db9b1a0d49","reason":"Added more details and visuals"},{"blockNumber":18453108,"blockHash":"0x6f5d1aa1979a83170ec3ef938781c0592cd00644b601615388047c4d8ac5dd55","transactionIndex":73,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0x5958651c0e730b192cacd616fca87ae1769a1eed7a4d4003758db7e5932cd8aa","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0x7f64C6e6908DE72221A06A06b4a02A6546a4d6d2","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)",""],"calldatas":["0x00000000000000000000000058947f539f1c1e930c2aea6e8a9fb0ecc976335700000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000105ef39b200","0x"],"description":"# Nouns : A Movie - Chapter 3, 4 & 5! ⌐◨-◨\n\n [![](https://i.postimg.cc/1zK1hgNV/blunts-announcement.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef6hLq_xXUo)\n\n*[Nouns Movie](https://nouns.movie/) Episode 2 with runtime of 11 mins is scheduled to be released in the week of Nov 15, 2023. Episode 2 will also be the first multi-client droposal in collaboration with Nounsagora. Droposal will come soon.*\n\n### Tl;dr:\nThis specific prop is seeking funding to create **Episode 3, 4 & 5 with a run-time of 10.5-11 mins each** delivered within 240 days.\n\n#### What is Atrium?\nAtrium is a crypto-native network of independent artists and creators. Disciplines represented on Atrium currently include Screenwriting, Animation, Concept Art, VFX, Voice Actors, and Music production. Together, creatives on Atrium bring the best ranging experiences from **Pixar, Marvel, Luma Pictures, Sony, Netflix & many more.**\n\n---\n### Proposal Ask:\n 1,125,000 (375K X 3) USD for a time-period of 240 days.\n\n> Note: *Ask is following the funding breakdown shared in the original kick-off [proposal 245](https://nouns.wtf/vote/245).*  \n\n#### Proposal timeline progress\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/wBLDJgz6/3244.png)\n\n#### Why Ask for 3 episodes at once?\n- Working on 3 month-long milestones at a time was tuned in to showcase proof-of-work to DAO and drive accountability forward.\n\n\n- Since then [Nouns Movie](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie) team has led by example, on what it means to be transparent in production process and keeping community at large in the loo.\n\n\n- What we realised however, this introduced inefficiency in securing long-term senior talent to be available to work on the film as they have no guarantee on whether they will still be working on the film after 3 months (*for e.g. followup proposals not passing*). We are often competing against traditional studio contracts for senior talent.\n  \n- Funding 3 episodes upfront will enable us to introduce batching of tasks for pre-production and animation, making the process much more predictable to manage. \n\n\n- More funding committed for the film will enable us to pre-empt discussions with distribution partners who will have a clearer picture of financing on the project and high likelihood of it being fully completed once they commit.\n\n---\n#### Where will the funds go to?\n- **Story and Scripting** for the Episode 3, 4 & 5 \n- **Preview Work in Progress and BTS** delivered through out the proposal duration\n- **Finished Episode 3,4 & 5** - delivered by 240 days time period.\n- Propdates published all along the way.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r19IfQTw3.png)\n\n\nAs we continue production, the timeline becomes more efficient and shrinks, ultimately leading us to the film conclusion. \n\n#### Kickoff Notes for EP3 onwards\n- After Episode 2 release, the team will be on a short hiatus for the rest of November (2 weeks).\n- Team ramps back up slowly throughout month of December and sporadic availability due to holiday month.\n- Expected to fully iron out EP3 script during this time period.\n- Team back at full capacity starting January and full production loop resumes. \n---\n\n### Recap and Progress Updates so far\nYou can follow Ep2 Propdates [here](https://www.updates.wtf/prop/317). \n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/2/2415348f7943c8a429024b648b3eb68b24a0d7fa_2_1380x862.jpeg)\n\n**Tl;dr:** Its bolder, bigger and better! \n\n\n#### Cast Announcements so far\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1zVh9NsW/19.png)\n\n- [Elijah Fox](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1701347725407838288) (Voice of Gi)\n- [Lisa Stanley](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1656100844763496448) (Voice of Mrs Waxman)\n- [Ray Hurd](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1710009700341928121) (Voice of Go)\n- [Cesar Romero](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1711863323967578591) (Voice of Leader blunt)\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/253cSV1K/environment-factory-hallyway.png)\n#### Behind the Scenes\n- [Discourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E_7XtzU47c&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation) with the directors : How Nouns Movie enabled them to do something unthinkable, completely remotely.\n- Understanding the intricacies of Blus [Musical Score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4OavIimoXs&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation).\n- Fun Trivia about the world [sound design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7umbTCiMTmk&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation) with Jordan - our SFX Lead.\n\n#### First Casting call\n- Casting call complete. 15 characters from other Nouns-values aligned communities were selected to make cameo appearances through out the Episode 2.\nhttps://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1686797509765840896\n- We intend to do more of these along to way opening the world of Blus outwards for others to participate in.\n\n#### Team Expansion Announcements\n- Dan Waters\nhttps://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1693785090340643078\n\n\n### DApp / UI Updates\n- **Nouns.Movie** was created to publish the story (dedicated webapp built with minting UX on top of Zora & cumulative leaderboard built-in)\n- Added Multi-episode support. \n- Introduced Worldview mints: Inexpensive art mints from different locations from the world of Blus that adds to cumulative ranking on the leaderboard.\n- Dedicated Behind the scenes section for audience to watch and explore auxillary content.\n- Planned token-gating for streaming content.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1Xd6YyB7/11111.png)\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/fTsHzvSg/2222.png)\n\n---\n\n### Story Updates\n**Genre**: Action, Comedy\n\nScript for the delivered Episode 2 can be found [***here***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gdInCNXaLvKA5Vrxe6aCTiOtE67jNpG6/view?usp=sharing)\n\n*We also created a rough outline of how the story progresses through completion.

Designed to be worn day and night, it reaches places that the Noggles glasses can't. This watch represents a powerful demonstration of what the Nouns community can achieve, extending the brand's narrative into an entirely new realm of self-expression. It seamlessly combines nounishness and horology, on the verge of becoming **the most personal and novel product Nouns has ever created**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PleFEx9.png)\n## The NounsWatch cc0 design: accessible to everyone\n\nCreated by renowned watch designer Rafael Miranda, the bold Noggle-inspired design is **half a watch and half a ⌐◨-◨**, literally. And like all nounish things should be, it’s cc0!\n\n\n\nIt's as much about functionality as it is about meticulous attention to detail. It features an exquisite *mysterious hours* full day half display, with a glass mirror and a black dial. The hour and minute handles are individual pieces that combines every hour to form the Noggles symbol. On the NounsWatch, **every hour is Noun O'Clock!**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NC00WLn.gif)\n\n## The most personal Nouns product yet\n\nExplore a diverse range of personalization options with the interchangeable straps.

Watch the prototype live in video: [here](https://x.com/rsmiranda/status/1714557390241059120?s=20) and [here.](https://x.com/fabioseva/status/1714901327631843711?s=46&t=OnA_W289RIsplarDuhpSrg)\nNote: The current brand identity will be revised for production version.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PekUrdI.png)\n\n## Final Product Specs\n\n**Case:** Injected Polycarbonate, 42 mm x 42 mm x 6 mm.\n**Movement:** Japanese.\n**Dial**: Exquisite half display reading system, black dial with contrasting numbers.\n**Glass:** Mineral glass with anti-reflective coating. \n**Strap:** Soft Silicone.\n**Water resistance:** Yes (3ATM)\n\n---\n\n# Dwiss: a decade of innovation\n\nDWISS - the manufacturer - is a niche watch brand founded in 2011 by Rafael Miranda, a former professor of watch design in Milan, Italy. His accolades include several design awards and publications in the watch industry.\n\nThe brand is committed to craft distinctive timepieces that stands out with innovative designs and groundbreaking features, including the use of pioneering materials and early adoption of web3 technology such as cryptocurrency, NFTs and metaverse experiences in the watch space.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p8gK5Fi.png)\n\n![](https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1694722112/t9ce7v5l3t52g3azgydp.png)\n\n![](https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1694722042/xhyf0mdtyqkfiip0plmr.jpg)\n\n\n## Contemporary distribution methods\n\nDWISS also excels in modern distribution methods. Leveraging the power of crowdfunding and Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) strategies, launching multiple campaigns and mastering influencer and digital advertising. These accomplishments attest to DWISS's strong marketing and sales capabilities, setting a **solid foundation for the success of our Go-to-Market strategy for NounsWatch**.\n\nCrowdfunding campaigns that generated more than USD $1.5 million.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/U5gHT6Y.png)\n\nDwiss have a portfolio of influencers that have millions of followers especially in Youtube, but also instagram, facebook, blogs and magazines.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JS08Qcu.png)\n\nDwiss masters Digital Advertising, generating 9.4 millions of impressions, and 109k clicks in 2023 alone.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f3G84AV.png)\n\n---\n\n# A unparalleled opportunity to reach a new audience\n\nWe meticulously planned a winning Go-to-Market Strategy to make the most of it with optimal resources. **The NounsWatch collection seizes an unparalleled opportunity of introducing Nouns to a whole new audience.** \n\n## Step 0: Entering the Affordable Fashion Market\n\nIn an industry that generated over $70 billion in 2022, fashion ranks as the second most significant reason people wear watches, trailing only behind timekeeping. This largely accounts for why the fashion watch segment records the highest annual unit sales in the tens of millions. **The NounsWatch collection pricing and style aims to secure a position in the largest portion of this growing segment: the sub-$200 fashion watch market.**\n\nThat said, time to sell.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DprKVhF.png)\n\n## Step 1: A pre-sale shortcut to meet 10 Million customers on Indiegogo\n\nA common challenge to IRL products is meeting the minimum order quantities (MOQ) whilst ensuring enough demand for the product. And for custom designed watches, the MOQ of 1000 pieces makes the equation a bit challenging. \n\nThanks to Dwiss successful track record on Indiegogo campaigns we can have a reputable access to create a Drop.\n\nAn Indiegogo Drop is an exclusive offer for qualified business that serves a discount pre-sale channel without the need for the regular crowdfunding. The highlight is the added layer of marketing to reach the fullest of Indiegogo’s 10 million monthly visitors and 1 million combined social media followers from 235 countries.\n\nDwiss will launch a NounsWatch Drop pre-sale for the price of ~~$189.00~~ $129.00 with [teaser videos and images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7ZsbPHqzFw) that will feature Nouns on the homepage of the Indiegogo website, as well as in related content such as carousels, newsletters, and social media.\n\n**By doing so, we aim to generate sufficient demand for NounsWatch, particularly from outside the Nouns and watchmaking communities, thus bringing it closer to mainstream media and markets.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/exRMxAh.png)\n\n## Step 2: Continuous sale on the NounsWatch Shopify store\n\nAfter the presale window concludes, sales will resume in our website [nounswatch.com](http://nounswatch.com/) for $189.00 ($169.00 for selected communities), where we will accept both fiat currency and cryptocurrency. Leveraging the same proven digital marketing strategy that Dwiss employs for its products, we are going to use a share of the sales profit in Digital Advertising to generate millions of impressions and drive hundreds of thousands of clicks to our website, until the point of delivery and after. If demand falls short, Dwiss name is in play. We bear the risk and will undertake the responsibility of selling the product.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jIsZVSV.jpg)\n\n## Step 3: Ding-dong! Delivery Time\n\nUpon receiving the initial shipment from the factory, we'll start fulfilling orders through both Indiegogo and Shopify channels. At the same time, we'll ramp up our marketing efforts to stimulate new demand, focusing on a broad [influencer campaign and a user-generated content initiative](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5h5gh3ZqPzjm_Rrt6FKdrTbbJ00IF9Es). **This is a pivotal moment for the NounsWatch and Nouns history, and we are committed to maximizing its impact.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wztkALV.png)\n\n## Step 4: The NounsWatch Legacy\n\n**Spin the Flywheel (new!)**\nRegardless the supply, **10% of every NounsWatch collection sales revenue will be sent back to the Treasury** and submitted to Propdates. Assuming a pre-sale sold-out of 1000 pieces, the gross revenue would be $129,000. 10% of this ($12,900) goes back to the DAO treasury, further reducing the actual costs to the DAO. Sales out of the pre-sale window generate more revenue.\n\n**Release the IP (new!)**\nThe NounsWatch blueprint and 3d files **will be cc0, fully available on the public domain**.\n\n**Everyday, forever (new!)**\nThe objective for NounsWatch is not to exist as a limited edition, but rather to establish it as a standard product in the Dwiss partnership lineup. **We will sustain production for as long as consumer demand remains**, and may release new straps, models, and features when deemed appropriate.\n\n**Warranty and Customer Support**\nDwiss will provide a world-class ongoing support and warranty for customers after 2 years they have purchased NounsWatch.\n\n---\n\n## **Funds Allocation**\n\nWe have meticulously planned the budget to ensure optimal allocation of funds across all critical aspects of the project. Our financial strategy for V2 has been redesigned to sustain our competitive pricing strategy while accommodating the increased workload of the team until the sales take-off. \n\nWe have estimated the financial requirements for the NounsWatch project as follows:\n\n- $5,000 - Development\n- $90,000 - NounsWatch and straps (1,000 pieces)\n- $10,000 - Packaging\n- $25,000 - External Labor and Taxes\n- $14,000 - First-Class Video and 3D Production (third-party services)\n- $7,000 - Indiegogo Drop Paid Feature Package\n- $18,000 - Team Compensation\n\n**TOTAL ASK: $169,000 USDC**\nWallet: [dwiss.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x80b0b325D6A1E19953dFffb6Cc117263916796F8)\n\n## Timeline\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UK7lhJP.png)\n\n---\n\n## Team\n\n[Fabio Seva](https://x.com/fabioseva) - Concept & Marketing\nLilNoun#125, nouns-pilled founder of [Public Good Beer](https://twitter.com/publicgoodbeer?s=21&t=OnA_W289RIsplarDuhpSrg)\n[Rafael Miranda](https://x.com/rsmiranda) - Design\nLilNoun#7753, watch designer and Dwiss founder\n[Dwiss](https://x.com/dwisswatch) - Production and operations\n\n---\n\n**Acknowledgments:** we would like to thank the dozens of comments we received during V1, which enabled us to develop this new version. By participating in this project, the DAO is not just 'spending' on a product but making a strategic investment in invaluable brand equity. This intangible value—captured through consumer engagement, social influence, and expanded market reach—is an asset that can far outlive the investment, providing a return that is difficult to quantify. It’s important to understand that the full impact of this investment will unfold over time, requiring a level of trust in the project’s long-term vision and execution.","slug":"nounswatch-nouns-iconic-cc0-timepieces---v2","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0xb906e1ab853177664d67a8363882ae5329743c3a019a613eb29c30dde52e1c50","reason":"fix tldr topic"},{"blockNumber":18464656,"blockHash":"0x8a407bea8e2e03a5799bb3c8887104ab9cd9756291da3c971c7ac6e08ebc59d0","transactionIndex":120,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0x25e3f808ae731950c67d6a15787d73f0b3fba8ac63a38cfb5e96ed1a30f8a08e","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0xae4705dC0816ee6d8a13F1C72780Ec5021915Fed","targets":["0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03"],"signatures":["safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef71000000000000000000000000ae4705dc0816ee6d8a13f1c72780ec5021915fed000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004e"],"description":"# pipe.⌐◨-◨\n\n![baptism](https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExdGY0ZzRjNWF4NDh3NmlxeXUwN3NmbzUzb2g1cXlydzkwN3Y3NnN2aCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/t34aQaV4ihcD2uyHFE/giphy.gif)\nSince days of yore, I, Pipe, did declare mine intent to partake as a product designer and governance enjoyer of the Nouns DAO until the final bell tolls.\n\nI am undertaking [a design research project](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/139) and creating a designer's handbook to release in the next 12-24 months.

These are fantastic resources for developers and designers, but can be difficult for non-technical audiences to use. We want to bring accessibility and utility of Nouns to **everyone** by providing a simple, seamless way to use Nouns avatars and art across the best digital platforms and spaces. \n\n![nounsIntegrations](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/pineappleMosaic.gif)\n\n## Proposal brief\nWith the Bounce platform, we want to bridge the Nouniverse and the open Metaverse:\n\n- make current and future Nouns easily to use, seamlessly, across digital platforms ⇒ **everyone** can experience and enjoy Nouns, forever\n- bring exposure in more spaces to new audiences, both web3 and web2 ⇒ **grow** Nouns community\n- build and open and extensible system with a Bounce API & SDK ⇒ **empower** community to innovate and build on top of Bounce\n\n## Feedback Q&A\n\n**onizuka.eth - Abstained**\n\n**Q**: I think there is a value in proliferating across Snap/Instagram, but I think there has already been progress made on filters there (from CoralOrca?) I'm not sure what exactly the public API would be for? general infrastructure like this can be valuable, but I'm not optimistic about something like the bounce site getting any sort of use from such a decentralized org like Nouns\n\n**A**: Great feedback and thanks for bringing up these points. CoralOrca and 0xFloyd have done fantastic work on [social filters](https://www.snapchat.com/explore/nouns/lenses), as well as [Noun 3D models](https://3dnouns.xyz/). This proposal builds on top of both of these by providing a hub where all experiences are easily accessible, not only social filters but also VR Chat, Mona, and any other platforms that will be integrated into Bounce in the future.\n\nOur goal is to make these cross-platform experiences easily accessible through all DAO projects, both web (with a public API to link directly to Nouns experiences) and physical (Bounce NFC tags, QR codes). The Bounce site will act as a hub for Nouns and other onboarded projects, and will help bring in other users and communities into the Nouniverse.\n\n## Budget\n\nWe’re asking for 15 ETH (to the Bounce multisig safe) to onboard Nouns onto Bounce and enable cross-world experiences.\nThe budget includes:\n\n- Build a Nouns X Bounce community microsite\n- Cost of asset onboarding and processing all existing and future Nouns for the following platforms:\n    - VRChat\n    - Mona\n    - Snap\n    - Instagram\n- Making Bounce connections free for everyone, across all spaces, forever\n- Developing new platform integrations for spaces the Nouns community is excited about\n\n# Proposal\n\nBounce is a new cross-world digital asset platform that makes it easy for fans and collectors to embody their avatars in immersive web2 and web3 platforms, and connect with their communities. Our goal is to empower avatar communities to embody their avatars, express themselves and come together in more immersive and engaging ways.\n\nThis proposal is to onboard Nouns onto Bounce as an early partner, making Nouns enjoyable by the community across a range of digital spaces, including social, gaming and metaverse platforms\n\n## How Bounce benefits the Nouns community\n\n- Easily enjoy Nouns as avatars, sticker packs, face filters and more across social, gaming and metaverse platforms\n- Expand the community and reach of the Nouns brand and content across digital spaces\n- Access more platforms and experiences as they roll out, new spaces are available to all Nouns, new and existing\n- Support other DAO projects with public API and SDK that make “bouncing” a seamless and hassle-free process\n- Bounce Tags support phygital projects with easy onboarding and allocated stock\n- Nouns on Bounce will be free for everyone, forever\n\n## Deliverables\n\nThe project is estimated at 1.5 to 2 months and will include:\n\n- **A unique Bounce X Nouns microsite** where the community can go to bounce across spaces and enjoy exclusive content. This site also acts as a landing page for special Nouns events and activations across spaces. (EXAMPLE MOCKUP BELOW)\n    \n    ![nounsMicrositeMockup.jpg](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/nounsPage.jpg)\n    \n- **Cross platform digital avatars** that can be used as in-space characters, face lenses and filters, sticker packs and more across a range of platforms.\n    \n    Platforms include:\n    \n  - VR Chat\n    \n    ![VRChat Nouns](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/vrchatGifNouns.gif)\n\n    \n  - Mona\n    \n    ![Mona Nouns](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/monaGif.gif)\n  \n    \n  - AR Filters: (ROUGH PROTOTYPE BELOW)\n    - Snap\n    - Instagram\n    \n    ![AR Filter Nouns](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/social+lenses.gif)\n\n    \n- More spaces the community is excited about\n- **Public API, SDK and docs** that can be used by other DAO projects to give utility to digital assets and make bouncing a hassle free integration.\n- **Free access to everyone, across all spaces, forever**\n\nWe also commit to posting frequent updates on https://www.updates.wtf/ to keep the community informed on progress and updates, both as the proposal is developed, and as future platforms and experiences are rolled out and made available.\n\n# Future proposals\n\n## Bounce X Nouniverse events and community activations\n\nWe think the best way to experience bounce as a community is through special events, gatherings and activations. Our collab with the Wassies community was made so much more exciting by their VR Chat Among Us and Zombie Survival (https://twitter.com/ByWassiesEvents)\n\nAs Nouns is decentralized, we’d like to put forward future proposals to design, plan, coordinate and market events and games across platforms.\n\n## Bounce Tags for DAO and community projects\n\nBounce Tags, our secure chain-linked NFC tags, are integrated into the Bounce ecosystem and make bouncing from a physical collectible to digital spaces a quick and seamless experience. Many DAO proposals are dedicated to crafting both amazing new Nouns physical products (Noggle Changers, NounsDAO x Pudgy Penguins toys, NOUNISH FRIENDS mini-figures, etc), and these could all be linked using tags (think tapping your Nouns glasses and bouncing to Nouns AR filters and more). We would like to put forward a future proposal to provide tags for community projects (as part of their proposals) that will be custom designed, programmed and integrated with our support. \n\n# Who we are\n\n## About Bounce\n\nBounce is a new cross-world avatar platform that makes it easy for fans and collectors to embody their avatars in immersive web2 and web3 platforms, and connect with their communities. We automate all platform-specific integrations, such as coding, rigging, file conversions and API & SDK connections, making it simple to use a unique physical or digital collectible (such as NFTs, sneakers, trading cards and more), generated based on unique traits, as an avatar across platforms. Our Bounce Tag uses active encryption NFC to ensure a secure and permanent link between authentic physical goods and their digital counterparts.\n\n- Learn more about Bounce - [letsbounce.gg](http://www.letsbounce.gg/)\n\n## Bounce partnerships with avatar communities\n\nA great example of how Bounce can help engage and activate a web3 community is our recent partnership with Wassies. Bounce allows the Wassies community to enjoy their fridge-dwelling creatures in new ways, from face filters on Snap and Instagram, to custom avatars on VR Chat, and create unique HD renders of their Wassie. \n\nWassies on Bounce can be viewed by everyone, holders can bounce their held ones, and CC0 Wassies are available for everyone to bounce.\n\nResponse from the Wassies community has been great, and the team has created a series of engaging events on Twitter and VR Chat that brought together fans and holders to play games, show off their unique renders and wassify their socials. \n\nBelow is footage from a Wassies concert in VRChat this weekend, powered by the Bounce VRChat integration.  \n![Wassie Event](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/wassiesEvent.gif)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Microsite for Bounce collab with Wassies](https://beta.letsbounce.gg/wassies)\n- [Wassies announcement tweet](https://twitter.com/bywassies/status/1709554217331949818) (41.4k impressions)\n- [Wassies VRChat event](https://twitter.com/bywassies/status/1710625261178228794)\n\n## The Team\n\nBounce is developed by Barak & Jasper, experienced creative technologists and builders in web3.

Looking forward to your thoughts!\n\n---\n\n*“Is Nouns activity growing?” “Who is helping increase engagement and spreading the meme?” “Which proposals are driving growth?” “What’s our spend rate?” “How many builders are contributing to the Nouns ecosystem?” “Are the amount of proposal candidates increasing?”*\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\nWe aim to create a single-purpose website where Nouns activity metrics are published. It will integrate activity across social channels and highlight which Nouns, advocates, and proposals have best supported the Noun’s meme propagation. Our creative motto is: *Track Memes, Not People.*\n\nAs a starting point, this proposal focuses on [1] onchain activity (supported by the Nouns subgraph), [2] two sources of social media (Farcaster and Instagram), and [3] a limited set of metrics — such as proposal submissions, votes, comments, posts, and engagement. Opportunistically, we will incorporate additional sources and expand the set of metrics.\n\n## Background\n\nAs of the moment, the Nouns’ community and audience members produce a wide variety of data. Over time, more data is likely to migrate onchain (e.g. similar to vote comments today) and data will be produced across even more digital localities. The *United World of Nouns* will have a wide-ranging data footprint. Combining data across these localities can become a powerful tool for proposal development and decision-making.\n\nHowever, as @Krel mentioned in their [Request for Proposers](https://www.notion.so/Nouns-DAO-Request-for-Proposers-94dadff999ac493b9902aa002e4b296e?pvs=21):\n\n> *“Nouns DAO does not have a reliable way to measure ‘growth’ or ‘success’. Its not clear what should be measured, or what growth in the context of Nouns even means.”*\n> \n\nThis project will create an initial repository of activity growth combining onchain and offchain data. We are long overdue to experiment on this front!\n\n## Scope\n\nThe metrics tracker will be in the form of a single-purpose web application.\n\nTo begin, we will include onchain data available in the Nouns Subgraph and two social media channels: Farcaster and Instagram. We will publish a selection of core metrics that provide clarity to Noun holders and the wider community.\n\nMost importantly, the underlying data pool (Meme Activity Database) will serve a first step towards a data-driven Nouns culture, which community members and potential builders can use to find opportunities for proposal submissions.\n\nSuccess of this project will be measured based on web application usage (unique visitors), proposal references (e.g. This project will increase X metric supporting Noun activity growth), and data pool connections (e.g. external usage of the Meme Activity Database).\n\nAs a stretch goal, we will look to expand the data sources, for example including key derivative NFT projects (Gnars, LilNouns, cc0-lib) and other dominant social spaces (Discord, Discourse, X, Lens, etc).\n\n*Note: X (formerly Twitter) has been deprioritized due to its cost ($5k per month) until initiative is proven useful. It would be included in future proposals.*\n\n*Note: Discord has been deprioritized due to its fragmentation (there multiple Nouns servers) until initiative is proven useful. It would be included in future proposals.*\n\n## Product Components\n\n### \n\nWhenever we want to test our internet speed, we can easily go to a speed test website. If we want to see how our activity on X (formerly Twitter), we can go to profile analytics. \n\n**Where do we go to check how the Nouns ecosystem is growing?** We go to *.*\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByD5JEHfp.png)\n\nThe Pulse is a single purpose website showcasing onchain and offchain activity metrics. This includes public conversations related to the **********************United World of Nouns.********************** The main graph, which we are currently calling *“Activity Momentum”* will showcase daily activity growth, a proxy for the Noun meme adoption and mind-share online.\n\nOur data analytics approach will combine methodologies from (1) traditional media broadcasting (e.g. combining data like number of views, replies, likes, proposal submissions, unique voters, etc.), (2) crypto-native metrics common across DAOs, and (3) materials science and engineering (read more about how engineers develop [material selection indexes here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_selection)).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJSJgVrGp.png)\n\nData will be synchronized in real-time directly from the Nouns’ Subgraph, Farcaster, Instagram to an SQL database. The sync mechanism will be architected in a uniform adapter interface for easier future integration with other onchain data and offchain sources, such as Twitter, Discourse, Discord, Telegram, DeSo, and Lens.\n\n**Example Onchain Metrics:**\n\n- Treasury\n- Treasury Usage Rate (Monthly Spend)\n- Burn Value\n- Candidate Props Growth\n- Proposal Submissions Growth\n- Active Proposals\n- Percent of Proposals Funded\n- Total Unique Builders\n- Average Auction Price\n\n**Example Offchain Metrics:**\n\n- Number of Posts\n- Total Engagement (Likes+Comments+Shares)\n- Engagement Rate (Ratio of Engagement to Posts)\n- Most Engaged Content\n- Total Followers\n- Follower Growth Rate (Updated based on API opportunity)\n- Noggles Score: Count of posts using “⌐◨-◨” on Farcaster*\n\n**In the first phase it won’t be possible to index Instagram posts by content, only be hashtags. As a result, the Noggles Score won’t be able to include Instagram posts.*\n\n### Meme Activity Database (a.k.a. The MAD)\n\nCurcially, the product’s underlying data model will be available for others to query and contribute to. That way, others can embed the index into their own Noun interfaces. Anyone should be able to get clean and reliable **meme-data-as-a-service** to support a diversity of Noun initiatives. Imagine a world where active proposals have conversation hype trackers, or ongoing projects can easily see total impressions across social media channels.\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to facilitate the use of data across the Nouns ecosystem. As the cc0 library enables media usage, the activity database enables tracking and impact analysis.\n\nThe Web API interface will be available publicly in the form of parametrizable JSON endpoints. The data will be distributed per specific sources (onchain Nouns, Farcaster, and others) as well as in aggregated form to enable the development of tools such as alerts, bots, and analytics dashboards.\n\n## Product Roadmap\n\nThe execution of this project will be done in an iterative fashion. By building in public and getting ongoing feedback, we can deliver what the community needs, and data that will support Nouns decisions.\n\n**Iterative Phases:**\n\n- **Phase 1:** Deliver basic UI w/ limited branding and processed Farcaster data displayed in form of metrics. Deliver mock-up UI for onchain metrics and Instagram metrics. Host open Q&A with Nouns (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 2:** Deliver basic UI w/ Farcaster metric feedback, plus Noun Subgraph indexing and onchain metrics. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 3:** Deliver basic UI w/ Farcaster, Onchain metric feedback, and Instagram metrics for specific accounts and hashtags. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 4:** Complete UI polishing and metrics calibration. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to celebrate launch and discuss future opportunities (where next).\n\n## An Ambitious Vision\n\nThis project aims to uncover what “Nouns-Native” analytics could look like, and what data infrastructure is necessary to feed this analytics into the broader Nouns governance and participation process.\n\nWe’ve already intuited that we want to ***Track*** ***Memes, Not People*** — and we’re certain there will be other innovations along the way. After all, we need to address challenges in crossing the web3-to-web2 data pipeline chasm. Is it possible? We think so.\n\nNouns is a place for ambitious ideas, and we are an ambitious team.\n\n## Team\n\nThis project will be led and executed by Rafa Fernandez (Farcaster: @rafa) and Rafi Gutkowski (Farcaster: @rafi). \n\n- Rafa Fernandez is a community architect with a focus on building [Digital Public Utilities](https://www.notion.so/General-Networks-e4615b9b52294f8bab34a82b47023d11?pvs=21). He has decade of experience in corporate analytics and studied materials-science and engineering. He is the founder of Folklore (Folklore.Institute), a community that curates and commissions research on digital cultures. Most recently, he was part of the Summer of Protocols research program looking at [online swarms](https://www.notion.so/Welcome-to-the-Swarm-41c114211ac045f087c44c16bd993748?pvs=21). Previous to the program he worked at Mirror where he worked in creator partnerships and community development.\n- Rafi Gutkowski is a software engineer and data scientist ([libred.org](https://libred.org/), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/rgutkowski)). He started mining bitcoin in 2015 but only after exiting from his recent startup, did he double down on web3. Since then Rafi has been working on sementic analysis of decentralized social graphs, as well as creating web3-web2 bridges, such as Folklore’s web3-signature to feed [broadcast applet](https://www.notion.so/Folklore-5d34757913064064b87119c4593eda74?pvs=21).\n\n## Funding\n\nWe are a stream of 22.5 ETH to fund this project over approximately 10 weeks.\n\nThe funds will be allocated to a two-person team (Rafa and Rafi). They are split roughly 25-75 between planning and iterative engineering. There is about a 40-40-10 between data engineering, visuals and handoff. There is approximately 10% reserved for bugs and issue resolution.\n\nWe expect that once the initial traunch of data engineering and visuals is complete, then we can make a decision on what the community needs more of (if anything), such as expanded data, or expanded analysis\n\n## Our Commitments\n\n- We commit to posting updates on [updates.wtf](https://updates.wtf/) with sprint plan and outcomes, in alignment with each of the community Q&A feedback sessions.\n- We commit to cancelling the stream based on community feedback.\n- We commit to executing this work as an open-source project, such that other onchain communities and organizations can benefit.\n\n## Other Notes\n\nThis proposal was built based on the Basic Nouns Proposal Template, built by Rafa and available here: https://hackmd.io/@rafathebuilder/BkPAmHZbp\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about this proposal, the first Q&A conversation on Aburra is available here: https://youtu.be/_dr2yZulMG","slug":"the-noun-pulse","proposalIdToUpdate":0,"encodedProposalHash":"0x958bc3fd083b5707f301f14e08a8dd4752d32c766222e9ddda736de542e20c8d","reason":"Updated Title for clarity and streaming terms to align with calendar"},{"blockNumber":18479444,"blockHash":"0x5dfeea055428693dced60aef15f07e6c1b7ef8ffcb3db3d34523814fba188d87","transactionIndex":135,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0xd71a3326269567db0ad9b3ef25fd9b8b6101dda03e75b2cf672a893856991b22","eventName":"ProposalCandidateUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalCandidateUpdated(address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],string,string,uint256,bytes32,string)","msgSender":"0xae4705dC0816ee6d8a13F1C72780Ec5021915Fed","targets":["0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03"],"signatures":["safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef71000000000000000000000000ae4705dc0816ee6d8a13f1c72780ec5021915fed000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004e"],"description":"# pipe.⌐◨-◨\n\n![baptism](https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExdGY0ZzRjNWF4NDh3NmlxeXUwN3NmbzUzb2g1cXlydzkwN3Y3NnN2aCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/t34aQaV4ihcD2uyHFE/giphy.gif)\nI am undertaking [a design research project](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/139) and creating a designer's handbook to release in the next 12-24 months.

It outlines the first steps which includes creating the first Nouns House and mobile app. As a second step, we plan to submit follow-up proposal by Feburary 2024 to transfer initial funding to the DAO treasury followed by successful execution of this proposal.\n\n**We have already established the Nouns House DAO multi-sig [treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC7181dc3863932F9b375bC348fe4A421B8003A), and all of the funding from this and future proposal will be going to the treasury.**\n\n***\n\n## TL;DR\n\nHello! I am **[tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth)**, co-founder of Enabler DAO (**[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/enabler.fun/)**, **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/enablerofficial)**, **[Website](https://enablerdao.com/)**). Our decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focuses on gathering, utilizing, managing, and improving idle assets like unused houses and cars within communities worldwide. My fellow co-founder at Enabler DAO, **[yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth)**, is a holder of **[Noun 312](https://nouns.wtf/noun/312)**, and we believe in the power and potential of NounsDAO just as you do.\n\nWe are proposing a funding of **47,600 USDC** to give a Nounish makeover to a vacation rental property in Tokyo, Japan, valued over $1,000,000 USD. We intend to create “Nouns House #1” with this funding. Our property has already completed interior and exterior renovations; **all of the funding will be used for the Nounish makeover, and development of the mobile app.**\n\nBeyond just providing the property for Nouns House #1, **we will contribute 10% of the profits made from Nouns House #1 to the Nouns House DAO treasury for the first 5 years**. For future Nouns Houses real estates that are funded by the treasury, 100% of the profits will be returned to the treasury.\n\nIn alignment with NounsDAO’s CC0 philosophy, we will make all software and hardware implemented in this project open source. Furthermore, we plan to collaborate with the Nouns projects that are active in Japan such as **[pNouns](https://pnouns.wtf/en/)** (**[Noun 553](https://nouns.wtf/noun/553)**, **[Noun 556](https://nouns.wtf/noun/556)**) for events and promotions.\n\n**The diverse industry experience of our team will significantly contribute to the success of this project.** **[yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth)** is a former executive CPO at Mercari, **[yukill.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukill.eth)** is a former CEO at ZOZO Technologies, **[Jiro](https://twitter.com/jiroisagame)** is a former YouTuber with 1.3 million subscribers, and I, **[tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth)**, am a former engineer from Amazon Seattle.\n\nThis proposal was inspired by **[Nouns Deli](https://twitter.com/NounsDeli)**’s proposal (**[Proposal 254](https://nouns.wtf/vote/254)**, approved on 03/09/2023). Our next step is to establish a Nounish subDAO, called “Nouns House DAO”. Similar to the **[Nouns Builder Protocol](https://nouns.build/)** (**[Proposal 167](https://nouns.wtf/vote/167)**, approved on 11/12/2022), we aim to create a subDAO inheriting NounsDAO’s auction, treasury, and governance system. In the follow-up proposal, we plan to request initial funding for Nouns House DAO treasury, in order to create Nouns House #2 and subsequent Nouns Houses based on community decisions governed by the DAO.\n\n## 1.  Nouns House DAO ⌐◧-◧\n\nNouns House #1 created through this proposal will serve as the first Nouns House governed by Nouns House DAO. Following the successful execution of this proposal, we will submit a follow-up proposal to transfer initial funding to the Nouns House DAO treasury. This initial funding will be substantial enough to secure the purchase of the second Nouns House. The exact amount, along with detailed plans and specific property information, will be disclosed in this follow-up proposal. We believe that having initial funding in the treasury will create strong momentum for this new Nounish DAO.\n\nOur goal is to establish Nouns Houses in major cities globally, allowing individuals to experience Nouns art and culture. Additionally, we aim to **operate this as a profitable venture**, positioning Nouns House DAO as the pioneering Nounish subDAO that introduces a **3rd revenue pillar for the treasury, complementing the NFT auctioning and ETH staking.**\n\nNouns House DAO will oversee the operation and financial management of all Nouns Houses. **As a testament to our commitment, we will contribute 10% of the profits from Nouns House #1 to treasury for the first 5 years.** For all subsequent real estates that are funded by the Nouns House DAO treasury, 100% of the profits will be directed back to the treasury.\n\n![Bedroom](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1W23f_T6aANo9mXh9-lUu3bypKSzU12M4)\n\n## 2. Enabler DAO / Core Team ⌐◧-◧\n\nEnabler DAO is a asset sharing community that aims to facilitate easy sharing of large assets like houses and cars by leveraging blockchain and AI technology. As of November 2023, we operate 10 properties across 5 locations (Tokyo, Kyoto, Atami, Teshikaga, and Honolulu) in Japan and the United States. These properties are monetized through asset sharing within the community as well as through Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) such as Airbnb and Booking.com. Below are some of our properties and links to OTAs.\n\n🇯🇵 [**WHITE HOUSE Atami**](https://airbnb.com/h/white-house-atami\n) - Shizuoka, Japan\n🇯🇵 [**MACHIYA Kyoto**](https://www.kyoto-machiya-inn.com/accommodations/hanatoki/\n) - Kyoto, Japan\n🇯🇵 [**THE NEST Teshikaga**](https://airbnb.com/h/the-nest-teshikaga) - Hokkaido, Japan\n🇺🇸 [**BEACH HOUSE Honolulu**](https://airbnb.com/h/beach-house-honolulu-annex) - Hawaii, USA\n\n![Properties](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1C5UfxmK62s98QryMGZ_SoTIpED1fTUru)\n\nThe 4 founders of Enabler DAO are **[yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth)** (**[Noun 312](https://nouns.wtf/noun/312)**), former executive CPO of Mercari; **[yukill.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukill.eth)**, former CEO at ZOZO Technologies & fund manager for MZ Web3 Fund; **[Jiro](https://twitter.com/jiroisagame)**, former YouTuber “Charisma Brothers” with 1.3 million subscribers & managing partner at iFund; and **[tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth)**, a trilingual former Amazon HQ engineer with 5-years of experience. \n\nEnabler DAO was founded in October 2021, and we currently operate with about 10 DAO members. We have been operating highly successful and profitable vacation rental properties in multiple locations (10~20% annual ROI), and bring expertise in both rental operations and property management. Moreover, our diverse team brings a wide range of business and product development experience, combined with our strong track record, **I believe we are in a unique position to be successful at running the first Nouns House.**\n\n## **3. Nounish Makeover ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe plan to transform our property in Aoyama, an upscale district in Tokyo, into \"Nouns House #1,\" with a Nounish makeover filled with art and goodies. \n\n![Living Room](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bwo_xZOKns30glLVRyeoQ7ROKojrQkIE)\n\nAoyama is a hub of designer boutiques, art galleries, cafes, and shopping districts. It's not only a attracts for affluent individuals but also a popular tourist destination. Given the area's reputation and successful track record of our nearby properties, **we anticipate strong demand for high-end vacation rental property in Aoyama.**\n\n![Sauna](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1kabDge7tB6HDlZqn1fYccFdnsMt0-AdX)\n\nIn recent years, there has been a “sauna boom” in Japan. The number of sauna enthusiasts has been increasing due to heightened health consciousness and the proliferation of sauna facilities. In fact, the number of sauna users in Japan has increased by more than one million in the past year, and high-end sauna facilities in Tokyo are extremely popular. **We believe that Nouns House #1 will become widely popular within the sauna communities and beyond.**\n\n![Bath](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=190MOtkZF68sFwLUJzwbxoO4hNEtKDfch)\n\nThe artwork used for interior and exterior of Nouns House #1 will be directed by [amiyoko.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/amiyoko.eth) who have contributed many artwork to various Nouns projects such as NounsDAO Anniversary Art 2023 and Sushi Nouns.\n\n![Exterior](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bESaiRK3zLewixG-8MvEEq9HgIhnkbqc)\n\nThe 1st floor is the sauna area, the 2nd floor features a living-dining-kitchen area, and the 3rd floor will be an office space and a bedroom. We aim to infuse each floor with Nounish elements while maintaining a sense of luxury in the interior design.\n\n![Chill](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1CvxZml-3RPmPaHxNUzN7yUE2DKu-wLyU)\n\n## 4. Marketing Efforts **⌐◧-◧**\n\nTo amplify the presence of Nouns House #1, **we will be forming a strategic partnership with a popular Japanese YouTuber group, [EvisJap](https://youtube.com/@EvisJap?si=6Oi6Ll6fIzis70ib).** With a subscriber base of 630,000, primarily young adults, they are known for their energetic travel blogs and lively social gatherings that resonate with the adventurous spirit of youth.\n\nDuring the weekdays, EvisJap will be utilizing Nouns House #1 as their recording studio, bringing a creative buzz to the space while providing regular exposure of Nouns to a broad audience through their videos. On weekends, Nouns House #1 will transform into an luxury private sauna. This dual-use approach optimizes the utility of the property, and exemplifies the innovative and adaptive spirit of the Nouns.\n\nThis collaboration, born from our unique relationship with EbisJap, is a synergy that offers exposure to Nouns House without direct marketing efforts. The value of this organic promotion is an example of the unique contribution that our team brings to the Nouns community.\n\n## **5. Mobile App ⌐◧-◧**\n\n**We will develop a mobile app for facilitating reservations and assigning maintenance work for Nouns House DAO**. This app will be powered by open-source framework called **[Skeet](https://skeet.dev/en/)** which seamlessly integrates with Google Cloud Platform and Firebase, making it easier to develop serverless full-stack applications. \n\nIt's worth noting that both Enabler and **[El Soul Labo](https://labo.elsoul.nl/en/)**, the team behind Skeet, received equity funding from **[East Ventures](https://east.vc/)**, one of the biggest venture capital fund in Asia. With the cutting edge Skeet framework and the invaluable support from the creator of Skeet, we can efficiently develop this app with just one engineer on our end.\n\nThe app will integrate with existing tools that offers API such as **[Beds24](https://beds24.com/)** for inventory management, **[Sesame Smart Lock](https://jp.candyhouse.co/)** for automatically issuing one-time guest keys, and **[Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-jp)** for fiat payment processing. In the interim, before our app release, we'll use **[LINE](https://line.me/en/)** and **[LINE Marketplace](https://line-marketplace.com/jp/app)** apps for chat-based reservation.\n\nFurthermore, we will incorporate web3 capabilities such as token-gating and cryptocurrency payment into the app. We plan to offer special coupons and priority reservations to Nouns House NFT holders, and allow payments in major cryptocurrencies.\n\n## **6. Utility Token ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe plan to introduce a utility token which will be used for accessing Nouns House and can be earned through completing maintenance gigs listed in the app. **We envision some members of the Nouns House DAO to work maintenance gigs in order to earn the utility token.** We plan to use Solana chain for the token for 3 reasons: near-zero gas fees, rapid execution, and its integration with the user-friendly multi-chain wallet called Phantom. Enabler DAO has already been experimenting with Solana based utility token called [**EBR**](https://solscan.io/token/E1JxwaWRd8nw8vDdWMdqwdbXGBshqDcnTcinHzNMqg2Y) (available on [**Orca DEX**](https://v1.orca.so/liquidity/browse?tokenMint=E1JxwaWRd8nw8vDdWMdqwdbXGBshqDcnTcinHzNMqg2Y)) and have experience in this realm.\n\n## **7. Roadmap ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe will begin the Nounish makeover and the development of mobile app, immediately following the approval of this proposal. In January 2024, we plan to pre-open Nouns House #1, followed by grand opening in February. Beta version of mobile app will be released in March, followed by production release in April. We will submit submit a follow-up proposal by Feburary 2024 to transfer initial funding for the DAO treasury followed by successful execution of this proposal.\n\n![Roadmap](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1xkl6xzFYEi-rAtpjmnARWpc34Pj_Dlh4)\n\n## **8. Budget ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe are proposing **47,600 USDC funding for creating Nouns House #1 and to kick start the software infrastructure development for Nouns House DAO.** The Nounish makeover will cost $17,000, and the development of the mobile app will cost $30,600. All work will commence immediately upon the approval of the proposal.\n\n**Nouns House #1 Nounish Makeover: $17,000**\n- \"Nounish\" Exterior Wall Art: $6,000\n- \"Nounish\" Interior Art: $8,000\n- \"Nounish\" Goodies: $3,000\n\n**Mobile App (6-month development): $30,600**\n- Founding Engineer: $5,000/month\n- [Skeet](https://skeet.dev/en/) (Enterprise Support): $100/month\n\n## **9. Community Benefits ⌐◧-◧**\n\nThis proposal aims to **expand the Nouns community by creating the first \"Nouns House\", a network of properties where people can experience Nouns art and culture in major cities worldwide.**\n\nIn the next step, we will propose to transfer initial funding for Nouns House DAO treasury. This new Nounish subDAO will own Real World Asset (RWA) and operate them as a profit-making business. RWA is an area where the web3 industry is still struggling, and this new venture has the potential to significantly advance the industry on this front.\n\nNouns House NFT holders will be offered special perks such as discounted rates and priority access to Nouns Houses via token gating. Additionally, upon the funding of the Nouns House DAO treasury in our next proposal, **existing Nouns NFT holders can apply for Nouns House NFT airdrop by a pre-determined date**. This airdrop is optional and provides an opportunity for existing NounsDAO members to participate in the governance for Nouns House DAO without having to bid in the auction.\n\n## **10. CC0 ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe believe, Nouns House’s CC0 culture will bring innovation to the real estate industry. While real estate design and architecture are generally not open-source, we will make all of these publicly available through our CC0 library. CC0 approach will also have a large impact on the vacation rental industry. **By providing tools to help achieve efficient operations, we will accelerate the automation and digital transformation of the vacation rental industry.** The interest and attention that this CC0 model will generate within these industries will serve as the ideal platform for spreading the culture and values of Nouns.\n\n## **11. Risks & Considerations ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe are enthusiastic members of the Nouns community and, as Noun owner, strongly resonate with the vision of Nouns. **We believe that the Nouns model holds innovative power in asset management and vacation rental fields.** This decentralized, community-led governance model has the potential to offer new approaches in asset sharing and feels like the ideal way to manage assets in a decentralized manner. On the other hand, there are some risks considered in achieving the vision of this project:\n\n1. **Regulatory Risk**: Operating within a decentralized framework could potentially make the project subject to regulations. Compliance with local laws is crucial.\n2. **Technical Risk**: The integration of blockchain technology with physical assets like real estate presents several challenges. The implementation of smart contracts to manage the property must be executed flawlessly.\n3. **Community Engagement**: The strength of a DAO lies in its community.
