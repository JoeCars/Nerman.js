I propose an initial investment of 312 ETH into the newly formed \"Nouns House DAO,\" which will be a rebranding of the current Enabler DAO. This investment aims to fortify and grow the entire Nouns ecosystem. This proposal also marks the INO (Initial NFT Offering) of Nouns House DAO.\n\n## üîç What is Enabler DAO?\n\nEnabler DAO is a Tokyo-based decentralized autonomous organization founded by Yuki Hamada, a serial tech entrepreneur and a former executive CPO of Mercari, a unicorn company in Japan. The organization specializes in developing property rental platforms using smart contracts and manages high-end properties in Tokyo, Hawaii, Kyoto, and Hokkaido. Given its successful real estate ventures and its profit-generating business model, Enabler DAO is at a pivotal stage, transitioning into tokenization. This evolution marks the birth of Enabler DAO as a key player in the blockchain and real estate space. Additionally, it is planning to introduce special benefits for NFT holders, such as the ability to rent available properties at discounted rates, leveraging its expertise and existing assets to foster new growth opportunities.\n\n## ‚ùì Why Approve This Proposal?\n- Nouns has transcended its origins as an art project and is now the foundation for various decentralized protocols.\n- We have already launched Nouns House DAO through NounsBuilder, which has undergone a third-party security audit and received community endorsement. The DAO's inaugural auction starts today.\n- I propose the allocation of 312 ETH, symbolizing my ownership of Nouns 312, to kickstart this initiative.\n- Recent case studies indicate that such ecosystem upgrades can drive substantial growth.\n\n## üó≥ Approval and Bidding Process:\n- **Approval:** Vote on the proposal.\n- **Bidding:** The auction will be held [here](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0x7F4Ec49a66D773D63092dbD8FbCDFC71C9D9e2f3).

In return, 1/20th of the founders' share will be allocated to nouns.eth, bringing economic benefits to the Nouns community.\n\n- **Treasury Allocation**: The 312 ETH will be transferred to the Nouns House DAO's treasury, to be utilized for various initiatives in a DAO-governed manner.\n\n- **Future Valuation**: In the 15 days leading up to approval, the next treasury could exceed the current average price of Nouns, indicating high future potential for the project.\n\n- **Momentum from 15-Day Window**: If approved within 15 days, the treasury price per NFT would increase by 20.8 ETH (312/15), adding momentum to Nouns House DAO.\n\n- **Setting a Good Precedent**: This approach could set a good precedent for future DAOs and projects, strengthening the decentralized ecosystem and serving as a model for how existing projects can evolve symbiotically.\n\n\n## üó≥ Approval and Bidding Process:\n- **Approval:** Vote on the proposal.\n- **Bidding:** The auction will be held [here](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0x7F4Ec49a66D773D63092dbD8FbCDFC71C9D9e2f3).

People involved in seemingly different fields, such as social contribution organizations and the web3 community, will gather together with the aim of creating new support and revenue methods that combine social problem solving and web3.\n\n- Simultaneously with the charity event, we will be hosting ‚ÄúNoggles Jack Nagoya‚Äù and the ‚Äúweb3 Community Exhibition,‚Äù expecting over 1,000 attendees. In line with the event, there will be talk sessions, Nouns' booths, workshops, promotional merchandise distributions, and planned social contribution activities.\n\n- Prior to the event, we will have a booth for Nouns at the Design Festa in Tokyo on Sunday, November 12, 2023. Following our previous Proposal 228 ‚ÄúNoggles Jack Tokyo,‚Äù this will be our second event where we will display and sell Nouns merchandise. Moreover, we will also be promoting ‚ÄúBright Any Colors with ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®.‚Äù\n\n## Background & Challenges\n- While individuals possess various facets, society often fails to accept them, because it's easier to manage by measuring everyone against a uniform set of values, leading to a tendency to avoid complexity.\nI believe that the biggest societal issue lies in the attempt to oversimplify intricate matters. Many people in today's society are bound by existing frameworks, having forgotten how to create new concepts and systems on their own accord.\n\n- The utilization of web3 technology for societal transformation is in an trial phase, but leveraging Nouns' autonomous decentralized system has the potential to assist.\nThere's a need for support towards technology that encourages ‚Äúpluralistic‚Äù decision-making and collaboration, as well as the activities that accompany it.\n\n- In October 2022, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities pointed out that Japan's education for persons with disabilities is lagging behind and made [recommendations.](https://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=6QkG1d%2FPPRiCAqhKb7yhsox6sZe%2Fik6d3iDJzISRPhvIaActFR9I%2FAIZ%2Be8dEYc3x9pGI%2BAqnUjiYnhf%2BzLRJLqW2mBzZdcaW0%2B10tvwrA97qOnmCuV89Qwl7dhkmc1B) However, there has been still no progress in understanding and awareness of disabilities, and the separation of special needs education from regular classes has been seen as a problem.\nFurthermore, research and studies on rare and congenital diseases are struggling due to the influence of market principles and an emphasis on efficiency.\n\n- ‚ÄúBright Any Colors‚Äù is aimed at supporting individuals with disabilities, children, and students. Participants will be able to exchange opinions within the event, increasing the potential for new ideas and solutions to emerge.\n\n## Theme & Objectives\n‚ÄúBright Any Colors with ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®‚Äù aims to enjoyably learn about DAOs through Nouns, aspiring to pave the way for a future where everyone shines their brightest. Our passion for enhancing the lives of all resonates with the public, and we've designed this event hoping that the concepts and systems of web3 naturally gain broader recognition. Relying on the insights and experiences from this endeavor, we will continuously engage in activities that leverage web3 technology to address societal challenges. We will host events 3-4 times a year, striving for widespread awareness and education.\n\n## Event Overview\n### Dec 23, 2023 Event & Workshop\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/2.png)\n\n- **A talk session will be held on the stage of the gymnasium.**\nOur special guests for this event will be Ms. Chizuru Azuma, an actor who has been actively involved in social contribution activities for over 30 years, and Mr. paji, a research expert in DAO and Co-Planner at pNouns.\nThe theme will be an explanation of the full-fledged DAO \"Nouns\" and its applicability to social issues.\n„ÄÄ\nFor example‚Ä¶the funding mechanism by Nouns DAO What is \"Treasury Wallet\"?\nWe'll introduce its structure, potential applications, and other real-life examples, all tailored for beginners.\nNouns-related images and videos will be projected using a projector into the visual stage production.\n\n- **Booth exhibition by social contribution organizations.**\nWe will introduce initiatives by organizations supporting people with disabilities, children, and students, as well as employment support facilities, as well as sell products and conduct educational activities.\n\n- **Invited event company \"NFT COLOR\" together the actively active web3 community in Japan Exhibiting NFT art works,** introducing the community, and interacting with social contribution organizations.\n\n### Event Proposal\n#### Various Workshops\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/3.png)\n\nMs. Chizuru Azuma is in charge of the planning, composition, casting, direction, costume design, and overall supervision of the [‚ÄúMAZEKOZE Island Tour,‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waK22pnvFRY) which is being streamed worldwide as one of the events of the ‚ÄúTokyo 2020 NIPPON Festival.‚Äù\n\n[Using the theatrical arts to create a more diverse society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8c-CycBt0M) | Chizuru Azuma | TEDxKyoto\n\n### Location\n#### Nagono Campus\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/4.png)\n[\"Nagono Campus\"](https://nagono-campus.jp/englishguide/) is located in Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture.\n\n### Phase\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/5.png)\n\n### Advatages of simultaneous event in Tokyo and Nagoya\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/6.png)\n\nAt the event \"Noggles Jack Tokyo\" held on May 20th and 21st, 2023, Nouns became widely known to the general public through Noggles.\nAt the charity event \"Bright Any Colors with ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®,\" we will set up a \"Noggles Jack Nagoya\" booth.\nJust like last time, attendees can enjoy Nouns characters and Noggles.

We want to create a database that helps anyone answer these questions, and an example website on top to support a first analysis: *What is the proposer pipeline and how can Nouns best support builders?*\n\nThe database will integrate activity across social channels and highlight which Nouns, advocates, and proposals have best supported the Noun‚Äôs meme propagation. Our data wrangling creative motto is: *Track Memes, Not (just) People.*\n\nAs a starting point, this work will gather the following data: [1] **onchain** activity (supported by the Nouns subgraph) and [2] two sources of social media (**Farcaster** and **Instagram**). This data will be available for others to query and use to investigate additional questions.\n\nWithin the scope of the work, we will also create a basic website including [3] a limited set of **general metrics** for context, and [4] **the first analysis website** focusing on the specific challenge of understanding the proposal conversion process. In this way, we will be the first ‚Äúapp analysis‚Äù built on the dataset.\n\n## Background\n\nAs of the moment, the Nouns‚Äô community and audience members produce a wide variety of data. Over time, more data is likely to migrate onchain (e.g. similar to vote comments today) and data will be produced across even more digital localities. The *United World of Nouns* will have a wide-ranging data footprint. Combining data across these localities can become a powerful tool for proposal development and decision-making.\n\nHowever, as @Krel mentioned in their [Request for Proposers](https://www.notion.so/94dadff999ac493b9902aa002e4b296e?pvs=21):\n\n> *‚ÄúNouns DAO does not have a reliable way to measure ‚Äògrowth‚Äô or ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô. Its not clear what should be measured, or what growth in the context of Nouns even means.‚Äù*\n> \n\nThis project will create an initial repository of activity growth combining onchain and offchain data. We are long overdue to experiment on this front!\n\n## Scope Overview\n\nThe Noun Pulse has two components: \n\n- [A] the open database and\n- [B] a single-purpose website with general metrics and a first analysis\n\nIn addition, we will include an analysis report explaining current trends, issues, and opportunities in the proposer pipeline.\n\nTo begin, we will include onchain data available in the Nouns Subgraph and two social media channels: Farcaster and Instagram. We will then publish a selection of core metrics that provide clarity to Noun holders and the wider community.\n\nMost importantly, the underlying data pool (Meme Activity Database) will serve a step towards a data-driven Nouns culture, which community members and potential builders can use to find opportunities for proposal submissions. This should enable builders to bypass building a new database. Instead, we can amend it, expand it, or fork it. As a result, we can focus our energy on answering new business questions.\n\nSuccess of this project will be measured based on **data pool connections** (e.g. external usage of the Meme Activity Database), **web usage** (unique visitors), and **discussions** or proposals that successfully reference the data.\n\nThis work will enable future analysis to include key derivative NFT projects (Gnars, LilNouns, cc0-lib) and other dominant social spaces (Discord, Discourse, X, Lens, etc).\n\n## Product Components\n\n![Components (1).png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkelSB-7p.png)\n\n### Meme Activity Database (a.k.a. The MAD)\n\nWe‚Äôve named the database the ‚ÄúMeme Activity Database.‚Äù The reason is that we don‚Äôt want to just track people; we want to track *********************************the content*********************************. Our ambition is that this database is an MVP aggregation of all-things Nouns, reliable **meme-data-as-a-service,** such that we can service a variety of new data-powered projects.\n\nAs mentioned, this database will be open source and free access: anyone should be able to contribute to it (e.g. add a new source or table) and build on top of that.\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to facilitate the use of data across the Nouns ecosystem. As the cc0 library enables media usage, the activity database enables tracking and impact analysis.\n\nThe Web API interface will be available publicly  distributed per specific sources (onchain Nouns, Farcaster, and others) as well as in aggregated form to enable the development of tools such as alerts, bots, and analytics dashboards.\n\nData will be synchronized in real-time directly from the Nouns‚Äô Subgraph, Farcaster, Instagram to an SQL database. The sync mechanism will be architected in a uniform adapter interface for easier future integration with other onchain data and offchain sources, such as Twitter, Discourse, Discord, Telegram, DeSo, and Lens.\n\n## The Noun Pulse Website: General Metrics\n\nWe believe that many Noun community members have a variety of needs. We will supply an overview of general metrics to serve as a source of truth for conversations.\n\nThese include:\n\n**Example Onchain Metrics, Supporting Clarity on Arbitrage**\n\n- Treasury\n- Treasury Usage Rate (Monthly Spend)\n- Burn Value\n- Estimated Burn Value at Next Fork\n- Average Auction Price\n- Current Arbitrage Opportunity (3-day average auction price minus value at next fork)\n- Count of Unique Holders\n- Count of Active Holders (Unique Holders with Vote w/ Reason in past 30 days)\n\n**Example Proposer Pipeline Metrics, Supporting Clarity in Builder Ecosystem**\n\n- Proposer Pipeline (with addresses and available contact information, details in next section)\n- Conversion Rates from Stage to Stage\n- Excerpts of Builder Stories\n- Count of Prop House Submissions\n- Count and % of Prop House Submissions from New Builders\n- Count and % of Passes Prop House Submissions\n- Count of Candidates\n- Count and % of Candidates from New Builders\n- Count and % of Candidates converting to Onchain Proposals\n- Count of Proposals\n- Count and % of Proposals from New Builders\n- Count and % of Passed Proposals\n- Count of Unique Proposers\n- Count of Unique Funded Builders\n- Growth in Onchain Comments\n    - Growth in Candidate Feedback\n    - Growth in Prop Vote with Reason\n    - Growth in Prop Updates\n\n**Example Offchain Metrics, Supporting Clarity in Nouns Reach**\n\n- Number of Posts\n- Total Engagement (Likes+Comments+Shares)\n- Engagement Rate (Ratio of Engagement to Posts)\n- Most Engaged Content\n- Total Followers\n- Total Followers with Onchain Identity\n- Follower Growth Rate (Updated based on API opportunity)\n\n***Representative Image of General Metrics***\n\nThe design for the website will use assets from the cc0 library and default Noun design parameters from the main website noun.wtf\n\n![Screenshot 2023-11-02 at 16.52.43.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyTCrHWm6.png)\n\n## Alpha Analysis Report: The Proposer Pipeline\n\nThe first iteration of the database will be focused to help address a key opportunity in the Nouns DAO: **attracting, shepherding, and retaining quality builders**. The data we select and analyze will be guided by this problem statement.\n\n### **Analysis Context and Design**\n\nEvery DAO has a funnel of builder activity. In the case of Nouns, we can roughly organize the participation process as:\n\n![Proposer Journey Graphic (1).png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H10ZHHWQT.png)\n\n1. Aware (Saw Nouns)\n2. Curious (Engaged with Nouns, Offchain)\n3. Audience (Engaged with Nouns, Onchain)\n4. Voter (Vote with Reason)\n5. Prop House Submitter (Submitted to the Garden)\n6. Prop House Funded (Proposal Passed)\n7. Candidate (Submitted Candidate Proposal)\n8. Onchain Proposer (Submitted Onchain Proposal)\n9. Funded Builder (Proposal Passed)\n10. Committed Builder (Completed Proposal)\n11. Multi-Proposal Builder (Multiple Proposals Passed)\n\n---\n\nHowever, we currently don‚Äôt have clarity on the people involved throughout this proposal process, or where Nouns can focus on to coach builders and retain them. \n\nAs Noun40 describes in this proposal‚Äôs feedback, there are many open questions. \n\nSome of ours include:\n\n- How many of the candidate props are from net new ppl?\n- Of the net new ppl, do their candidate props grow to be full props that pass (success cases)\n- How did those prop builders find us? (number will be so small you could just ask them)\n    - *Note: We will document stories where data is not available*\n- What is the number of ppl that commented on the candidate proposal?\n- Is that quantity and participant of candidate feedback growing?\n- Are prop house builders in the garden round then submitting candidate proposals? If not, why?\n- Are builders returning to submit new proposals? If not, why?\n\nAt the end of the day, ***‚Äúwe want more net new quality prop builders and we want them to have success and a low drop off rate.‚Äù (Noun40)***\n\nOur team would add: **we want those quality builders to come back.**\n\n---\n\nUsing this framework as a starting point, we can analyze the data, create different visuals, and validate the journey hypothesis. We understand this may not be trivial and some data or identity mapping may not be available. Data will be complimented with builder stories.\n\n![Screenshot 2023-11-02 at 16.50.42.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJFvSrbXT.png)\n\n### **Analysis Considerations**\n\nAs part of the deliverable, we will also include documented business rules underlying the analysis. For example, we will include what means if a builder is net-new. This is not necessarily trivial since we want to avoid counting an ethereum address as ‚Äúnet-new‚Äù if it‚Äôs the same builder but submitting an application with a new ethereum address.\n\nEach of these business rules will be discussed openly throughout the work to ensure the Noun community has opportunity to provide feedback.\n\n### **Analysis Outputs: A Written Report**\n\nCreating graphs and metrics is not enough for action. As a result, the scope of the analysis will include a **written report (In Notion or similar)** with recommendations. \n\nThe intention is to test out the usefulness of the database and the website ‚Äî to build for action. In this case, we will understand where the proposer pipeline issues are, support them with data, and provide tangible advice. \n\nFor example, insights may include ways to identify potential builders earlier, and help them find a Noun-sponsor prior to a candidate proposal submission; imagine if another group of Nouns community members (not just holders), offered to shepherd builders in the proposal process, similar to gardeners. \n\nThese insights will be framed as RFPs (**Request for Proposals**), such that the Nouns community has clearer direction on where to invest to strengthen the proposer pipeline.\n\n## Product Roadmap\n\nThe execution of this project will be done in an iterative fashion. By building in public and getting ongoing feedback, we can deliver what the community needs, and data that will support Nouns decisions.\n\n**Iterative Phases:**\n\n- **Phase 1:** Deliver alpha analysis plan outline and approach. Deliver mock-up UI for web application. Deliver database raw data components and MVP. Host open Q&A with Nouns (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 2:** Deliver basic UI w/ metrics. Deliver initial list of insights from analysis. Provide update on database.

Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to celebrate launch and discuss future analytics (where next?).\n\n## An Ambitious Vision\n\nThis project aims to uncover what ‚ÄúNouns-Native‚Äù analytics could look like, and what data infrastructure is necessary to feed this analytics into the broader Nouns governance and participation process.\n\nWe‚Äôre certain there will be other innovations along the way. After all, we need to address challenges in crossing the web3-to-web2 data pipeline chasm. Is it possible? We think so.\n\nFortunately, the team is not alone. They have a wide array of connections with governance leaders across the DAO space: Optimism, Purple, Forefront, Radworks, SeedClub, FWB, Cabin, and others.\n\nNouns is a place for ambitious ideas, and we are an ambitious team.\n\n## Team\n\nThis project will be led and executed by Rafa Fernandez (Farcaster: @rafa) and Rafi Gutkowski (Farcaster: @rafi). \n\n- Rafa Fernandez is a community architect with a focus on building [Digital Public Utilities](https://www.notion.so/General-Networks-e4615b9b52294f8bab34a82b47023d11?pvs=21). He has decade of experience in corporate analytics and studied materials-science and engineering. He is the founder of Folklore (Folklore.Institute), a community that curates and commissions research on digital cultures. Most recently, he was part of the Summer of Protocols research program looking at [online swarms](https://www.notion.so/41c114211ac045f087c44c16bd993748?pvs=21). Previous to the program he worked at Mirror where he worked in creator partnerships and community development.\n- Rafi Gutkowski is a software engineer and data scientist ([libred.org](https://libred.org/), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/rgutkowski)). He is building [Farway](http://farway.org), a Farcaster meta-client for social analytics. He started mining bitcoin in 2015 but only after exiting from his recent startup, did he double down on web3. Since then Rafi has been working on sementic analysis of decentralized social graphs, as well as creating web3-web2 bridges, such as Folklore‚Äôs web3-signature to feed [broadcast applet](https://www.notion.so/Folklore-5d34757913064064b87119c4593eda74?pvs=21).\n\n## Funding\n\nWe are a stream of 22.5 ETH to fund this project over 10 weeks.\n\nThe funds will be allocated to a two-person team (Rafa and Rafi). They are split roughly 25-75 between planning and iterative engineering. There is about a 40-40-10 between data engineering, analysis + visuals, and handoff. There is approximately 10% reserved for bugs and issue resolution.\n\nWe expect that once the initial traunch of data engineering and visuals is complete, then we can make a decision on what the community needs more of (if anything), such as expanded data, or expanded analysis\n\n## Our Commitments\n\n- We commit to posting updates on¬†[updates.wtf](https://updates.wtf/)¬†with sprint plan and outcomes, in alignment with each of the community Q&A feedback sessions.\n- We commit to cancelling the stream based on community feedback.\n- We commit to executing this work as an open-source project, such that other onchain communities and organizations can benefit.\n\n## Other Notes\n\nThis proposal was built based on the Basic Nouns Proposal Template, built by Rafa and available here: https://hackmd.io/@rafathebuilder/BkPAmHZbp\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to learn more about this proposal, the first Q&A conversation on Aburra is available here: https://youtu.be/_dr2yZulMGU"},{"blockNumber":18502645,"blockHash":"0x333358dc41c96677a1765b9ccc67c7a11c2365ba7dfbb4b33d24c768187bbef3","transactionIndex":121,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x8145fa149fd43e03751870c36f67b99fb481c4eea0fc9a7ce34a368355081b8b","eventName":"ProposalDescriptionUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalDescriptionUpdated(uint256,address,string,string)","id":430,"proposer":"0x7c1282a7621F0e2f6169E151628552A8B8a57B2d","description":"# CC0 Nouns Themed Playground + Build : Spread Nouns Design And Ideology Worldwide Through Fun And Play\n\n### **[UPDATE]**\nThis is a version 2 of [[Prop 408: First IRL Nouns Themed Playground]](https://nouns.wtf/vote/408) where we have input more details based on feedback received.\n\nAlso to show our resolve, we've worked on the detailed design and have it build out as well.

Create a large scale tangible Nounish **Public Good**.\n2. To attract a **new subgroup** of creatives & audience to Nouns.\n3. To achieve **self-sustaining long term** proliferation globally via the distribution and adoption of cc0 Nouns themed play-structures design.\n\n![A3Dgxek.png](https://i.imgur.com/A3Dgxek.png)\n\n**As a builder in Nouns:**\n1. To inspire community members to **leverage their networks** and create impactful proposals.\n2. Become an **enabler for Nouns community** to ease interactions with both well-established brands and non-crypto organizations.\n3. Showcase the **versatility** of Nouns' cc0 assets.\n\n**Strategy (Focus on long-term continuity):**\n- Use this Nouns Themed Playground as a monument that compliment the open-source design kit.  \n    - Showcase the design and instill trust in its playability.\n    - Distribute open-source design to at least 10 industry professionals and **incorporate** our Nouns themed play-structures **in their product catalogs**\n    - Expand Nouns network value and **boost adoption** of Nouns themed play-structures.\n    - Scale Nouns themed play-structures organically\n- Submit this Nouns Themed Playground project to architecture platform like [ArcDaily](https://www.archdaily.com/); to **gain attention from new audience** into Nouns.\n*(we are already in contact with ArcDaily CN curator)*\n    - Open-source design kit will be uploaded but not limited to: github, cco-library, platform like Arcdaily, Bimstore, etc.\n    - Allowing anyone who can build it in their region to plug and build easily.\n- Apart from a **high quality documentary** to tell our story, we will also leverage on media partners.\n    - Sharing BTS footage as short format videos, to **rally attention,** **enhance curiosity**, bringing fans along on this journey, as we show progression and erect our first Nouns Themed Playground.\n        - Content will be shared on but not limited to: X, Farcaster, IG, Tiktok, Youtube, Little Red Book, etc.\n        - New fans are also able to ask questions about Nouns along this journey.\n    - Prop progression will also be shared and updated timely on [Propdates.wtf](https://www.propdates.wtf/)\n\n## **Nouns Themed Play-Structures**\nOn top of the initial batch of play-structures, we will also identify **additional 4 Nouns characters** with the design team. These will also be created into play structures and release as part of our open-source design kit, to provide a more **diverse range** of play options which would help boost adoption.    \n\nBelow are the initial batch of play-structure design:\n![PvesMIo.png](https://i.imgur.com/PvesMIo.png)\n![fixz9u4.png](https://i.imgur.com/fixz9u4.png)\n![YkWRXSB.png](https://i.imgur.com/YkWRXSB.png)\n![djZZ0Ad.png](https://i.imgur.com/djZZ0Ad.png)\n\n![iUgJbGz.png](https://i.imgur.com/iUgJbGz.png)\n![gkAgf1V.png](https://i.imgur.com/gkAgf1V.png)\n\n![plrxaMQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/plrxaMQ.png)\n\n![nnoE35D.png](https://i.imgur.com/nnoE35D.png)\n![1ntFyVf.png](https://i.imgur.com/1ntFyVf.png)\n![Z0XcwVm.png](https://i.imgur.com/Z0XcwVm.png)\n![TOfLCiK.png](https://i.imgur.com/TOfLCiK.png)\n![6B1HsP6.png](https://i.imgur.com/6B1HsP6.png)\n![FAesqnE.png](https://i.imgur.com/FAesqnE.png)\n\n\n### **Site Visual**\n![pPKg3fq.png](https://i.imgur.com/pPKg3fq.png)\n![RyDHDCm.png](https://i.imgur.com/RyDHDCm.png)\n\n## **FAQ:**\n**1. Is this playground open to public?**\nYes! This will be a public playground that is accessible to everyone; a large scale tangible Nounish public good.\n\n**2. Is the land for the themed playground secured?**\nYes! We have secured a 2000sqm plot of land beside Element 6 to construct this themed playground.\n\n**3. What is Element 6?**\nElement 6, located in Guangzhou, is a recreational hub with a diverse range of indoor and outdoor activities, include but not limited to go-karting, rock climbing, surf simulator and more; drawing an average monthly footfall of 800,000 visitors. It operates as a subsidiary under the XiangNeng Investment conglomerate.\n\n*Click on the image below to watch their introduction.*\n[![804iyWZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/804iyWZ.png)](https://youtu.be/IlRq1ZJtYPA)\n**4. Are there any liability concerns?**\nLiabilities are covered under Element 6's insurance that enveloped both indoor and outdoor activities.\n\n**5. Will we encounter any permit issues?**\nElement 6 owns the land and it is commercially zoned, where the proposed construction work aligns with zoning regulations. We've also conducted due diligence, including consulting with the authorities, and received verbal approval thus, we are confidence in obtaining the final official approval in a timely manner.\n\n**6. Can this prop be done in phases?**\nProgressing in phases to protect the DAO's interest is an ideal approach; however, the land allocation offered to us isn't available in perpetual for gradual proposals process. Therefore, we've structured the funding in a manner that allow us to commit to this project with an initial release, while the rest is released via stream as we progress, which the DAO can halt if any unforeseen issues arise.\n\n**7. Why not just fund the design of the play-structures?**\nFunding open-source product is Nounish; however, it's wasteful without utilization, and its impact is diminished in the absence of (in this case) tangible play-structure to showcase actual playability and potential. The physical Nouns Themed Playground would help facilitate the propagation of such reusable components to other location & industry professionals with greater effectiveness.\n\n**8. How is this prop scalable?**\nPlayground equipment had a market share of $4.91 billion in 2022, with a projected increase to $9.65 billion by 2030, reflecting a 7% CAGR from 2023 to 2030. This highlights a linear growth in this market.\n\nThe physical Nouns themed playground would allow us to showcase and build trust with industry professionals, allowing us to share our open-source designs with them, to have them integrate Nouns themed play-structures into their product catalogs confidently. We are able to promote open-source while at the same time allowing us to **leverage on their clientele and this growing market, boosting adoption** of Nouns themed play-structures in playgrounds worldwide, given the preference for catalog-based designs by most clients.\n\n\nFurthermore, anyone, especially builders in Nouns community can also use this activation as a monument to ease interaction with their local town that do not have playground or intent to build a playground, to eventually plug and build a Nouns Themed Playground using the open-source design.\n \n## **Budget**\n\n**[UPDATE]**\n*We've secured a new contractor for the design and fabrication of our Nouns themed play-structure, reducing cost by 12%.*\n\n### **Allocation**\nThe total proposed budget is **594,850 USD** for 6mths duration, with an allocation as follows:\n\n**1. Construction: 522,850 USDC**\n* Immediate release: **200,000 USDC**\n* Remaining via *Stream 1*: **80,712.5 x 4 = 322,850 USDC**\n     \n**2.

If you include our various other nounish Spaces as well, the total year-to-date jumps to 857 Spaces, which equates to 921 total hours on air, or a total of **38 full days of broadcasting nounish content**, with a total of **37,800** cumulative listeners. \n\n[![spaces-stats-red-bg.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/d1xdLB4R/spaces-stats-red-bg.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/wyD3rhK3)\n*YTD stats from Superspaces.ai*\n\nOn top of our daily Spaces participation, we have seen tremendous X/Twitter timeline engagement from the TNS community on our art contests, video content and other daily posts, with an impressive **5.9 Million impressions** so far year to date, which equates to nearly 20,000 impressions, 215 Likes and 112 Re-Posts per DAY. We've also completely organically grown our following by almost 100% to **9100 followers**, which makes us the largest nounish account by follower count on X after @nounsdao and our friends at @nounsesports.   \n\n[![spaces-stats-copy-fixed-full-year.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/SKbTM93h/spaces-stats-copy-fixed-full-year.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/FYGVtYhW)\n*YTD stats from X.com*\n\n\n\n---\n\nIn addition to serving as a consistent and reliable content hub for Nouns fans, we have also strived to be **a helpful media liaison to nounish subDAOs and funded Nouns projects**, helping to coordinate and host Twitter/X events, Discord events and more, and generally amplify their messaging to our network.\n\n**Some examples of this kind of community support:**\n- Supporting the \"Nouns: A Movie\" team by coordinating and hosting a watch party for their Rise of Blus Episode 1 Premiere, and amplifying their various announcements and initiatives like open casting calls, etc.\n- Supporting the Nouns AI pod by cohosting a weekly Update Call in our Discord that was free for anyone to join and keep up to date on what that team was building, as well as general news from the AI space. **([Example archive recording.](https://youtu.be/iKzf5ALz01A?si=Ajb4lsPNkOIGJANz))** We also produced this **[awesome video](https://x.com/TheHeroShep/status/1714689055248838840?s=20)** summarizing everything Nouns AI accomplished in 2023. \n- Supporting Nouns Esports by amplifying various contests and announcements, co-hosting weekly Twitter/X Spaces, and hosting a live **[watch party](https://x.com/nounsesports/status/1717691609356132612?s=20)** by request during their TI12 faceoff against Gaiman Gladiators.\n- Collaborating with Nouns Agora to host a **[Nouns Governance Discussion](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40thenounsquare%20%40nounsagora&src=typed_query&f=live)** most weeks on X Spaces with Yitong.\n- Supporting Brennen's **[Tavern project](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1717724845188796846?s=20)** by recently moving one day per week of Noun O' Clock LIVE to tavern.fm. (Not a Nouns-funded project per se, but Brennen is a Nouner and we like the duck.)  \n- Collaborating with Lil Nouns DAO's The Lil Nouns Show, and producing a feature video on their funded Lil Bevs proposal (tentative release date late November.)\n- Collaborating with subDAOs such as Lil Nouns DAO, Gnars, Food Nouns, Nouns Amigos, Nouns Japan, NounsCN, Nouns BR and more to host and cohost regular spaces for their communities.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Discovering and Empowering Nounish Artists:**\n\nOur art contests have continued to be very popular in terms of engagement, and also continue to impress in terms of quality and quantity of output. Here are a couple examples of winning entries from some of our many art contests this year:\n\n**Nounish Halloween Contest**\n\n[![halloween-contest-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/wBDnZ878/halloween-contest-gif.gif)](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1719770338379141525?s=20)\n\n**TNS Anniversary Art Contest Winners**\n\n[![anniversary-contest-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/28nVS3qP/anniversary-contest-gif.gif)](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1668684529484148736?s=20)\n\n\n\nWe constantly see new people tuning into our Spaces and engaging with our content, asking questions about Nouns, etc. in the days following an art contest. This is part of the reason why we have centered the vision of our upcoming Yellow Collective launch around funding and empowering as many nounish artists and creatives as possible (more below.)\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Crowd-Sourced \"FOMO\" Auction Settling:**\n\nSpeaking of art, another way that TNS has contributed to the Nouns ecosystem is by making a fun daily spectacle of choosing the new Noun of the Day on Noun O' Clock LIVE. \n\nWith the help of our audience, we have settled some pretty amazing Nouns this year, including some special ones for occasions, such as a Halloween Ghost, a Birthday Cake for Aug 8, a Black Cat for Token 666, etc. Some of these aesthetic Nouns have sold at auction for above-average prices, even despite the fork dynamic. Noun 658 (Dark Factory) for example **sold for 51 ETH, a full 25 ETH more than the average Noun was going for at that time.**\n\nWe also challenged ourselves earlier this year to try and mint every unminted Noun head, and succeeded just prior to the 2nd Nouniversary. We then challenged ourselves again to mint all the newly added heads as quickly as possible, and succeeded in less than 2 weeks. As a result, **[Proposal 401](https://nouns.wtf/noun/904)** was able to award every contributing artist an existing Noun with their own created head. \n\nHere is a small selection of the many very aesthetic Nouns we helped to mint so far this year: \n\n[![aesthetic-nouns.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/vB6qcD16/aesthetic-nouns.gif)](https://postimg.cc/0MPd4k08)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n# 2) A Fresh Focus on Video Content:\n\nDuring the earliest months of this season, TNS was producing and facilitating an average of 40 Twitter/X Spaces per week for various nounish communities. We sought and received feedback from nouners and our audience, and learned that their favorite content was our educational/informative video content on YouTube and TikTok, and so we decided as a team to shift our resources and attention towards **increasing the production of this kind of rich media content on a more regular basis.**\n\nSince that time, we have been producing an average of 5-8 high quality pieces of video content per month. Here are some notable examples of content produced by TNS this year: \n\n\n\n---\n\n**This Week in Nouns** Series (FKA Prop Talk): A 3 minute weekly video summarizing everything exciting that's happening in Nouns. Primarily an **[X-native release](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40thenounsquare%20%22this%20week%20in%20nouns%22&src=typeahead_click)**, these have received a combined **70,000+ views** so far this year.\n\n[![twin-gif-for-prop.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/D0Mn1F5S/twin-gif-for-prop.gif)](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1709595587232890942?s=20)\n*(Click GIF to Watch Video)*\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Crypto Advocacy / Gitcoin:** Nouns doesn't celebrate its wins often enough, so we decided to make a **[short video about our 100K donation to the Gitcoin Crypto Advocacy Round.](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1678837682565152770?s=20)** This piece of evergreen content has received nearly **30,000 views so far.** \n\n[![gitcoin-gif-for-prop.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/T2qk1ChX/gitcoin-gif-for-prop.gif)](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1678837682565152770?s=20)\n*(Click GIF to Watch Video)*\n\n---\n\n**Nouns AI pod** asked us to produce an engaging video about everything they had built in 2023.

We hope to continue this momentum into Season 3 and **surpass 1 million+ video views over the next 6 months.**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n# 3) The Zero Rights Reserved Podcast: Early Signs of Success\n\n[![zero-rights-reserved-intro-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/bJRYx7HT/zero-rights-reserved-intro-gif.gif)](https://postimg.cc/sQvRy0LQ)\n\n[**Zero Rights Reserved**](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/toady-hawk) is a weekly video podcast that we launched in June as part of our renewed focus on creating more rich digital media. It is a podcast about Nouns, DAOs, Ethereum, Art and more, and our goal is to interview interesting guests from around the onchain space from a Nounish perspective, while entertaining and educating our audience and bridging gaps to other like-minded communities. \n\nSo far, the podcast has been getting very good feedback from listeners both inside and outside the nouns community, as well as from the guests that we have hosted so far:\n\n[![zeropod-feedback.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fW785HM2/zeropod-feedback.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/V569kWrn)\n\n[![farcaster-feedback-2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/K85yPcFG/farcaster-feedback-2.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/zy3M5rV6)\n\n**Here is the list of our incredible guests so far:**\n- **[Jack Butcher](https://youtu.be/V4raMn3pCjQ?si=WcWJ-6vuUY9W3T26)** (Checks, Opepen, Visualize Value)\n- **[Bob Burnquist](https://youtu.be/2E13m-nsD9U?si=0c5uJ9vO3_q3y_6a)** (Skateboarding Legend)\n- **[Dan Romero](https://youtu.be/l4K9B53F8w0?si=JCVlUbBl5oi8JDI1)** (Farcaster Founder)\n- **[Luca Netz](https://youtu.be/HUZe7z_EORs?si=-pwrmaolOemr1e-Y)** (CEO Pudgy Penguins)\n- **[Chris Waters and Eric Towner](https://youtu.be/05B5BsWHF44?si=r6kLBMXPMU7eLmF7)** (Stoopid Buddy)\n- **[Supriyo](https://youtu.be/4RRQ_GqOzq8?si=-d9W9HqPs3zJE-Eg)** (Atrium, Nouns: A Movie)\n- **[Nate Angell](https://youtu.be/leNyYe4k6MA?si=B8hRbrK2eB3k5Rpz)** (Creative Commons)\n- **[Azeem Khan and Ben West](https://youtu.be/fAPxyHl_Yhk?si=TDOR3I66ntRPvAxt)** (Gitcoin)\n- **[Chris Carella](https://youtu.be/3JjblckvKZI?si=Zz7JZ4ppERV8-wQE)** (Purple, Energy)\n- **[Psych](https://youtu.be/1f6sUZlL1wE?si=ZUen2zhbXLWFeOl6)** (Cofounder Deadfellaz)\n- **[Snax](https://youtu.be/4xIL4vooNfM?si=sm57AU-X03NPQyad)** (Founder, Pizza DAO)\n- **[CryptoPunk Noah](https://youtu.be/lka91nApcc0?si=HAd6GsbRJ9oeMPAo)** (Artist, Prev Christie's, Yuga)\n- **[Amanda Terry](https://youtu.be/cD7J6QdrK28?si=cdOTMEiIsJ-XECw5)** (Cofounder, OnChainMonkey)\n- **[Aubtoshi](https://youtu.be/rrthX1cUxJY?si=WwVkI1h7PE3vbAwk)** (Nouns OTG)\n- **[Ed Balloon](https://youtu.be/1f6sUZlL1wE?si=Wbtabhx64GkXqUYI)** (Artist, Musician)\n- **[Binji Pande](https://youtu.be/V4raMn3pCjQ?si=fro8Y-Fbf1_oeS_B)** (Optimism Collective, OPLabs)\n\n*Upcoming guests (already recorded): Vinnie Hager, Grace and Brian Guan (founders of Unlonely.)*\n\n\n[![optimized-zzr-16-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/RFWGKmBr/optimized-zzr-16-gif.gif)](https://postimg.cc/njtvf6rT)\n\n\n\n**ZEROPOD** has also proven to be our most popular piece of recurring video content so far, racking up over **350K impressions across TNS socials for the first 16 episodes.** Podcast subscriptions and downloads are all steadily growing, and from a human-impact perspective, the initiative has been a great bridge to other values-aligned communities such as **Gitcoin, Checks/Opepen, Deadfellaz, OnChainMonkey, Optimism and more.** We have started to see more and more people from these other communities joining Noun O' Clock LIVE regularly to learn more about Nouns after having their interest piqued by the pod! \n\nOur goal for this next season is to continue to grow the podcast, **exceeding 1 million views across our socials for all episode content**, while continuing to attract similar high-caliber guests, and spending more resources on repurposing this abundance of nounish content into shorter vertical videos for use on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube shorts. \n\nWe have also been minting each episode of ZEROPOD as a special ONCHAIN collection on Zora using the Zora L2 network. **[You can check them out and mint them all for free here.](https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x20035fea4dd659553233fe5ea3ca207e6427b5eb)**\n\nLike all of our content at TNS, and as the name would imply, Zero Rights Reserved is fully CC0, and we have started to compile a simple repository of both raw and edited footage that anyone is free to use however they see fit. **You can view and use the repository[ here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bu09bV8M0DwiPQyWhU9lTE7cI2vJT34r?usp=sharing)**\n\n**We believe ZEROPOD has the potential to become our co-flaship production alongside Noun O' Clock LIVE. The former bringing in nouns-curious eyeballs from all over the web 3 space, while the latter acts as an effective sieve to catch artists and creatives and help them find ways to contribute meaningfully to the community.**\n\n\n\n---\n\n# 4) A Note About Team Adaptability\n\nAs mentioned previously, in the early part of this year, TNS was managing and facilitating up to 40 Twitter Spaces per week for communities such as Gnars, Lil Nouns, Unouns, Nouns Amigos, and more via our **SoapBox Program**. \n\nWhile we do maintain that the SoapBox program was impactful, and was certainly appreciated in many corners of the nouniverse, it also demanded a **lot** of labor to maintain in terms of scheduling, administration, social media messaging, hosting and coordination. As we started to receive feedback from Nouns DAO members that they did not feel SoapBox should be a primary focus for TNS, we made the difficult decision to mostly wind it down.\n\nSo as not to leave our communities in the lurch, we did the social media equivalent of making SoapBox \"open source\": We created a new X account called **TNS OpenMic**, where any nounsfolk can apply to host a show about any nounish community or topic of their choosing. We will still amplify where possible, but without the previous commitment of in-house scheduling, messaging, hosting, etc. Our vision for OpenMic is that it can act as a Public Access Channel for Nouns, where anyone can show up and spin up a Space with a built-in audience to iterate and try things out, but without the high administrative burden on TNS.\n\nAs a result of these and other changes to our day-to-day operations, we were able to stretch our previous mandate from 6 months to 9 months, and are presenting today a proposal that is almost 60% leaner than previoius asks.  \n\n\n\n---\n\n# 5) Promising Progress on Self-Funding & Alternative Funding Sources\n\nOne of our primary goals in Season 2 was to explore alternate sources of funding to become more self-sufficient as an organization, and we have explored this priority from three main angles: 1) Sponsorship collaborations, 2) Grants from other sources, and 3) Crypto Native revenue generation. \n\nOn item 1, we were able to negotiate 4 collaborations with values-aligned organizations plus a one-off video commission, for a total ETH value of 5.5 ETH. Thank you to Dawn Wallet, Gnars DAO and OnChainMonkey for being open to these collaborations so far. We are currently in discussions with various other organizations and protocols as well for future month-long content sponsorship opportunities. \n\nSecondly, we were extremely grateful to be awarded a Gitcoin Public Goods grant of 2.5 ETH for outstanding work in Web 3 Education and Onboarding, and a 5 ETH grant from Builder DAO to seed the imminently launching Yellow Collective treasury with funds to be used for nounish art contests and content commissions.\n\nAnd finally, we have brought in a total of 9.14 ETH YTD from our NOMO Nouns Daily Edition mints over the course of Season 2. We have also been iterating and evolving the NOMO collection and experience to make it more accessible for our audience. This summer, we migrated the collection to the Optimism L2 to solve the problem of a $7 daily mint that was costing $50 in gas to mint. Recently, we also made the decision to lower the mint cost from ~$7 to ~$1 to again encourage more broad participation from our community on a daily basis. \n\nWith these four sources combined, we have so far raised **22.14 ETH in outside revenue and grants, and we hope to double this amount in Season 3.**\n\nOne way that we will attempt to do that is with the launch of The Yellow Collective, a new TNS onchain club that will be deployed this month as a daily nounish auction on the BASE L2 using Nouns Builder. \n\n\n\n---\n\n# 6) Nouns on the OP Stack\n\n[![op-stack-infinity-stones-meme.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/j5LfcxDh/op-stack-infinity-stones-meme.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/JDCt4Wcy)\n\nWe noticed an interesting problem when talking to our community: Many wanted to \"Enjoy Ethereum\", but they were fed up with paying high gas fees on mainnet to do so. We decided to make it part of our mandate to teach our 50,000+ followers across socials about the benefits of using OP Stack L2 chains, and show them exactly how to do it.\n\nFirst, we migrated our daily edition collection \"NOMO Nouns\" from mainnet to OP, and produced some helpful tutorials on how to bridge ETH. Next, we started minting our Zero Rights Reserved podcasts as FREE mint collectibles on Zora L2 (shout out Jacob for helping us with this rollout.) \n\nFinally, we are in the midst of launching a \"DAO\" (onchain club) on BASE L2 using Nouns Builder this month, called The Yellow Collective. This Collective will be primarily focused on empowering artists and creatives through art contests and commissions, with collection art created by our community for our community. Check out the results of our **[Prop House Round for the first 50 heads here](https://prop.house/the-yellow-collective/the-yellow-collective-trait-contest-1:-best-noun-heads)**, and learn more about our plans for The Yellow Collective, and the BASE-deployed \"Collective Nouns\" daily auctions in our **[official announcement thread here.](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1704895027401417019?s=20)**\n\nThis diagram may also help to illustrate our three-pronged strategy for educating the Nouns community about the OP Stack, and the importance of Ethereum L2s:\n[![cr-w-2480-h-1240.webp](https://i.postimg.cc/mkHSPzMh/cr-w-2480-h-1240.webp)](https://postimg.cc/dZJCX05K)\n\n\nOne of our core ideals as an organization is to help create a safe and accessible place for people from all over the world to be able to Enjoy Nouns, and we are excited to leverage these L2 initiatives to do exactly that.  \n\nAnd on top of that, we're also just very excited for these Collective Nouns auctions to start... just look at these community-drawn traits! \n\n[![yellow-collective-finalists.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/65L0kWhh/yellow-collective-finalists.gif)](https://prop.house/the-yellow-collective/the-yellow-collective-trait-contest-1:-best-noun-heads)\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Our Guiding Goals for Season 3:\n\n- Remain consistent with our daily Twitter/X spaces and continue our current upward trajectory of followers and engagement on that platform, which would bring us to more than 14,000 followers, and a 6-month total of 1 million+ content impressions.\n- Experiment with moving more of our daily NOC events to alternative venues like tavern.fm and Aburra (Farcaster client) to diversify audience and reduce deplatforming risk.\n- Grow and improve both the podcast and our YouTube channel content (which is already the second-largest channel in the nouniverse with 450 subscribers and also the fastest-growing channel with 150% subscriber growth this year.) We are targeting a similar rate of growth to hit our goal of 1000 Subscribers. As a baseline, we plan to produce and distribute at least 30 high quality pieces of video content in Season 3. \n- As part of this video strategy, we plan to produce high quality project profile content on Nouns-funded and Nouns ecosystem projects like Nouns Esports, Lil Bevs and Nouns Builder, similar to this piece we made about **[Nouns AI](https://youtu.be/dvRuodQLXoc?si=sEaw9KVPV6DpK2Rk)**\n- Make Zero Rights Reserved our co-flagship production alongside Noun O' Clock LIVE, leaning into the current momentum. (We have already recorded 1 month of future episodes with exciting guests like Vinnie Hager and the founders of Unlonely, still to air.)\n- Allocate more time and resources on making and using short clips from past and future ZEROPOD episodes for use on TikTok, Instagram and YT shorts (which are great content in and of themselves and also great drivers of listeners and subscribers back to the podcast.)\n- Double the total amount of funding from TNS initiatives and outside sources to at least 40 ETH. \n- Grow The Yellow Collective into the premiere nounish DAO (onchain club) on BASE as an accessible way for fans to discover nouns with the benefits of L2.  \n- Continue our mission of discovering and empowering nounish artists and creatives with the proceeds from daily auctions, running at least 20 contests for artists and creatives. \n- Update the Nouns community at minimum every 60 days with an onchain post on Propdates.wtf.\n\n# Budget and Requested Funding\n\nWe are requesting **130 ETH (~6 Nouns' worth at current FMV) for 6 months of operations** and our expected operational budgeting can be broken down as follows:\n\n-Art Contest Prizes: 2 ETH/mo\n-Social Accounts Management: 3 ETH/mo\n-Spaces Hosting (NOC + All Others, Approx 50/month): 4.5 ETH/mo\n-Podcast organization, interviews, editing, production, distribution, etc: 4.5ETH/mo\n-Other Video Content Production and Distribution (This Week in Nouns, educational content, nouns project highlights, etc.): 3 ETH/mo\n-Short content creation and distribution for TikTok, instagram, YT reels, etc.: 1.5 ETH/mo\n-General Administration (Event Scheduling, Interview Scheduling, Contest Coordination, Prize Distribution, etc): 3 ETH/mo\n\n**Total expected budget operational cost per month: 21.5 ETH = 130 ETH Total**\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Core Team:**\n-**[Toady Hawk:](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk)** Project management, strategy, Spaces hosting, podcast hosting, video ideation, production, editing & distribution, social media management, administration.\n-**[Robotfishgirl](https://twitter.com/RobotFishGirl)**: Spaces hosting, discord moderation, strategy\n-**[JackWyldes:](https://twitter.com/JackWyldes)** Video ideation, production, hosting, editing.\n-**[Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi)**: Prize distribution, discord admin, strategy.\n-**[Xargs:](https://twitter.com/mamaxargs)** Discord admin, general administration, scheduling, international outreach\n-**[Santhosh:](https://twitter.com/vellayan_0)** Scheduling, video editing, short video editing\n-**[Joshua Fisher](https://twitter.com/JoshuaFisher)**: Art Contest Coordination and administration\n-**[Symbiotech:](https://twitter.com/Symbiotech)** Social media management, Discord moderation, NOMO community\n\n**Other Contributors:** [Cardno](https://twitter.com/CardnoNFT), [BrettDrawsStuff](https://twitter.com/BrettDrawsStuff), [ProfWerder](https://twitter.com/ProfWerder), [Nikki](https://twitter.com/web3nikki), [JP](https://twitter.com/eusou_jp), [Davin](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye), [SuperTightWoody](https://twitter.com/SuperTightWoody), [Macki](https://twitter.com/_mackinac), [Satori](https://twitter.com/0xSatori).\n\nCore Team will collaborate to allocate funds to team members based on their contributions to the **weekly operations tasks budgets** outlined above.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Trusted 3/6 Multisig Members:**\nRobotfishgirl\nBenbodhi\nSupertightWoody\n[Maty.eth](https://twitter.com/matyETH)\nToady Hawk\n[Noun 142](https://twitter.com/noun142)\n\n\n\n---\n\n**We would like to thank Nouns for all of the opportunity and trust you have given TNS over the past 18 months, and we ask for your continued support here as we set out to do more with less and make an increasingly positive and tangible impact on the Nouniverse over the next 6 months.**\n\nIf you have any questions for us about the Proposal, please don't hesitate to pose a question here onchain, DM or post on X/Twitter or Farcaster @thenounsquare, or drop in our [TNS Discord](https://discord.gg/vh9TQbtR). \n\n**LFG! ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®**"},{"blockNumber":18627242,"blockHash":"0xbc5560d2eff79b51afb5e3cd89b95a305bf836d31d8cbd9731803847d7effbc7","transactionIndex":144,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x1d83b44c8bd3bc792099a511220e0438aef737778bc3adb7aeb3f1576528f1ac","eventName":"ProposalDescriptionUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalDescriptionUpdated(uint256,address,string,string)","id":446,"proposer":"0x31fD07Ec5BA9c1DE29A66dEfDa7804c21783177F","description":"# Bridging the Transparency and Accountability Gap Between Funded Projects and the Community\n\n# **TL;DR**\nEstablish a third-party service responsible for tracking, analyzing and overseeing funded proposals by communicating with builders, and provide proposal insights to the Nouns community through project archive website, monthly reports and Townhalls.\n\n# **Bridging the Gap**\n*Is this builder trustworthy? What is the progress of prop ‚ÄòX‚Äô? Why hasn't the prop ‚ÄòY‚Äô team shared the bi-weekly updates they promised? What difficulties are the developers of prop ‚ÄòZ‚Äô facing that require more time? How much return did prop ‚ÄúV‚Äù generate for the treasury?*\n\nThese are just some of the questions that often arise before and after the decision-making process in Nouns community. While we have funded numerous groundbreaking proposals since the DAO‚Äôs inception (such as Budweiser Super Bowl ad, the Rose Parade, Nouns E-sports) we‚Äôve also encountered projects trying to take advantage of the DAO and it‚Äôs funds as well as builders that raised concerns within the community by not communicating effectively during the development phase.\n\nEven though we have many Nounish data dashboards and tools, we‚Äôve realised that the tracking and evaluation process of funded proposals is not as efficient as it should. Additionally, solely relying on builders to submit reports voluntarily is not effective, leading to suboptimal results. What we lack is a bridge that fills the transparency gap between funded projects and the community.\n\nWe need to establish a set of proposal tracking and evaluation standards based on data, maintain regular communication with funded projects to encourage accountability throughout the community and have a place where all those info are available to everyone 24/7.\n\n![1](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJKfcxiVa.jpg)\n\n\n# **How?**\nWe‚Äôre proposing to establish ThePASS team (the team behind a prominent [DAO aggregator](https://thepass.to/) and [analytical](https://dune.com/thepass) platform) as an accountability third-party service to keep track of each funded project progress by:\n\n**[1]** analyzing the progress of funded proposals by creating a comprehensive evaluation and accountability system\n**[2]** regularly communicating with builders to ensure proposal progress\n**[3]** archiving project updates and compile them into monthly reports\n**[4]** hosting monthly Nounish Townhalls where builders, community and special guests discuss the progress of funded props\n\n![4](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkl7oejE6.png)\n\n\nThis approach offers several benefits such as:\n* Insights to the building process of funded projects\n* Solid data we can refer to in future decision-making\n* Recognition to the best builders\n* Attract new contributors and investors\n\n***We‚Äôre not aiming to be another proposal updates platform but the ‚Äúbridge‚Äù between builders and the community ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®***\n\n# **Execution**\n\n**[1] Evaluation system/Proposal Analysis**\n\nHaving a standard evaluation system ensures fairness and objectivity in the evaluation process as well as helps with accurate measurement, boosts transparency, and assists in making more informed decisions thanks to data.\n\nWe have established a ‚ÄòMeasurements Standard‚Äô with specific criteria based on project types. This standard will serve as the foundation for our proposal analysis, ensuring consistency and transparency in our assessments.\n\n![2](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJpYjliEp.jpg)\n\n\n*The tracking progress will initiate upon the successful funding of this proposal*\n\nOur team specialises in data aggregation and tracking so even if funded proposals number scales up, collecting and organizing those data will not be a problem.\n\nWe will keep track of on-chain data and social media updates (X, Discord, updates.wtf etc.) as well as engage in direct conversations with projects to provide you the most accurate metrics.\n\n**[2] Communicating with Builders**\n\nTo ensure everything is running smoothly, we will actively engage in group conversations with funded projects, starting from proposal execution to proposal delivery.\n\nThis will assist in:\n\n* Getting real-time updates directly from builders\n* Making sure proposal phases and goals are met\n* Identifying and reporting potential risks (delays, budget overruns, technical difficulties)\n\n**[3] Monthly Proposal Updates Website/Report**\n\nThePASS team will build a dedicated Nounish project archive website consisting of 2 seperate sections :\n1. ***Projects:*** Dedicated section to project updates coming directly from builders and our team‚Äôs data tracking efforts\n2. ***Monthly reports:*** Monthly proposal update reports section, ensuring easy access to the community\n\nAbout monthly reports, we will compile **[1]** Evaluation system/Proposal Analysis and **[2]** builder updates into an easy-to-read yet comprehensive monthly report, post it on the website and share it across different platforms such as X, Discord etc. to ensure maximum visibility.\n\nBy providing monthly reports to the community we aim to:\n* Bridge the ‚Äúupdates‚Äù gap between builders and the community\n* Enhance transparency and accountability within Nouns ecosystem\n* Boost builders reputation and project adoption\n* Have all current and past proposal updates info voters and the community needs in one place\n\n***Check our Treasury Report for ApeCoin DAO as a reference of our work: [Apecoin DAO Treasury Report](https://thepass.to/apedao/ape-dao-2023-may-treasury-report.pdf)***\n\n**[4] Monthly Townhalls**\n\nWe will host monthly Townhall meetings and invite funded projects, core members, DAO experts, and media observers to engage in open discussions about funded projects, address community feedback and talk about the overall health of the DAO.\n\nIn each Townhall we will invite at least 2 media observers as guests, 1 DAO expert, and builders featured in the last monthly report. As far as attendees, our goal is to have at least 50 in each Townhall.\n\n# Goals, Deliverables & Timelines\n**Goals**\n\nBy handling the proposal tracking and reporting tasks in an experienced team we solve the ‚Äòbuilders-community updates gap‚Äô Nouns DAO faces drastically and directly. Community will know where and when they are going to get their proposal updates as well as where to look for past funded proposals info and builders will have to provide those updates to maintain the community's support and trust.\n\nHosting monthly Townhalls will boost community engagement by enabling direct interaction with builders as well as highlight exceptional teams and individuals. On top of that by inviting special guests we make sure projects gain more exposure outside Nouns ecosystem which will help in attracting new builders and investors.\n\n**Deliverables (6 months)**\n* Nouns Proposal Reports archive website\n* 6x Monthly Proposal Reports\n* 6x Townhalls\n\n**Timelines**\n\n* Month 1: Commense website building, Monthly Report #1 , Townhall #1\n* Month 2: Website Building, Monthly Report #2 , Townhall #2\n* Month 3: Website Release, Monthly Report #3 , Townhall #3\n* Month 4: Monthly Report #4 , Townhall #6\n* Month 5: Monthly Report #5 , Townhall #6\n* Month 6: Monthly Report #6 , Townhall #6![3](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1kV0ljVa.jpg)\n\n\n# Funding\nWe are requesting 26 ETH in total for 6 months of operations.
