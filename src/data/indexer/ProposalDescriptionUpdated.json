I propose an initial investment of 312 ETH into the newly formed \"Nouns House DAO,\" which will be a rebranding of the current Enabler DAO. This investment aims to fortify and grow the entire Nouns ecosystem. This proposal also marks the INO (Initial NFT Offering) of Nouns House DAO.\n\n## üîç What is Enabler DAO?\n\nEnabler DAO is a Tokyo-based decentralized autonomous organization founded by Yuki Hamada, a serial tech entrepreneur and a former executive CPO of Mercari, a unicorn company in Japan. The organization specializes in developing property rental platforms using smart contracts and manages high-end properties in Tokyo, Hawaii, Kyoto, and Hokkaido. Given its successful real estate ventures and its profit-generating business model, Enabler DAO is at a pivotal stage, transitioning into tokenization. This evolution marks the birth of Enabler DAO as a key player in the blockchain and real estate space. Additionally, it is planning to introduce special benefits for NFT holders, such as the ability to rent available properties at discounted rates, leveraging its expertise and existing assets to foster new growth opportunities.\n\n## ‚ùì Why Approve This Proposal?\n- Nouns has transcended its origins as an art project and is now the foundation for various decentralized protocols.\n- We have already launched Nouns House DAO through NounsBuilder, which has undergone a third-party security audit and received community endorsement. The DAO's inaugural auction starts today.\n- I propose the allocation of 312 ETH, symbolizing my ownership of Nouns 312, to kickstart this initiative.\n- Recent case studies indicate that such ecosystem upgrades can drive substantial growth.\n\n## üó≥ Approval and Bidding Process:\n- **Approval:** Vote on the proposal.\n- **Bidding:** The auction will be held [here](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0x7F4Ec49a66D773D63092dbD8FbCDFC71C9D9e2f3).

In return, 1/20th of the founders' share will be allocated to nouns.eth, bringing economic benefits to the Nouns community.\n\n- **Treasury Allocation**: The 312 ETH will be transferred to the Nouns House DAO's treasury, to be utilized for various initiatives in a DAO-governed manner.\n\n- **Future Valuation**: In the 15 days leading up to approval, the next treasury could exceed the current average price of Nouns, indicating high future potential for the project.\n\n- **Momentum from 15-Day Window**: If approved within 15 days, the treasury price per NFT would increase by 20.8 ETH (312/15), adding momentum to Nouns House DAO.\n\n- **Setting a Good Precedent**: This approach could set a good precedent for future DAOs and projects, strengthening the decentralized ecosystem and serving as a model for how existing projects can evolve symbiotically.\n\n\n## üó≥ Approval and Bidding Process:\n- **Approval:** Vote on the proposal.\n- **Bidding:** The auction will be held [here](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0x7F4Ec49a66D773D63092dbD8FbCDFC71C9D9e2f3).

People involved in seemingly different fields, such as social contribution organizations and the web3 community, will gather together with the aim of creating new support and revenue methods that combine social problem solving and web3.\n\n- Simultaneously with the charity event, we will be hosting ‚ÄúNoggles Jack Nagoya‚Äù and the ‚Äúweb3 Community Exhibition,‚Äù expecting over 1,000 attendees. In line with the event, there will be talk sessions, Nouns' booths, workshops, promotional merchandise distributions, and planned social contribution activities.\n\n- Prior to the event, we will have a booth for Nouns at the Design Festa in Tokyo on Sunday, November 12, 2023. Following our previous Proposal 228 ‚ÄúNoggles Jack Tokyo,‚Äù this will be our second event where we will display and sell Nouns merchandise. Moreover, we will also be promoting ‚ÄúBright Any Colors with ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®.‚Äù\n\n## Background & Challenges\n- While individuals possess various facets, society often fails to accept them, because it's easier to manage by measuring everyone against a uniform set of values, leading to a tendency to avoid complexity.\nI believe that the biggest societal issue lies in the attempt to oversimplify intricate matters. Many people in today's society are bound by existing frameworks, having forgotten how to create new concepts and systems on their own accord.\n\n- The utilization of web3 technology for societal transformation is in an trial phase, but leveraging Nouns' autonomous decentralized system has the potential to assist.\nThere's a need for support towards technology that encourages ‚Äúpluralistic‚Äù decision-making and collaboration, as well as the activities that accompany it.\n\n- In October 2022, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities pointed out that Japan's education for persons with disabilities is lagging behind and made [recommendations.](https://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=6QkG1d%2FPPRiCAqhKb7yhsox6sZe%2Fik6d3iDJzISRPhvIaActFR9I%2FAIZ%2Be8dEYc3x9pGI%2BAqnUjiYnhf%2BzLRJLqW2mBzZdcaW0%2B10tvwrA97qOnmCuV89Qwl7dhkmc1B) However, there has been still no progress in understanding and awareness of disabilities, and the separation of special needs education from regular classes has been seen as a problem.\nFurthermore, research and studies on rare and congenital diseases are struggling due to the influence of market principles and an emphasis on efficiency.\n\n- ‚ÄúBright Any Colors‚Äù is aimed at supporting individuals with disabilities, children, and students. Participants will be able to exchange opinions within the event, increasing the potential for new ideas and solutions to emerge.\n\n## Theme & Objectives\n‚ÄúBright Any Colors with ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®‚Äù aims to enjoyably learn about DAOs through Nouns, aspiring to pave the way for a future where everyone shines their brightest. Our passion for enhancing the lives of all resonates with the public, and we've designed this event hoping that the concepts and systems of web3 naturally gain broader recognition. Relying on the insights and experiences from this endeavor, we will continuously engage in activities that leverage web3 technology to address societal challenges. We will host events 3-4 times a year, striving for widespread awareness and education.\n\n## Event Overview\n### Dec 23, 2023 Event & Workshop\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/2.png)\n\n- **A talk session will be held on the stage of the gymnasium.**\nOur special guests for this event will be Ms. Chizuru Azuma, an actor who has been actively involved in social contribution activities for over 30 years, and Mr. paji, a research expert in DAO and Co-Planner at pNouns.\nThe theme will be an explanation of the full-fledged DAO \"Nouns\" and its applicability to social issues.\n„ÄÄ\nFor example‚Ä¶the funding mechanism by Nouns DAO What is \"Treasury Wallet\"?\nWe'll introduce its structure, potential applications, and other real-life examples, all tailored for beginners.\nNouns-related images and videos will be projected using a projector into the visual stage production.\n\n- **Booth exhibition by social contribution organizations.**\nWe will introduce initiatives by organizations supporting people with disabilities, children, and students, as well as employment support facilities, as well as sell products and conduct educational activities.\n\n- **Invited event company \"NFT COLOR\" together the actively active web3 community in Japan Exhibiting NFT art works,** introducing the community, and interacting with social contribution organizations.\n\n### Event Proposal\n#### Various Workshops\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/3.png)\n\nMs. Chizuru Azuma is in charge of the planning, composition, casting, direction, costume design, and overall supervision of the [‚ÄúMAZEKOZE Island Tour,‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waK22pnvFRY) which is being streamed worldwide as one of the events of the ‚ÄúTokyo 2020 NIPPON Festival.‚Äù\n\n[Using the theatrical arts to create a more diverse society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8c-CycBt0M) | Chizuru Azuma | TEDxKyoto\n\n### Location\n#### Nagono Campus\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/4.png)\n[\"Nagono Campus\"](https://nagono-campus.jp/englishguide/) is located in Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture.\n\n### Phase\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/5.png)\n\n### Advatages of simultaneous event in Tokyo and Nagoya\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/6.png)\n\nAt the event \"Noggles Jack Tokyo\" held on May 20th and 21st, 2023, Nouns became widely known to the general public through Noggles.\nAt the charity event \"Bright Any Colors with ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®,\" we will set up a \"Noggles Jack Nagoya\" booth.\nJust like last time, attendees can enjoy Nouns characters and Noggles.

We want to create a database that helps anyone answer these questions, and an example website on top to support a first analysis: *What is the proposer pipeline and how can Nouns best support builders?*\n\nThe database will integrate activity across social channels and highlight which Nouns, advocates, and proposals have best supported the Noun‚Äôs meme propagation. Our data wrangling creative motto is: *Track Memes, Not (just) People.*\n\nAs a starting point, this work will gather the following data: [1] **onchain** activity (supported by the Nouns subgraph) and [2] two sources of social media (**Farcaster** and **Instagram**). This data will be available for others to query and use to investigate additional questions.\n\nWithin the scope of the work, we will also create a basic website including [3] a limited set of **general metrics** for context, and [4] **the first analysis website** focusing on the specific challenge of understanding the proposal conversion process. In this way, we will be the first ‚Äúapp analysis‚Äù built on the dataset.\n\n## Background\n\nAs of the moment, the Nouns‚Äô community and audience members produce a wide variety of data. Over time, more data is likely to migrate onchain (e.g. similar to vote comments today) and data will be produced across even more digital localities. The *United World of Nouns* will have a wide-ranging data footprint. Combining data across these localities can become a powerful tool for proposal development and decision-making.\n\nHowever, as @Krel mentioned in their [Request for Proposers](https://www.notion.so/94dadff999ac493b9902aa002e4b296e?pvs=21):\n\n> *‚ÄúNouns DAO does not have a reliable way to measure ‚Äògrowth‚Äô or ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô. Its not clear what should be measured, or what growth in the context of Nouns even means.‚Äù*\n> \n\nThis project will create an initial repository of activity growth combining onchain and offchain data. We are long overdue to experiment on this front!\n\n## Scope Overview\n\nThe Noun Pulse has two components: \n\n- [A] the open database and\n- [B] a single-purpose website with general metrics and a first analysis\n\nIn addition, we will include an analysis report explaining current trends, issues, and opportunities in the proposer pipeline.\n\nTo begin, we will include onchain data available in the Nouns Subgraph and two social media channels: Farcaster and Instagram. We will then publish a selection of core metrics that provide clarity to Noun holders and the wider community.\n\nMost importantly, the underlying data pool (Meme Activity Database) will serve a step towards a data-driven Nouns culture, which community members and potential builders can use to find opportunities for proposal submissions. This should enable builders to bypass building a new database. Instead, we can amend it, expand it, or fork it. As a result, we can focus our energy on answering new business questions.\n\nSuccess of this project will be measured based on **data pool connections** (e.g. external usage of the Meme Activity Database), **web usage** (unique visitors), and **discussions** or proposals that successfully reference the data.\n\nThis work will enable future analysis to include key derivative NFT projects (Gnars, LilNouns, cc0-lib) and other dominant social spaces (Discord, Discourse, X, Lens, etc).\n\n## Product Components\n\n![Components (1).png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkelSB-7p.png)\n\n### Meme Activity Database (a.k.a. The MAD)\n\nWe‚Äôve named the database the ‚ÄúMeme Activity Database.‚Äù The reason is that we don‚Äôt want to just track people; we want to track *********************************the content*********************************. Our ambition is that this database is an MVP aggregation of all-things Nouns, reliable **meme-data-as-a-service,** such that we can service a variety of new data-powered projects.\n\nAs mentioned, this database will be open source and free access: anyone should be able to contribute to it (e.g. add a new source or table) and build on top of that.\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to facilitate the use of data across the Nouns ecosystem. As the cc0 library enables media usage, the activity database enables tracking and impact analysis.\n\nThe Web API interface will be available publicly  distributed per specific sources (onchain Nouns, Farcaster, and others) as well as in aggregated form to enable the development of tools such as alerts, bots, and analytics dashboards.\n\nData will be synchronized in real-time directly from the Nouns‚Äô Subgraph, Farcaster, Instagram to an SQL database. The sync mechanism will be architected in a uniform adapter interface for easier future integration with other onchain data and offchain sources, such as Twitter, Discourse, Discord, Telegram, DeSo, and Lens.\n\n## The Noun Pulse Website: General Metrics\n\nWe believe that many Noun community members have a variety of needs. We will supply an overview of general metrics to serve as a source of truth for conversations.\n\nThese include:\n\n**Example Onchain Metrics, Supporting Clarity on Arbitrage**\n\n- Treasury\n- Treasury Usage Rate (Monthly Spend)\n- Burn Value\n- Estimated Burn Value at Next Fork\n- Average Auction Price\n- Current Arbitrage Opportunity (3-day average auction price minus value at next fork)\n- Count of Unique Holders\n- Count of Active Holders (Unique Holders with Vote w/ Reason in past 30 days)\n\n**Example Proposer Pipeline Metrics, Supporting Clarity in Builder Ecosystem**\n\n- Proposer Pipeline (with addresses and available contact information, details in next section)\n- Conversion Rates from Stage to Stage\n- Excerpts of Builder Stories\n- Count of Prop House Submissions\n- Count and % of Prop House Submissions from New Builders\n- Count and % of Passes Prop House Submissions\n- Count of Candidates\n- Count and % of Candidates from New Builders\n- Count and % of Candidates converting to Onchain Proposals\n- Count of Proposals\n- Count and % of Proposals from New Builders\n- Count and % of Passed Proposals\n- Count of Unique Proposers\n- Count of Unique Funded Builders\n- Growth in Onchain Comments\n    - Growth in Candidate Feedback\n    - Growth in Prop Vote with Reason\n    - Growth in Prop Updates\n\n**Example Offchain Metrics, Supporting Clarity in Nouns Reach**\n\n- Number of Posts\n- Total Engagement (Likes+Comments+Shares)\n- Engagement Rate (Ratio of Engagement to Posts)\n- Most Engaged Content\n- Total Followers\n- Total Followers with Onchain Identity\n- Follower Growth Rate (Updated based on API opportunity)\n\n***Representative Image of General Metrics***\n\nThe design for the website will use assets from the cc0 library and default Noun design parameters from the main website noun.wtf\n\n![Screenshot 2023-11-02 at 16.52.43.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyTCrHWm6.png)\n\n## Alpha Analysis Report: The Proposer Pipeline\n\nThe first iteration of the database will be focused to help address a key opportunity in the Nouns DAO: **attracting, shepherding, and retaining quality builders**. The data we select and analyze will be guided by this problem statement.\n\n### **Analysis Context and Design**\n\nEvery DAO has a funnel of builder activity. In the case of Nouns, we can roughly organize the participation process as:\n\n![Proposer Journey Graphic (1).png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H10ZHHWQT.png)\n\n1. Aware (Saw Nouns)\n2. Curious (Engaged with Nouns, Offchain)\n3. Audience (Engaged with Nouns, Onchain)\n4. Voter (Vote with Reason)\n5. Prop House Submitter (Submitted to the Garden)\n6. Prop House Funded (Proposal Passed)\n7. Candidate (Submitted Candidate Proposal)\n8. Onchain Proposer (Submitted Onchain Proposal)\n9. Funded Builder (Proposal Passed)\n10. Committed Builder (Completed Proposal)\n11. Multi-Proposal Builder (Multiple Proposals Passed)\n\n---\n\nHowever, we currently don‚Äôt have clarity on the people involved throughout this proposal process, or where Nouns can focus on to coach builders and retain them. \n\nAs Noun40 describes in this proposal‚Äôs feedback, there are many open questions. \n\nSome of ours include:\n\n- How many of the candidate props are from net new ppl?\n- Of the net new ppl, do their candidate props grow to be full props that pass (success cases)\n- How did those prop builders find us? (number will be so small you could just ask them)\n    - *Note: We will document stories where data is not available*\n- What is the number of ppl that commented on the candidate proposal?\n- Is that quantity and participant of candidate feedback growing?\n- Are prop house builders in the garden round then submitting candidate proposals? If not, why?\n- Are builders returning to submit new proposals? If not, why?\n\nAt the end of the day, ***‚Äúwe want more net new quality prop builders and we want them to have success and a low drop off rate.‚Äù (Noun40)***\n\nOur team would add: **we want those quality builders to come back.**\n\n---\n\nUsing this framework as a starting point, we can analyze the data, create different visuals, and validate the journey hypothesis. We understand this may not be trivial and some data or identity mapping may not be available. Data will be complimented with builder stories.\n\n![Screenshot 2023-11-02 at 16.50.42.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJFvSrbXT.png)\n\n### **Analysis Considerations**\n\nAs part of the deliverable, we will also include documented business rules underlying the analysis. For example, we will include what means if a builder is net-new. This is not necessarily trivial since we want to avoid counting an ethereum address as ‚Äúnet-new‚Äù if it‚Äôs the same builder but submitting an application with a new ethereum address.\n\nEach of these business rules will be discussed openly throughout the work to ensure the Noun community has opportunity to provide feedback.\n\n### **Analysis Outputs: A Written Report**\n\nCreating graphs and metrics is not enough for action. As a result, the scope of the analysis will include a **written report (In Notion or similar)** with recommendations. \n\nThe intention is to test out the usefulness of the database and the website ‚Äî to build for action. In this case, we will understand where the proposer pipeline issues are, support them with data, and provide tangible advice. \n\nFor example, insights may include ways to identify potential builders earlier, and help them find a Noun-sponsor prior to a candidate proposal submission; imagine if another group of Nouns community members (not just holders), offered to shepherd builders in the proposal process, similar to gardeners. \n\nThese insights will be framed as RFPs (**Request for Proposals**), such that the Nouns community has clearer direction on where to invest to strengthen the proposer pipeline.\n\n## Product Roadmap\n\nThe execution of this project will be done in an iterative fashion. By building in public and getting ongoing feedback, we can deliver what the community needs, and data that will support Nouns decisions.\n\n**Iterative Phases:**\n\n- **Phase 1:** Deliver alpha analysis plan outline and approach. Deliver mock-up UI for web application. Deliver database raw data components and MVP. Host open Q&A with Nouns (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 2:** Deliver basic UI w/ metrics. Deliver initial list of insights from analysis. Provide update on database. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 3:** Deliver UI updates. Deliver builder stories. Provide demo of database queries. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 4:** Complete UI polishing and metrics calibration. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to celebrate launch and discuss future analytics (where next?).\n\n## An Ambitious Vision\n\nThis project aims to uncover what ‚ÄúNouns-Native‚Äù analytics could look like, and what data infrastructure is necessary to feed this analytics into the broader Nouns governance and participation process.\n\nWe‚Äôre certain there will be other innovations along the way. After all, we need to address challenges in crossing the web3-to-web2 data pipeline chasm. Is it possible? We think so.\n\nFortunately, the team is not alone. They have a wide array of connections with governance leaders across the DAO space: Optimism, Purple, Forefront, Radworks, SeedClub, FWB, Cabin, and others.\n\nNouns is a place for ambitious ideas, and we are an ambitious team.\n\n## Team\n\nThis project will be led and executed by Rafa Fernandez (Farcaster: @rafa) and Rafi Gutkowski (Farcaster: @rafi). \n\n- Rafa Fernandez is a community architect with a focus on building [Digital Public Utilities](https://www.notion.so/General-Networks-e4615b9b52294f8bab34a82b47023d11?pvs=21). He has decade of experience in corporate analytics and studied materials-science and engineering. He is the founder of Folklore (Folklore.Institute), a community that curates and commissions research on digital cultures. Most recently, he was part of the Summer of Protocols research program looking at [online swarms](https://www.notion.so/41c114211ac045f087c44c16bd993748?pvs=21). Previous to the program he worked at Mirror where he worked in creator partnerships and community development.\n- Rafi Gutkowski is a software engineer and data scientist ([libred.org](https://libred.org/), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/rgutkowski)). He is building [Farway](http://farway.org), a Farcaster meta-client for social analytics. He started mining bitcoin in 2015 but only after exiting from his recent startup, did he double down on web3. Since then Rafi has been working on sementic analysis of decentralized social graphs, as well as creating web3-web2 bridges, such as Folklore‚Äôs web3-signature to feed [broadcast applet](https://www.notion.so/Folklore-5d34757913064064b87119c4593eda74?pvs=21).\n\n## Funding\n\nWe are a stream of 22.5 ETH to fund this project over 10 weeks.\n\nThe funds will be allocated to a two-person team (Rafa and Rafi). They are split roughly 25-75 between planning and iterative engineering. There is about a 40-40-10 between data engineering, analysis + visuals, and handoff. There is approximately 10% reserved for bugs and issue resolution.\n\nWe expect that once the initial traunch of data engineering and visuals is complete, then we can make a decision on what the community needs more of (if anything), such as expanded data, or expanded analysis\n\n## Our Commitments\n\n- We commit to posting updates on¬†[updates.wtf](https://updates.wtf/)¬†with sprint plan and outcomes, in alignment with each of the community Q&A feedback sessions.\n- We commit to cancelling the stream based on community feedback.\n- We commit to executing this work as an open-source project, such that other onchain communities and organizations can benefit.\n\n## Other Notes\n\nThis proposal was built based on the Basic Nouns Proposal Template, built by Rafa and available here: https://hackmd.io/@rafathebuilder/BkPAmHZbp\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to learn more about this proposal, the first Q&A conversation on Aburra is available here: https://youtu.be/_dr2yZulMGU"},{"blockNumber":18502645,"blockHash":"0x333358dc41c96677a1765b9ccc67c7a11c2365ba7dfbb4b33d24c768187bbef3","transactionIndex":121,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x8145fa149fd43e03751870c36f67b99fb481c4eea0fc9a7ce34a368355081b8b","eventName":"ProposalDescriptionUpdated","eventSignature":"ProposalDescriptionUpdated(uint256,address,string,string)","id":430,"proposer":"0x7c1282a7621F0e2f6169E151628552A8B8a57B2d","description":"# CC0 Nouns Themed Playground + Build : Spread Nouns Design And Ideology Worldwide Through Fun And Play\n\n### **[UPDATE]**\nThis is a version 2 of [[Prop 408: First IRL Nouns Themed Playground]](https://nouns.wtf/vote/408) where we have input more details based on feedback received.\n\nAlso to show our resolve, we've worked on the detailed design and have it build out as well.

Create a large scale tangible Nounish **Public Good**.\n2. To attract a **new subgroup** of creatives & audience to Nouns.\n3. To achieve **self-sustaining long term** proliferation globally via the distribution and adoption of cc0 Nouns themed play-structures design.\n\n![A3Dgxek.png](https://i.imgur.com/A3Dgxek.png)\n\n**As a builder in Nouns:**\n1. To inspire community members to **leverage their networks** and create impactful proposals.\n2. Become an **enabler for Nouns community** to ease interactions with both well-established brands and non-crypto organizations.\n3. Showcase the **versatility** of Nouns' cc0 assets.\n\n**Strategy (Focus on long-term continuity):**\n- Use this Nouns Themed Playground as a monument that compliment the open-source design kit.  \n    - Showcase the design and instill trust in its playability.\n    - Distribute open-source design to at least 10 industry professionals and **incorporate** our Nouns themed play-structures **in their product catalogs**\n    - Expand Nouns network value and **boost adoption** of Nouns themed play-structures.\n    - Scale Nouns themed play-structures organically\n- Submit this Nouns Themed Playground project to architecture platform like [ArcDaily](https://www.archdaily.com/); to **gain attention from new audience** into Nouns.\n*(we are already in contact with ArcDaily CN curator)*\n    - Open-source design kit will be uploaded but not limited to: github, cco-library, platform like Arcdaily, Bimstore, etc.\n    - Allowing anyone who can build it in their region to plug and build easily.\n- Apart from a **high quality documentary** to tell our story, we will also leverage on media partners.\n    - Sharing BTS footage as short format videos, to **rally attention,** **enhance curiosity**, bringing fans along on this journey, as we show progression and erect our first Nouns Themed Playground.\n        - Content will be shared on but not limited to: X, Farcaster, IG, Tiktok, Youtube, Little Red Book, etc.\n        - New fans are also able to ask questions about Nouns along this journey.\n    - Prop progression will also be shared and updated timely on [Propdates.wtf](https://www.propdates.wtf/)\n\n## **Nouns Themed Play-Structures**\nOn top of the initial batch of play-structures, we will also identify **additional 4 Nouns characters** with the design team. These will also be created into play structures and release as part of our open-source design kit, to provide a more **diverse range** of play options which would help boost adoption.    \n\nBelow are the initial batch of play-structure design:\n![PvesMIo.png](https://i.imgur.com/PvesMIo.png)\n![fixz9u4.png](https://i.imgur.com/fixz9u4.png)\n![YkWRXSB.png](https://i.imgur.com/YkWRXSB.png)\n![djZZ0Ad.png](https://i.imgur.com/djZZ0Ad.png)\n\n![iUgJbGz.png](https://i.imgur.com/iUgJbGz.png)\n![gkAgf1V.png](https://i.imgur.com/gkAgf1V.png)\n\n![plrxaMQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/plrxaMQ.png)\n\n![nnoE35D.png](https://i.imgur.com/nnoE35D.png)\n![1ntFyVf.png](https://i.imgur.com/1ntFyVf.png)\n![Z0XcwVm.png](https://i.imgur.com/Z0XcwVm.png)\n![TOfLCiK.png](https://i.imgur.com/TOfLCiK.png)\n![6B1HsP6.png](https://i.imgur.com/6B1HsP6.png)\n![FAesqnE.png](https://i.imgur.com/FAesqnE.png)\n\n\n### **Site Visual**\n![pPKg3fq.png](https://i.imgur.com/pPKg3fq.png)\n![RyDHDCm.png](https://i.imgur.com/RyDHDCm.png)\n\n## **FAQ:**\n**1. Is this playground open to public?**\nYes! This will be a public playground that is accessible to everyone; a large scale tangible Nounish public good.\n\n**2. Is the land for the themed playground secured?**\nYes! We have secured a 2000sqm plot of land beside Element 6 to construct this themed playground.\n\n**3. What is Element 6?**\nElement 6, located in Guangzhou, is a recreational hub with a diverse range of indoor and outdoor activities, include but not limited to go-karting, rock climbing, surf simulator and more; drawing an average monthly footfall of 800,000 visitors. It operates as a subsidiary under the XiangNeng Investment conglomerate.\n\n*Click on the image below to watch their introduction.*\n[![804iyWZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/804iyWZ.png)](https://youtu.be/IlRq1ZJtYPA)\n**4. Are there any liability concerns?**\nLiabilities are covered under Element 6's insurance that enveloped both indoor and outdoor activities.\n\n**5. Will we encounter any permit issues?**\nElement 6 owns the land and it is commercially zoned, where the proposed construction work aligns with zoning regulations. We've also conducted due diligence, including consulting with the authorities, and received verbal approval thus, we are confidence in obtaining the final official approval in a timely manner.\n\n**6. Can this prop be done in phases?**\nProgressing in phases to protect the DAO's interest is an ideal approach; however, the land allocation offered to us isn't available in perpetual for gradual proposals process. Therefore, we've structured the funding in a manner that allow us to commit to this project with an initial release, while the rest is released via stream as we progress, which the DAO can halt if any unforeseen issues arise.\n\n**7. Why not just fund the design of the play-structures?**\nFunding open-source product is Nounish; however, it's wasteful without utilization, and its impact is diminished in the absence of (in this case) tangible play-structure to showcase actual playability and potential. The physical Nouns Themed Playground would help facilitate the propagation of such reusable components to other location & industry professionals with greater effectiveness.\n\n**8. How is this prop scalable?**\nPlayground equipment had a market share of $4.91 billion in 2022, with a projected increase to $9.65 billion by 2030, reflecting a 7% CAGR from 2023 to 2030. This highlights a linear growth in this market.\n\nThe physical Nouns themed playground would allow us to showcase and build trust with industry professionals, allowing us to share our open-source designs with them, to have them integrate Nouns themed play-structures into their product catalogs confidently. We are able to promote open-source while at the same time allowing us to **leverage on their clientele and this growing market, boosting adoption** of Nouns themed play-structures in playgrounds worldwide, given the preference for catalog-based designs by most clients.\n\n\nFurthermore, anyone, especially builders in Nouns community can also use this activation as a monument to ease interaction with their local town that do not have playground or intent to build a playground, to eventually plug and build a Nouns Themed Playground using the open-source design.\n \n## **Budget**\n\n**[UPDATE]**\n*We've secured a new contractor for the design and fabrication of our Nouns themed play-structure, reducing cost by 12%.*\n\n### **Allocation**\nThe total proposed budget is **594,850 USD** for 6mths duration, with an allocation as follows:\n\n**1. Construction: 522,850 USDC**\n* Immediate release: **200,000 USDC**\n* Remaining via *Stream 1*: **80,712.5 x 4 = 322,850 USDC**\n     \n**2. Team Compensation: 72,000 USDC**\n* Immediate release: **24,000 USDC**\n* Remaining via *Stream 2/3*: **(6,000 x 2pax) x 4 = 48,000 USDC**\n   \n**Total Immediate release: 224,000 USDC**\n**Total Stream over 4mths: 370,850 USDC**\n\n*Stream start 1st Jan'24 - End 30th Apr'24*\n![LLUSxWp.png](https://i.imgur.com/LLUSxWp.png)\n### **Breakdown**\n![Hq53eOk.png](https://i.imgur.com/Hq53eOk.png)\n### **Timeline**\n![lvDlVh4.png](https://i.imgur.com/lvDlVh4.png)\n\n## **Who we are!**\nFor Nouns community who do not know who we are, allow us to introduce ourselves.\n\n![JSehkp9.gif](https://i.imgur.com/JSehkp9.gif)\n\nWe are [Karl (Nouncil)](https://twitter.com/WideEyeKarI) and [Nic (Noun74)](https://twitter.com/noun_74) & we've been active with Nouns since Jul 2022.\nWe have:\n\n- brought Nouns presence into China with IRL activation at [Shanghai](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1640922970330738688), [Beijing](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1663381928278409218), [ChengDu](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1672628395300257793) as well as [Singapore](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg/status/1567474695536283650)\n- created [\"Nogge chair\"](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1641044874358304768) which is at Himalayas Art Museum as a public infrastructure\n- release free to collect Nouns digital collectables with [Shina Weibo](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1648670544404025344)\n- organized [art contest](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1658012368063062016) allowing more Chinese artist to get exposure to Nouns\n- assisted local cafe in Beijing in putting up a [Nouns mural](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1667187943709245440)\n- onboarded local animator to create a [short shorts for Nouns](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1681867478887202817) (releasing soon)\n- facilitated the [inclusion of Nouns into a web3 introduction book](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1675778263678070787) which is available at bookstores throughout China\n- onboarded award winning music producer Hanjin Tan, who will be debuting \"Noggle Chair\" in his [musical theatre show in HongKong](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1719904562239471814)\n- created a [Nouns statue serving as a public good infrastructure (signage)](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1708330846275682776) at Mount Liupian, Guangzhou\n- worked on various IRL charitable public good activations, including [nounifying a local autism school](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg/status/1585995683168821248), [Nounish Holiday Season](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg/status/1606688371119915008)\n- kick started green initiative public good activation in the form of [beach clean up](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg/status/1559183156887990273) which spark a [clean up contest by TNS](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1560882911100174336) that eventually started [Nouns Africa](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye/status/1562433784922148864)\n- assisted byWassies in creating our very [first Nouns themed hotel room](https://twitter.com/WideEyeKarI/status/1632224927763042305)\n\nBeyond our involvement in Web 3, both of us possess over a decade experience in project management. We have conducted thorough due diligence to ensure the **full feasibility** of our proposal.
