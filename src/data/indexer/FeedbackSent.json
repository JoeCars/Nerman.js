Appreciate the signal and congratulations on your prop getting approved!\n\nAllow us to address some points:\n\n1. The partnership with Element 6 is secured. But because this is a prime location in the CBD with an avg footfall of 800K, they do have other development plans queued for this plot of land if this prop do not fall through. We are very thankful as we were given a grace period because they understood we have to undergo a proposal/voting phase. \n\n2. The mockup exist to serve as a visualization on how we can infuse Nouns element into a playground setting paired with the discussion on construction feasibility with Element 6's appointed design team and contractor. We are really happy that there are so many other builders like yourself who share the same enthusiasm as we do, to want to showcase Nouns in the best possible ways. Each creative to his own, we believe in our vision and that Element 6' team have what it takes to create our ideal Nouns Themed Playground. We also think that having more creatives from various industry sector exposed to Nouns cc0 assets is an overall positive gain to the DAO. \n\n3. There're synergy between a public themed playground and Element 6's recreational hub. A public open-to-all themed playground holds the potential to significantly increase foot traffic to an area that is already bustling with human activity. The influx of visitors would enhance the overall imagery and prosperity of that area.

First, I agree that this should not be the standard. We do not want to have to pay ETH every time a Noun is distributed. Verbs are not a standard case. They are defacto employed by Nouns, so any notion of gifting does not apply. They invented and engineered a novel fork mechanism—that is not typical. They might be an N of 1 case as of right now.\n2. I believe we fundamentally want Verbs to be Nouners, with all of the value and voice that comes with it. As mentioned in the prop, they have created exceptional amounts of value for Nouns across the board with their protocol upgrades. \n3. We should not assume that contributors now or in the future are in a financial position to take on the tax burden themselves for receiving a Noun. Having a need to sell the Noun somewhat defeats the purpose of the distribution.\n4. You cannot escape FMV with novel transaction construction. The tax burden exists no matter what possible claims, redemptions, vesting, or other smart contract methods exist.\n5. The precedent this *is* setting is that you need to contribute over long periods of time with objectively valuable output. The DAO then needs to vote and agree that this is the case in a prop to grant Nouns (and tax coverage). This is a *very high bar*. \n6.

In fact, it's quite the opposite; this represents the worst-case scenario in the proposal. Let me explain:\n\nWhen we initially conceived this project three months ago, we calculated the expenses for production, development, and marketing to introduce the watches to the public and make them available for sale. Our conclusion was that if the DAO funded the production and marketing costs, while we would manage the sales, it wouldn't make sense for the DAO to sponsor it. Moreover, there would be no risk on our part if the watches didn't sell.\n\nSo, we explored a second option: we'd request sponsorship for production, marketing, and labor expenses and commit to returning the funds to the DAO. However, a problem arises with the payment process—how would the DAO receive the funds back? We considered creating an NFT, where people would need to purchase the NFT, and the funds would go directly to the DAO. The downside of this approach is that it would exclude non-crypto native buyers. Additionally, if we didn't sell all the watches, we'd face another situation with no risk on our part.\n\nThis led us to the third option we decided to pursue. We're asking for the budget required to cover Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) production, labor, and shipping costs. In return, we plan to allocate some of these watches for marketing purposes, essentially using watches as part of the marketing budget instead of money. However, the decision about who should receive these watches remains open. While we could make that choice ourselves, we prefer to have the DAO make that decision. We will handle the physical distribution; simply tell us where in the world to ship them.\n\nWe have some influencers and YouTubers who are eager to review the watches. The DAO can choose to sponsor the project, and we will distribute the watches to the right individuals. This is an ongoing effort from our side. As an example, here's a review of a product from my brand on a YouTube channel with 2 million subscribers, and the video garnered 21,000 views: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMpK8jDv9I8&t=42s  \n\nOur goal is to create a watch to sell, not to be distributed within the DAO. The distribution aspect serves as a marketing strategy. We are building a cc0 watch brand, with the intention of working on it for the long term. However, we cannot invest our own money in production if we do not have ownership of the brand; this exposes us to the risk of working for nothing. Nevertheless, we are convinced that we are working for a just and worthy cause.\n\nIf the project is funded, we will initiate pre-sales through our website, which is already online. We will accept various forms of payment, including crypto and fiat. If we manage to exceed the MOQ in pre-sales, we will produce more watches using our own budget. We will continue to promote the brand and generate sales. We will also produce more watches based on demand.\n\nWe will build the first cc0 watch brand!"},{"blockNumber":18428031,"blockHash":"0x5fd0684da94f9a37198899b4b800c877131d0f02deb0199035f2f9f1443f91b3","transactionIndex":272,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0xc87872e05d4144398b4f7bfb4b06acf6ad75c508d8dd6a1cd0dd5c323829003b","eventName":"FeedbackSent","eventSignature":"FeedbackSent(address,uint256,uint8,string)","msgSender":"0xF952A0788137Cef8Cba0B315a042262Ddc12c3aF","proposalId":414,"support":2,"supportChoice":"ABSTAIN","reason":"Hi Nouns,\n\nI’ve allowed some time to pass to allow the proposal voting to conclude and process the feedback provided.  Thank you to everyone who voted and shared your thoughts on our proposal!  \nOur conviction on this project remains as strong as ever, and we are confident that we’re the right team to deliver a unique, exciting, and addicting Nouns indie game.  \n\nAfter reviewing the feedback, I fell short on selling this game and focused too heavily on surface level game design, as well as the prospect of investing in an indie game.  We are working on a revised proposal to address the common themes that came up in the feedback.  This update will focus on communicating a clear vision emphasizing the following areas:\n\n•\tOne Noun, Every Day – This core mechanic serves as both our game’s “hook” and a bridge to Nouns culture.  We believe this is both a perfect fit for a Nouns rogue-lite and establishing a social and dynamic game culture.  Our update will provide a deeper dive into how we plan to leverage this mechanic in other elements of our game’s design, as well as the social engagement and competition that rogue-lite enthusiasts seek out.  \n\n•\tCreative Direction – Our art assets included in this proposal are early concept designs, and we’re in the process of refining them to incorporate your feedback provided.  We have an exceptionally talented art team and hope to gain your vote of confidence to capture the vibrant Nounish personality.  Additionally, we’d like to stick to the decision to keep the lore generally “lightweight” and leveraging the Forgotten Souls as the minions and antagonist; however, we can do better at defining the narrative and ensuring a cohesive collaboration between the two worlds.  \n\n•\tGameplay – Committing to a genre and play style was difficult, but we decided on a rogue-lite bullet hell after considering the scope of work, replay-ability, scalability, and our team’s interest and experiences.  Our demo is in a very nascent state, and we’ve already received a lot of positive feedback on the gameplay.  Additionally, we have developed our systems in-engine to build on top of it.  We’re confident that capturing the Nounish identity and “following the fun” will lead to great results.  We have noted the constructive feedback provided and will explore these opportunities as we revise our proposal.\n\nAgain, thank you all who took the time to vote and provide feedback.  As we work to make these revisions, I’ll be active in the Nouns community and hope to engage with you all directly.  We’re looking forward to making the adjustments needed to gain your support!\n\nSumiez"},{"blockNumber":18428784,"blockHash":"0xfb0908b992f258ca5c2c37bd725738599ff77a0bbaeffc9033678199b6e98004","transactionIndex":75,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0xde3d79a3e5cbee095a7a024e18de0cea0a8e85471d751b771a1b703a05b2d919","eventName":"FeedbackSent","eventSignature":"FeedbackSent(address,uint256,uint8,string)","msgSender":"0x1db19B9903c5510AA5a866ea643Eb021CD12Bda0","proposalId":421,"support":0,"supportChoice":"AGAINST","reason":"agree w/krel."},{"blockNumber":18430246,"blockHash":"0x4727084061107b2ce9c3f84e8a98ffdb9340beb909968ecce9940fb76a4596c0","transactionIndex":110,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0x0e063987afc327a036340c14e2cbf3f79928b1d4c79c4cef3c2f995a9678b99f","eventName":"FeedbackSent","eventSignature":"FeedbackSent(address,uint256,uint8,string)","msgSender":"0x32d1A53f6709a03f4b6cf4cb0501204ba188d4f5","proposalId":422,"support":1,"supportChoice":"FOR","reason":"has potential to be, by far,  the most important prop in nouns history . merit szn get into it"},{"blockNumber":18431036,"blockHash":"0xa737573838078e0e28a8cc49c1f1df31f0f7dd68247b30e6be019b9e899b7cdd","transactionIndex":128,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0x9ab85246ed27a81d7073b90aac3f98e97f0e51bf1d17a871951c00c4af3cdd27","eventName":"FeedbackSent","eventSignature":"FeedbackSent(address,uint256,uint8,string)","msgSender":"0x2D71bAB150528fC4d8549b5A2F3e860d75d17296","proposalId":423,"support":1,"supportChoice":"FOR","reason":"It is an honor to be your sponsor.

I can just eyeball the nouns farcaster channel size to have a sense of that. a really detailed look here would require a lot of attention to dig up all the onchain artifacts that matter. okay, we had these 5 open edition mints from the dao. these are all the addresses that minted that (there's cost to minting and you needed to know about it at a given point in time so there's a baseline sybil resistance). okay, these addresses that submitted props to prop house rounds (these actually WON which is also basically sybil resistant). these are voters and onchain prop builders (the highest signal of quality). now if you layer on the social graph of farcaster (follows) then you have a social attestation graph between an existing set of wallets that already have these rich set of onchain clues as to whether they are real humans and whether they are real fans. you could also do certain types of pagerank like algorithms that would help weight addresses that are connected to other addresses that have existing high signal. you could cluster connected addresses as well to see if there is a cluster of not well connected bot like activity that is circular. you could do all of that to help us understand the growth of real nouns fans. maybe you could have a scoring system that delineates casual fans and hard core fans and the deep infinite players. this second direction alone also to do well would likely require your full attention and is a COMPLETELY different problem with a different value prop for the dao than the figuring out the prop builder success pipeline.\n\nin the current form of the prop I would vote against. I'm not interested in surface level stats and someone spending time integrating a bunch of surface level stats into a dashboard and merging them with arbitrary weights to make a score that goes up or down on a graph.\n\nhowever i would LOVE someone to really deeply tackle either of the two problems expressed above. and I'm really hopeful this team could tackle one of them deeply!"},{"blockNumber":18482531,"blockHash":"0x81ca8e846a2d40d291c61be55fc68af33bb6e47966553b88a7f6139d0b1e8d77","transactionIndex":64,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0xd6c30ef19028e7a846259511f8473a3ca7c1773d5a86eae81df7ceb9a8002090","eventName":"FeedbackSent","eventSignature":"FeedbackSent(address,uint256,uint8,string)","msgSender":"0x9c74aE08Fd4337E14786f086D911E964df35e623","proposalId":428,"support":1,"supportChoice":"FOR","reason":"Sasquatch was there since day 01 and drove some of nouns’ most successful proposals with esports, bringing a lot of visibility to nouns, and building an interesting case study for decentralised sponsorship"},{"blockNumber":18483300,"blockHash":"0x800e52e03ef5306d5364b9f43541b37d13ab73e12487111aaacdd75320eb37ec","transactionIndex":156,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0x7898b68c4d9bf45492f8de4fa80995c6b193691e7822cd71e6e9dc74347d1995","eventName":"FeedbackSent","eventSignature":"FeedbackSent(address,uint256,uint8,string)","msgSender":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","proposalId":426,"support":1,"supportChoice":"FOR","reason":"I absolutely love this!

We have all seen and continue to experience the challenges when it comes to putting Nouns funded products in the web3 communities and general public hands. With the whisky, this is a long-term project and monthly sales are not important right now as we’re still building the foundation for the product narrative and focusing on building https://www.nouns.africa that will become the focal point for all the products that I bring to market in South Africa and import. In retrospect, I think that if we had launched the whisky sales right after the prop was passed we would have at least sold 20 barrels to the Nouns community based on the messages I have in my inbox. A lot of the people who showed interest either haven’t replied to my messages or replied that they don’t have the funds anymore. I also think that more Nouns holders should support this project as it will show confidence to the broader web3 community. We also haven’t started with our broader marketing campaign that will not solely focus on blockchain-funded whisky anymore but the entire Nouns product offering on https://www.nouns.africa, it makes more sense to do things this way and be patient with the process.\n\nWith that being said regardless of the watch’s funding cost, this is a very important high-end offering that not only fits into the global fashion category but allows collectors to be a part of something that has a limited first run, which is valuable, think vintage/retro watch drops. These types of products need to sit on a shelf / vault. The watches are something that people in South Africa will be interested in as we’re a very fashion-focused + and conscious continent with Instagram and Twitter pushing personal brand development hourly year in, year out. In my opinion, something to think about is how the Supreme brand has positioned itself and how they’ve created a lifestyle that can be showcased + auctioned at Sothebys: https://www.sothebys.com/en/series/the-supreme-vault-1998-2018 If you have to look at these props: Danit 3D Fashion - 26 / 41 / 251, Nouns Brand Apparel - 109, Noggles - 56 / 123, Nouns Vision - 57 & the latest Nouns Watch concept - 416. In theory, you could showcase a very forward-thinking and cutting-edge Nouns collection that I think would surprise a lot of collectors. \n\nIf you have to look at my role within the Nouns ecosystem in a traditional sense: I’m the importer of Nouns products to Africa and act as the marketing manager with the goal of placing Nouns products in front of the general public, even if they don’t know what a nft is, own crypto or understand DAO funding. It is the brand identity that is most important here in Africa. With Public Good Beer being manufactured globally, there is another opportunity to produce it down the line in South Africa. What I’ve come to understand is that people need something tangible to engage with when seeing a new brand for the first time. When we did our soft launch in May at the South African Whisky Fest, we handed out a lot of caps, mugs, pins, and whisky-aged coffee. The public was excited to be a part of this process when I explained that these are the first batch of products to be produced for Nouns in South Africa and you’re the first people to represent the brand. This type of excitement doesn’t really exist in South Africa as big brands like Nike, Adidas, Puma, Reebok dominate the product and fashion categories. So once again I urge the Nouns Voters to pass this prop and keep in mind that the product-related builders in the global community can use these items to create a narrative that Nouns DAO continues to be at the forefront of blockchain-funded fashion and collectibles.\n\nI still believe that it will take 3 more summers to properly establish the Nouns physical and consumable products as a household brand. To fast-track this process in South Africa we’re in negotiations to align withhttps://www.cottonfest.co.za for the next 3 years by sponsoring the fest with Nouns Coffee and in 2027 Nouns Whisky. They are currently working with Budweiser (there is a big opportunity here as a relationship already exists in America), Coke Studio, Count Pushkin Vodka, Red Bull, Puma, and others. So Coffee and Whisky can fit in here and potentially a run of Public Good Beer in the future. Having Noggles, cool Caps, T-Shirts, potentially watches, and other collectibles at a festival activation will be way cooler than Vodka or Coke branded items. \n\nI will be submitting a Nouns Coffee proposal for discussion in the next few days to start this journey while our whisky matures. In the meantime take a look at https://www.nouns.africa, it is a work in progress and I want to launch in December.

First off, I wanted to thank you all again granting our team the opportunity to build our vision this Nouns indie rogue-lite game.  Now, for a quick summary for what we’ve focused on the first two weeks:\n\nTeam Kick-Off: \nWe had our formal team kick-off meeting after the week of Thanksgiving (even though only 3 of 5 of us are in the US, haha).  Our core team will consist of 2 game devs, 2 artists/animators, and myself as the game designer and project manager.  \n\nStrategy:  \nWe’ll be splitting production into 4 separate sprints, each being around 3 - 4 weeks in total.  We’ve organized our sprints by priority and have just broke ground on Sprint I.  Sprint I will focus on developing the necessary Systems in Godot 4 to build all content with.  We’ll design the systems for the Player Character, Abilities, Weapons, Upgrades, and World.  Due to the nature of the project, these systems will all be modular to provide for as much creative flexibility when we get to developing and testing content.  Additionally, we’ll be making big game design decisions to establish the game flow and how each feature will interact with each other! \n\nArt Direction: \nFirst thing first,  we’re designing the standard Nouns character to use as the template for all Nouns characters to follow.  We will fine tune the art style to make sure that it’s scalable (since we’ll have a whole lot more characters to come); dynamic (as the combination of traits will drive each characters playstyle; and of course, as fun as possible.  This style will remain consistent between the player character, enemy minions and bosses, and the environment.  The later 3 areas will be focuses of a subsequent sprint, but we do plan on exploring early concepts for our first boss and some biomes that will exist in the environment.\n\nMarketing:  \nOur marketing goal will be to build a grass roots following as a true indie development team.  We’ll make some big decisions this month such as the game title and branding, then put together a social media marketing strategy to provide a regular pipeline of engaging content, from behind the scene looks, our design process, game engine development, and most importantly, spreading the meme.  \n\nAdvisor:  \nWe have one more exciting announcement to make!  We have brought on Dan Fessler as an advisor to our team.  Dan’s has a wealth of creative and technical experience in the gaming industry.  He was most recently the Chief Creative Officer at Manticore games working on a 3D user-generated content gaming platform.  Today, he’s a founder at Incite developing AI-powered games.  I’ve personally known him since I was a kid, so excited to have him on our team to provide another great perspective to our already talented team. \n\nWe’ll be back in two weeks with another Propdate, but please feel free to swing by our Discord channel or DM me directly if you have any specific questions!\n\nRegards,\n\nSumiez"},{"blockNumber":18736862,"blockHash":"0xa13e8a3e962836cb5046449881b23dcf70452dc717c4efff9373bf4f0195a223","transactionIndex":46,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0x9e65d1f9aeae5dc9d50020f5d4d9ce0e84d0d719830134caea107777d796991e","eventName":"FeedbackSent","eventSignature":"FeedbackSent(address,uint256,uint8,string)","msgSender":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","proposalId":457,"support":0,"supportChoice":"AGAINST","reason":"$145k and a Noun for something that I think substracts value from the DAO (onchain DAO votes for someone to swap a Noun are inefficient in ETH and attention, it also is just picking off the treasury and reducing scarcity)"},{"blockNumber":18739241,"blockHash":"0xaeb8532120b189aeb72154ddfcfd065a3cad49f0b6e0443ebe1a076b89db6245","transactionIndex":157,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0xead05c06d5d946e7f8354af5ac6d96755924d32080814934fd5c885fd730383b","eventName":"FeedbackSent","eventSignature":"FeedbackSent(address,uint256,uint8,string)","msgSender":"0x32d1A53f6709a03f4b6cf4cb0501204ba188d4f5","proposalId":457,"support":2,"supportChoice":"ABSTAIN","reason":"not sure why i bother with these hopeless dissents lol but here it is anyway/  responding here to majority objections on other props since i agree about flooding governance but i think not about criticisms of the permissionless version. \n\nthe main thing the swap accomplishes is it enables community minting initiatives to continue to thrive which has high cultural/curatorial upside. its also a way for scout winners to select a noun they love rather than be possibly forced to sell to a market maker and buy back at a premium. if we want to onboard aggressively (as i think we should) via prop house this seems important. maybe the erc20 coupon is a compromise there. \n\n as a recent buyer of nouns, i have generally resisted the urge to mint in advance of fomo/tns in hopes that personal aesthetic preferences could be expressed alternatively through this approach. probably ends today after seeing initial feedback.  \nto add to this tension there is also a converse incentive to mint/buy a less personal noun since it is easier to treat coldly as pure governance + exit rights. BUT, anecdotally, there are a couple nouns in treasury that i would immediately move to the hodl wallet & even voluntarily burn all v3-enabled exit value thereupon if such a mech existed.\n\n less fetishization over auction may also be constructive for the dao overall, since every auction \n would become, fungibly, a forever noun auction for all participants. as one's identity evolves or dreams up new creative objectives etc i think its interesting to keep friction low.\ngenerally doubt we will see a uniform race for 'lowest ids', particularly if a (dao-programmable) cutoff id is established. Non-dysphoric nouners are nouners that are less likely to sell or ultimately even fork, and if some value heads and others id#, cohesiveness or funkiness, there is a bit of everything to go around. The scarcity games are not priority imo and at any rate they don't stop with this tooling. the swap game is itself, interesting, fun, and deep. \n\nfinally, i find it fascinating if nouns were to bounce around and become colored by a plurality of different custodial energy - makes the onchain stories we are telling more chaotic, lively and new."},{"blockNumber":18747475,"blockHash":"0xca2e7dc2d1cc7ec5455cd5d716ebbc7346569d0ae30cfccce6228b052fb5c5bd","transactionIndex":35,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0x80f2bb7e2b5494e9036731998d70d0c1ad5b3f54cdcd38b48ef60fcca397f7b7","eventName":"FeedbackSent","eventSignature":"FeedbackSent(address,uint256,uint8,string)","msgSender":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","proposalId":453,"support":2,"supportChoice":"ABSTAIN","reason":"Im also for giving wizardo the wizard noun, but pushing against (this iteration of) this generic way of doing it.\n\nIf wizardo submitted the same txs but with other words, i would vote For."},{"blockNumber":18769686,"blockHash":"0xc0b7bbb464cb3bdefc92ade757ff9b5cfe30fd01d0a3526e43ae5af8593c2ef7","transactionIndex":188,"address":"0xf790A5f59678dd733fb3De93493A91f472ca1365","transactionHash":"0x7358ed29c039a6bf03ea54f7c5f70fa61d5eae3f0759142b2c8fa7e0932ab1bf","eventName":"FeedbackSent","eventSignature":"FeedbackSent(address,uint256,uint8,string)","msgSender":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","proposalId":457,"support":2,"supportChoice":"ABSTAIN","reason":"Im keen to have more good teams build on nouns, but i struggle a little bit with the format here.\n\n> Our goal was to gauge community interest, and ensure there was product market fit before continuing to pursue a better implementation (v2).\n\nGiven there was only 2 swaps, and the community pushed against both, did you really find PMF?

We have gotten a ton of positive feedback on X/Twitter and Farcaster, and there seems to be a large appetite from the community for a swapping mechanism. As such, I would argue there is product market fit for a swapping mechanism, and we are trying to achieve that by having this proposal address all the feedback thus far. Even tho the initial 2 props failed, I would say that the MVP is not a failure, rather a stepping stone to bringing NounSwap to fruition.\n\n### To nounounounoun.eth:\nWe understand your general opposition to a swapping mechanism. But, people effectively swap Nouns everyday by selling and buying, or via OTC swap, trying to get their forever Noun. In fact, I suspect many of the active members in the Noun’s community have swapped in some way shape or form. NounSwap will facilitate this process, making it easier, more accessible, and remove the friction, while also earning revenue for the DAO. \n\nWith respect to the redemption token pushback, Noun Scout, and governance proposals are frequently giving away Nouns. Why not give the recipient the ability to pick the Noun that best resonates with them rather than picking for them? The DAO will have full control over these tokens and how they are distributed.\n\nWith respect to subjective value. We were thinking that the group of Nouns excluded from permissionless swaps would be lower N, and also specific ID’s. These parameters will all be DAO settable. For Nouns in the exclusion group, a governance proposal with personal message and custom fee can be attempted for a swap (v1 mechanism). As such, for the excluded group, we don’t need to try to create a ranking system, if they are desired they will be evaluated on a case by case via a governance proposal. I would still argue that the nouns which can be permissionlessly swapped for are non-fungable. The swappers decision to exchange their Noun, coupled with the added fee reflects a subjective valuation, they value the treasury Noun they want to obtain more than the Noun they own. \n\nIn terms of the funding ask, we think our overall proposal is quite fair for the design, and engineering efforts required. I am seeing a general tread of the Nouns community based on recent successful proposals of valuing core development work less than that of art or community based projects. If this is truly the case, developers looking to forward the Noun’s protocol are going to be hesitant to contribute.\n\n### To thebower.eth\nWe totally understand the proposal spam, and voter fatigue. We are proposing to implement v1 fully as the prop based solution as it will be leveraged as part of the v2 implementation for Nouns which are excluded for permissionless swaps. For anyone really itching to swap before v2 is released, they can use this mechanism with a personal messages, and a fee included in the props. v2 should significantly alleviate the issue with the introduction of permissionless swaps.\n\nIn terms of retro funding, unfortunately we are not in a position to work for 3 months for free, and hope that the community will retro fund this entire project. Generally, we try to avoid retro funding, and believe that builders should be paid at least based on milestones for the work they do that brings value to the community. \n\nIn terms of funding ask, we think our proposal is quite fair, refer to my last comment to nounounounoun.eth. In terms of usage so far see my comment to krel.eth.\n\n### To screenshotessays.eth:\nThe initial props were from the MVP, and we acknowledge it was not perfect, and to be quite honest we were not fully expecting the first props to pass. V1 implementation outlined in this proposal is based on all the feedback we got from those initial swap props + Twitter/X + Farcaster. The foundation we built so far will be used for v1, and v2 parts of this project.\n\nIn terms of subjectivity and value of Nouns, see my comments to nounounounoun.eth.\n\n### noun12.eth\nThe end goal here is to move to a permissionless implementation (v2), that won’t need a governance proposal, and votes. Please read NounSwap v2 section of this proposal. Furthermore, all swap fees will be going to the DAO treasury, and NounSwap allows Noun owners to get the Noun that resonates with them most, increasing the overall satisfaction within the Noun community.

We respectfully ask any delegates associated with these wallets to share their feedback on the project and proposal with us, either on-chain or through a private channel. Your feedback will be invaluable to help us determine a path forward for NounSwap. \n\nDespite the setback, the experience of developing the NounSwap MVP was enjoyable, and we remain optimistic about finding a way forward.
