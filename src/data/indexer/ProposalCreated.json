Early on, it appeared to me that these 32*32 characters would make great voxel models and could potentially be turned into 3D avatars for the metaverse. I kept making those models and posting them on Twitter as animated GIFs.\\n## What Is It?\\nSimilar to the Nouns playground, we would like to build a web app to let users create and download custom 3D Nouns. Users could pick attributes or leave the drop down to random (default value).\\n\\nThink of the « build your character » screen at the beginning of a game. You compose your Noun, and can test a few animations on your build, like \"walk\", \"run\", or \"dance\". Once you are done, there is a download button that outputs a textured and rigged GLTF file.\\n\\nThis extends the ecosystem beyond 2D into the 3D world and allows for animations, games, renders and more to be built using those prefabs. It opens a world of possibilities for the nouns ecosystem and will result in more derivatives and more memes over time.\\n## Project Ethos\\nThe project will be open sourced under GNU GPLv3 and all the 3D art will be available to download and use via the interface. We will share the code on Github once the project is completed. Our goal is to encourage artists and engineers to build on top of this and extend the Noun ecosystem.\\n## Scope of the Project\\nIn order to complete a working version of that site, we need:\\n1. All project assets modeled in 3D:\\n* 236 heads\\n* 30 bodies\\n* 136 accessories\\n* 19 glasses\\n+ Additional assets for the lower body (following existing colors):\\n* Approx. 30 pants\\n* Approx. 30 shoes\\n2. All assets rigged and animations clips preloaded into the GLTF models\\n3. A React + Three.JS (using react-three-fiber) interface that allows us to:\\nLoad all 3D files and texture in a database\\nCreate a front end with drop down menus for each of the six attributes + a 3D viewer in a viewport + 3-4 buttons to autoplay animations (idle, walk, run, dance).\\nBuild a random function to compose 3D nouns as the default drop down.\\nClick a download button to get your rigged and textured 3D noun, ready to be imported in a game engine or 3D editing software (GLTF, OBJ, VOX etc)\\nWe currently have a WIP proof of concept at [https://nouns.vercel.app](https://nouns.vercel.app). We bought [www.voxelnouns.com](www.voxelnouns.com) and [www.3Dnouns.com](www.3Dnouns.com). We also bought voxelnouns.eth and 3Dnouns.eth and will transfer them to the DAO on launch.\\n## Who Is Building This?\\n* CoralOrca - [https://twitter.com/coralorca](https://twitter.com/coralorca)\\n* OxFloyd - [https://twitter.com/0xFloyd](https://twitter.com/0xFloyd)\\n## Compensation\\nA total of 32 ETH to be transferred to the address below in one full payment:\\n* 28 ETH for V1 of the site as detailed in the scope of the project section\\n* 4 ETH for 1 year of maintenance including hosting, domain name, SSL certificate, cross-browser compatibility testing, mobile/desktop testing, back-ups, librairies/software upgrades. Also setting metric tools for checking website performance page load speed, responsiveness, stability, etc. If necessary, scaling for increased site traffic.\\n\\n**0x9c74aE08Fd4337E14786f086D911E964df35e623**\\n\\nSubsequent years of maintenance and future improvements/features to come in separate proposals. For future improvements, see the list below.\\n## What Could Be Built on Top of 3D Nouns?\\n* Allow users to walk/run/jump and control their noun in a 3D world using the keyboard or touch screen on their mobile device.\\n* Allow users to download AR files (USDZ file).\\n* Allow users to upload their 3D nouns design following the voxel template and organize a competition where the best nouns are selected. This would require user accounts.\\n* Option to mint your own 3D noun."},{"blockNumber":13141978,"blockHash":"0xf50174e2bde4b07ecb75857e70db13abad5aaa5af2d3b624b2414c0052bcd0d1","transactionIndex":237,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xe71991fa2f6c3f282a61d1e90465058c9ee5627dcdfa7a9c7ec8a3c8b181d77d","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":3,"proposer":"0x912A526852527dfB5D44c22a15B708AA493cDa6B","targets":["0x912A526852527dfB5D44c22a15B708AA493cDa6B","0xA340828B995016437351890D6b98AeC698E2ef74","0xbFc80468Df050D2a73fE455d6b3e484caF00E12f","0x73F843d1668E36a2952F2e505879Fac9ABbf3dB4"],"signatures":["","","",""],"calldatas":["0x","0x","0x","0x"],"startBlock":13155118,"endBlock":13174828,"description":"# Nouns Party\n\nNouns party is an effort aimed at making community-driven nouns bidding easier, more interactive, and more likely to win than today's strategies. \n\n## Links\n[Proposal Document](https://www.notion.so/Nouns-Party-020ce483fef64391831eb69d3e71fa74)\n\n## Scope\nThe new [nouns.party](http://nouns.party) will include a completely updated design and several innovations which should dramatically simplify group bidding while increasing the odds of success. This will transition [nouns.party](http://nouns.party) from a simple fork to a pool-driven bidding application for nouns. This will require new contracts, a new application, and a new design. \n\nThe following functionality will be included labeled by versions. V0 will be guaranteed to launch for the completion of this proposal. V1 items will be built as time permits within the 4-week scope. \n\n- **[V0]** Party contributions will be deposited in a \"vault\" style contract which carries forward from one noun auction to the next. These contributions will be withdraw-able at any time outside of an active winning bid. If they are not withdrawn, they **will automatically accumulate for the next noun auction.**\n- **[V0]** Nouns won through these contributions will be automatically fractionalized for the winners. Contributors can then claim the shares of their winning noun. If multiple nouns are won, they can claim all shares at once.\n- **[V0]** Real-time whale bidding viewer, to help inform the party. The UI will display any pending bids.\n    - **[V1]** We will also show the estimated remaining Ethereum for the top bidder.\n- **[V0]** Manual group bid submission when sufficient Ethereum is gathered.\n    - **[V1]** Auto-bidder mechanism to avoid bidding confusion and democratize gas fees\n- **[V0]** Currently nouns purchased through party bid must pay an upfront 5% Eth fee for each party noun. This fee is used for the ongoing maintenance and development of partybid. We propose the same fee, but instead of a \"pre-auction\" fee, we will introduce a post-auction fractionalization 5% token supply fee awarded to the nouns party multi-sig. This fee will apply to any nouns won through nouns party.\n- **[V0]** Social Cursors with a noun-y style\n    - **[V1]** If cursors become a UI burden, we will explore avenues to remove that burden\n    - **[V1]** We will explore a social platformer-type game\n\n## Contributors & Compensation\n\nWe ask that the nounsdao fund the design & development of this project. Additionally, we plan to introduce a 5%  per \"party noun\" win post-fractionalization fee (matching the existing fees of the party bid mechanic). This fee will be allocated to the [nouns.party](http://nouns.party) multi-sig.\n\n\n### Design and Development funding - Ξ96\n\n**Role:** Project lead & Software Engineer (Node+Go+Front-end, Solidity contract review)\n**Compensation:** Ξ48 (Ξ32 + Ξ16 escrow for contributor compensation)\n**Handle:** @devloper_eth (aka noun#13)\n**Wallet:** 0x912A526852527dfB5D44c22a15B708AA493cDa6B\n\n**Role:** Sr. Software Engineer (Solidity)\n**Compensation:** Ξ32\n**Handle:** hans_klaus#0998 on discord (aka noun#13 colleague) \n**Wallet:** 0xA340828B995016437351890D6b98AeC698E2ef74  \n\n**Role:** Front-end Engineer\n**Compensation:** Ξ8 (50% at proposal vote), Ξ8 (50% dispatched from escrow upon completion)\n**Handle:** @0xFloyd\n**Wallet:** 0xbFc80468Df050D2a73fE455d6b3e484caF00E12f  \n\n\n**Role:** UX/UI designer\n**Compensation:** Ξ8 (50% at proposal vote), Ξ8 (50% dispatched from escrow upon completion)\n**Handle:** @bstsrvdbld\n**Wallet:** 0x73F843d1668E36a2952F2e505879Fac9ABbf3dB4\n\n\n## Future Direction\nWhile we believe that nouns party is the highest impact work we can do today, we also believe there are many other exciting nouns' related behaviors that can be improved.  Those include predicting the next noun, announcing pending bids, and clarifying fractional governance. We also believe there are social aspects, such a \"register an e-mail to be notified\", which can open up additional nouns opportunities in the future.\n\nWe are excited to explore more opportunities in this direction."},{"blockNumber":13153747,"blockHash":"0xf1ddaaa76db128b469975527481fe0f4f7cc402d7953c6c4797d4d744b135223","transactionIndex":16,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xe18f59c5066bed6902db562d3671899bf83a740c27c1d932882288397f3834a5","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":4,"proposer":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","targets":["0xC5a975AF88AF5712ec3659dd6f6CD3ae4689f9f5"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":13166887,"endBlock":13186597,"description":"# Verbs Prop #1: NOUN O'CLOCK AUTOMATION APP\\n\\n## IDEA: NOUN O'CLOCK AUTOMATION APP\\n\\nWe spoke with @4156#9052 and love his ideas of *Noun'o'clock* as an Internet cultural moment.

The project entails creating two 4 metre (12 foot) high bronze sculptures that will stand side by side in a major international city. One sculpture shall be of Nouns and the other will be of Noir.\\n\\n### What is it?\\n\\n#### Art\\nThe Nouns sculpture will be based on one Noun. The selection process of the Noun could be contentious and the process will need to be established, or at the least explored, in advance of any funding. The process needs to be collectively agreed on by the Nouns.\\n\\nNoir's sculpture will be an iconic 'Super Classic Head' of the kind Noir originated on the Berlin Wall in the 1980s. Noir’s early physical world avatars clandestinely painted on the Wall were a form of political activism through art and represented the people of Berlin at the time.\\n\\nThe NOUNS x NOIR sculptures are intended to be harmonious. Equal in height and overall proportions. Yet a juxtaposition will be apparent between the pixelated Noun and the more rounded analogue Noir. The sculptures are intended to be original works of original art and are not statues.  \\n  \\n#### Method\\nBoth sculptures will be cast at the largest fine art bronze foundry in Europe and either traditionally patinated or painted. A suitable permanent and prominent public location will be secured in a major international city and the sculptures will be installed together in dialogue.\\n\\nThe entire process of creation at the foundry through to installation shall be documented through film (ground and drone), photography and timelapse. Each stage of traditional bronze casting shall be captured.\\n\\nThe story of the project shall be told.\\n\\nThe resulting documentary will attract an audience drawn from both the native crypto world and the art world and propagate a crossover between the two worlds.\\n\\n### Scope of the Project\\n#### Project management and fabricators\\nThierry Noir and his studio team will oversee the day to day management of the project.\\n\\nThe proposed bronze foundry is Pangolin Editions ([https://pangolin-editions.com](https://pangolin-editions.com)). Pangolin Editions is one of the foremost fine art bronze foundries in the world and extremely highly regarded.\\n\\nFor transportation and public installation, MTEC are proposed ([https://www.mtecfreightgroup.com](https://www.mtecfreightgroup.com)). MTEC specialise in the installation of public sculptures internationally.\\n\\nBoth organisations have already been engaged about the project and have provided quotations for the work.\\n\\n#### Public location\\nTo justify the effort and expense of the project, the intention is to situate the NOUNS x NOIR sculptures at a permanent location in a major international city such as New York, London, Paris, Seoul or Tokyo.\\n\\nA major public area within the selected city is also essential to the legacy of the project. A public park or square will be the desired location. This will allow the sculptures to become an iconic landmark within the city and also serve as a meeting point.\\n\\nSuch a location will also facilitate the greatest number of people as possible to enjoy them, provide an aesthetically pleasing and iconic backdrop and create high culture impact internationally.\\n\\nThe ideal is to locate the sculptures on municipal land and not privately owned land. This chimes with the themes of freedom within the art of both Nouns and Noir.\\n\\nA 99 year lease (based on a standard form public art precedent) of the sculptures will be granted to the location.\\n\\n#### Past Discussions\\n[Initial discussion on Nouns DIscord](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-x-noir-proposal/87)\\n[Further discussion on Nouns DAO Discourse](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/884419393864495114/884513517535912026)\\n\\nThis project is phase specific with further advancement based upon the success of the preceding phase as decided by the Nouns DAO.\\n\\n  \\n\\n## Phase 1: Design and Scouting\\n\\nThis proposal relates to the first design and scouting phase of the project.\\n\\n#### Objectives:\\n- Originate the forms of each sculpture.\\n- Decide which Noun the Nouns sculpture shall be based on or to design the process for selecting the Noun.\\n- Scout for locations for the sculptures.\\n\\n#### Timescale:\\n- A timeline of 3 months is anticipated in order to achieve the above objectives.\\n\\n  \\n\\n### Progression to Phase 2: Fabrication and Installation\\n\\nShould the outcome of the design process be deemed unsuccessful from a collaborative, aesthetic or other standpoint the project will likely not progress to Phase 2.\\n\\nShould locations for the sculptures not be forthcoming then the project will likely not progress to Phase 2. If a location should then present itself in the future the option will remain to resume the project, such a decision will be subject to NounsDAO decision making.\\n\\nAn initial outline draft of Phase 2 is below. This draft document provides and overview of the bronze casting process and detail around the public installation of the sculptures. A budget based on official quotes from suppliers is also laid out.\\n\\n[Phase 2: Fabrication and Installation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q8ZomF3u5WzWsQtWeg_QCW0KbOlAG5VAiI0dshLAF0E/edit#)\\n\\n### Compensation\\nThe artist is not seeking any compensation for his work on this project, will dedicate over a year of studio time to both phases of the project and is donating all project management resources. The artist can also add extra funding if needed.\\n\\nFollowing an invitation from the Nouns, the NOUNS x NOIR project is envisioned as a collaboration. It is therefore fitting that both sides should provide resources to the project.\\n\\nThe hope is that the project will be regarded as an important art historical crossover between two distinct artistic movements. Purely from an artistic standpoint, the prospect to work on an important public art project such as this is compensation alone.\\n\\nThe nature and spirit of Noir’s artworks originated on the Berlin Wall has since resulted in a largely self funded public art practice outside any top down commissioning processes. This project is being approached in a similar fashion.\\n\\n### Budget\\nSome hard costs arise do arise out of this phase of the project to a total of Ξ5\\n\\n- (i) sculpting and CAD design at the bronze foundry Ξ2;\\n- (ii) CNC milling and 3D printing of maquettes Ξ1;\\n- (iii) initial structural engineering work Ξ1; and\\n- (iv) travel provision for international site visits Ξ1.\\n\\n#### Funding Schedule\\n\\nΞ5 payable at the onset of the project.\\n  \\n### Who is building this:\\n\\nThierry Noir is a French artist based in Berlin. You can read more about him here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Noir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Noir)  \\n\\nThierry Noir will manage the project in collaboration with the Nouns. Thierry Noir has assembled an in-house team highly experienced in delivering international public art projects, including monumental bronze public sculptures, from inception to completion."},{"blockNumber":13290416,"blockHash":"0xc2fc7c74169e1c199ea23766f31cbc02aabf880531f9ea456627510a621ab2c0","transactionIndex":200,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xee87c52bf1c5fc3d707cdac1b2761a46d90e8747bd821ea4ddcb62012f06831b","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":8,"proposer":"0xAe7f458667f1B30746354aBC3157907d9F6FD15E","targets":["0x286cD2FF7Ad1337BaA783C345080e5Af9bBa0b6e","0xBa5A9D43d0A6b7C00cFa18538eF1B8F5163b1E77","0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2","0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2","0xCD18eAa163733Da39c232722cBC4E8940b1D8888","0xCD18eAa163733Da39c232722cBC4E8940b1D8888"],"signatures":["","","deposit()","approve(address,uint256)","createStream(address,uint256,address,uint256,uint256)","createStream(address,uint256,address,uint256,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x","0x","0x","0x000000000000000000000000cd18eaa163733da39c232722cbc4e8940b1d88880000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000015af1d78b58ee6200","0x000000000000000000000000286cd2ff7ad1337baa783c345080e5af9bba0b6e000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000c249fdd327812e00000000000000000000000000c02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006168c4800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000061a56980","0x000000000000000000000000ba5a9d43d0a6b7c00cfa18538ef1b8f5163b1e7700000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000098a7d9b8316d3400000000000000000000000000c02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006168c4800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000061a56980"],"startBlock":13303556,"endBlock":13323266,"description":"# FOMO Nouns\\n\\n## What Is It?\\n\\nWe propose a tool that allows the Nouns community to vote on and mint the most appealing Nouns for each auction in real time.\\n\\nAs background, Nouns are psuedo-randomly generated for each auction based on the block when the prior auction is settled. Each block generates a unique Noun, and recent auctions have been settled on a random block when either the auction winner wants to receive their Noun or a random user wants to start the next auction.\\n\\nWe believe the Noun community can benefit from more deliberating selecting the next Noun for a number of reasons:\\n - More appealing Nouns build the appeal of the Nouns art\\n - More appealing Nouns have generally garnered higher bids in recent auctions. This helps build the Nouns treasury and influence.\\n - Voting enables wider community participation in the Nouns project even for users who don't hold and are unlikely to win a Noun\\n - The voting and settlement setup provides even more excitement around Noun O'Clock\\n\\nWe propose building a website that will allow community members to vote on whether to settle in a given block and mint a particular Noun, and if sufficient votes are received, immediately settle the auction in the same block to mint the desired Noun.\\n\\n\\n### Origin of the Project\\n\\nThis idea grew out of Shark DAO's interest in forcing a Shark to be minted for the DAO to acquire. After some discussion, we realized the whole Nouns community may have preferences on what Nouns to mint, and we could set this up as a platform for the community to voice their preferred attributes for the benefit of the broader Nouns ecosystem.\\n\\nThe builders:\\n|   [@_forager](https://twitter.com/_forager)   |     [@0xrayo](https://twitter.com/0xRayo)     |\\n|:---------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|\\n| ![](https://i.imgur.com/Qr903QF.jpg =200x200) | ![](https://i.imgur.com/HCfkVnO.jpg =200x200) |\\n\\n\\n## Project Details\\n\\nThe website will allow users to see the Noun mintable in every block (approximately every 15 seconds). It will also contain relevant information and analytics (e.g. available settlement funds, whether any attributes would be the first minted).\\n\\nIn a short window after each block appears, users will be able to vote on whether the new Noun is attractive enough to mint. Voting may be binary (i.e. yes/no) or score based (i.e. 0-10), and it will require a threshold that adjusts based on the number of active users. MetaMask sign-in will be required to prevent vote spamming.\\n\\nAll features will aim to be fun, social, and interface. Ideas include voting via emoji (🤢 to 🥰), social cursor interactions (ala PartyBid), a real-time vote progress bar, and/or POAP awards for some-or-all participants during voting.\\n\\n### Early Mock-up\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VSM5otQ.png =50%x50%)\\n\\nVotes will be tallied in real-time on the backend. If a sufficient number of votes are received, settlement will be instantly initiated. Settlement must occur in the same-block, so Flashbots will be used to speed inclusion. This will require a contract to provide miner tips and ensure the settlement transaction is not mined in later blocks.\\n\\nA contract will be also be built to store community donations and fund settlement costs.\\n\\n\\n## Project Deliverables\\n\\nThe project will encompass the following deliverables and support for 1 year.\\n\\n * **Development**\\n     * Frontend:\\n         * Instant display of mintable Nouns\\n         * Metamask integration\\n         * Voting mechanism\\n         * Social integration for chat, emojis, other fun mechanics\\n         * Relevant Noun analytics & history\\n     * Backend:\\n         * Aggregate and store user votes\\n         * Calculate and store relevant Noun analytics\\n         * Secure kick-off of auction settlement\\n     * Contract:\\n         * Accept community donations to fund settlement\\n         * Pay for instant block inclusion (via Flashbots)\\n         * Ensure late block inclusion is prevented\\n     * E2E Speed:\\n         * Settlement must occur **extremely** rapidly to ensure inclusion requiring tuning and optimizing each component\\n * **Infrastructure & Deployment** (1 year)\\n     * Frontend:\\n         * Domain name registration\\n         * Website hosting & SSL\\n         * Alchemy/Infura monitoring integration\\n     * Backend:\\n         * Redis (or other storage) hosting\\n         * Settlement infrastructure\\n         * Alchemy/Infura settlement integration\\n     * Contract:\\n         * Contract deployment\\n         * Settlement contract tests\\n\\n## Project Funding\\n\\nWe propose funding of **50 ETH** to help support the deliverables above. This will be split:\\n - 28 ETH to [@_forager](https://twitter.com/_forager) for settlement backend, contract for donations and Flashbots payment, on-chain Nouns monitoring and analytics components\\n - 22 ETH to [@0xrayo](https://twitter.com/0xRayo) for the front end, back end, and analytics\\n\\nStart-up deployment and infrastructure costs will be covered under development costs. The website and infrastructure will be supported for a minimum of 1 year. Support after that period will fall under a seperate proposal and/or be left for community support.\\n\\nSettlement costs will not be included in this proposal. Normal settlement costs ~0.05 ETH, and fast inclusion may require additional payment for higher gas or Flashbots miner tips. Community donations will be solicited to support this expense.\\n\\n\\n## Miscellanea\\n\\n### Project Ethos\\nThe project code will be open sourced under GNU GPLv3 with all code shared on GitHub upon project completion. Our goal is to help the Nouns community build the best roster of Nouns possible, promote the Nouns project, and maximally expand the Nouns treasury by driving higher bids on attractive Nouns.\\n\\n### Limitations and Risks\\nNoun auction settlement can be performed by any user. While recent auctions have taken ~10 blocks (and community may accept longer), it's possible for a competing tool or mischevious user to settle the auction immediately or on an undesirable Noun. However, this is possible even without this project, and we can adjust our configuration to minimize the impact of this type of activity.\\n\\nSettlement on a specific block is also not guaranteed, and there may be situations where users vote for a Noun but settlement does not occur. There will be a tradeoff between settlement guarantee, time allowed for voting, and the transaction cost. We will optimize the whole system as much as possible in order to strike the best possible balance between these factors.\\n\\nThe project will require a balance of ETH to settle each auction. Community donations will be needed, after a brief testing period, for the tool to continue to be useful. In addition, gas fees on Ethereum are volatile, so we may need to skip settlement or pay very high fees if the network is congested at the time an auction ends.\\n"},{"blockNumber":13322148,"blockHash":"0xea2c21f3e15cf4ea3d338efb8bce5901e372a2df6cda5dda681a1efe322c6e2a","transactionIndex":238,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x046ab2c53576afdb803899d4aa5a581d0e5b29dc35be9813696f5ebe952f7f90","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":9,"proposer":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","targets":["0xDb94Daa8bF1b6F45B122F442F922a2C4DD2F7aDe"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":13335288,"endBlock":13354998,"description":"# Nouns Bidder POAP\n\nThis proposal is to fund the 1st half of the payment for the Nouns Bidder POAP Project that takes that project to its Season 1 completion.

The threshold is based on a runners-up bidding function.\n\n* A POAP will be rewarded/be able to be claimed by the five (5) runners-up for every auction (unique wallets only, back-and-forth bidding will not be rewarded with multiple POAPs)\n* There will also be one (1) POAP reserved for anyone who settles an auction.\n* The reasoning behind this amendment is for two key reasons.\n  * First: Having unlimited POAPs available with the only requirement being a bid, would open the door to countless spam bidders, resulting in the arbitrary burning of gas.\n  * Second: By restricting the POAPs to only be claimed by the 5 runners-up allows for the value of the POAP to stay in-line with that of Nouns, while still being attainable by a broader audience. If there is an auction that receives exceptionally high offers, the POAP reserved for a Settler, still allows for anyone, no matter the wallet size, to have the chance at receiving a Noun Bidders POAP.\n\n*AMENDMENT ENDS*\n\n**Technical Considerations + Source Code**\n\n* The tech stack will be Typescript, React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS\n* High emphasis on mobile-first usability and functional programming\n* Site will be deployed to Vercel and will use their CI/CD pipeline\n* Code will be open-sourced on Github so others can fork it and create their own POAP claim landing pages in the future\n* We will have both a staging and production site for testing & bug-prevention\n* Leverage the POAP API where possible ([poap.xyz](http://poap.xyz))\n\n**Design**\n\n**![|271x189](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/4f768d722a0618ef433356ceba9900abafb7ca8b_2_271x189.jpeg)**\n* ***Design of the POAP***\n  * Nounish beings by Sun-Min + David\n  * Each Nounish being holds a numbered auction bid paddle marking in history the specific Noun that your bid was counted for\n* ***Design of the Microsite***\n  * Create wireframes in Figma and generate a low-fidelity interactive prototype (mobile and web)\n  * Upload prototype into maze.design and test with the nouns community/discord to ensure that key tasks can be completed\n  * Iterate on prototype to resolve any usability issues based on feedback\n  * Once wireframes are validated, we’ll conduct two rounds of visual design to and share back with community\n    * Leverage tailwind design components for easy and efficient build\n    * Comments will be enabled to review feedback asynchronously and directly in the design\n    * The website will be branded similarly to nouns.wtf (Londrina Solid font for headlines, Segoe UI for body text, grays and whites)\n\n**Project Timeline**\n\nOur team anticipates this project taking approximately 6-8 weeks. You can view our proposed schedule below. (subject to change based on reviews and approvals by the NounsDAO)\n\nCommunity co-creation, as many of the other proposals have stated, is our goal. As you can see below, we will have three dedicated times where we will gather community input through Discord and other channels from the NounsDAO community in order to ship this product with the community’s highest standard in mind.

Here's the final version of the Nouns Comic proposal.\n\n**Nouns and Storytelling.**\n\nIn a world where everything changes, humans have maintained one consistent feature and that’s the “**art of storytelling**”. Storytelling is and has been one of our favorite ways of communication, from cave-drawings and sharing tales of discovering fire to building the metaverse ~ we all want to share stories that we find interesting.\n\n**Why Comics?**\n\nNouns Comic are that fun and engaging tool that we can use to share our interest for Nouns and their exciting universe to build upon. It’s a way to keep that memetic consistency that we so desire to maintain inside the Nouns community/universe. An event, if you will, to gather around and enjoy the things happening in the community with a mixture of my wild imaginations about Nouns and how they’d interact with each other.\n\n**Nouns Comic you say?**\n\n“Nouns Comic #0” is already out and available for the community and all Noun enthusiasts. The full version can be found below.\n\n“Nouns Comic #0” serves as the “**WTF? Handbook**” which is a meme translation of the [Nouns website](https://nouns.wtf) while introducing different concepts like *Noun o’clock*, *Nouns treasury*, *Nouns’ art on-chain* and… in an amusing comedic way in “*internet language*”.\n\n[Nouns Comic #0](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/855538581434007635/894304410182746182/SPOILER_Nouns_Comic_0_-_Final.jpg)\n\n\nMoving forward, all comics will be available for ***free*** on the Nouns Comic website/archive to log the history of Nouns Comic. Everyone will have access to both *.jpeg* and *.pdf* versions of the comic and they will be accessible for everyone. Also, a very limited number of comics will be minted for collectors that are interested in owning a piece of Nouns Comic history that comes with the animated version of the cover.\n\n**Budget and Timeframe**\n\n* 10 days per comic\n* 0.5 ETH per comic\n* Lasting for 3 months (9 issues)\n\nThat will bring the total to **4.5ETH** for **9 upcoming issues** over the span of **3 months** (90 days) to be synced with **Party Nouns** (Nouns ending with 1). \n\nNotes:\n- The comics will be extended over the 3 months period if agreed upon by both parties ~ details will be discussed in a future proposal.\n- 25% of the initial revenue generated from “special editions” will go back to the NounsDAO treasury.\n\n**Proof of Work?**\n\nUndead Oracle here ~ Artist and content-creator focused on internet culture and visual storytelling through art. I’ve always been focused on sharing stories and content with others, from drawing comics and sharing them with my peers throughout school to bringing my collection (“[The Undead](https://opensea.io/collection/theundead)”) to the main-net, I have always focused on storytelling and growing as an artist.\n\nSupport work:\n1.

A Fitz Frames membership includes two complete pairs of prescription eyeglasses with unlimited replacement frames should they lose, break, grow out of the glasses, or their prescription changes.\\nIn addition to their Fitz Frames Membership each child will receive an additional free pair of Noun Frames, glasses that mimic the pair worn by their favorite Noun.\\nAs an initial pilot program, we propose Nouns DAO allocate **9ETH** (~$30,000 worth of ETH) to provide glasses to approximately 300 kids (aprox $100) per child. This will be done with in conjunction with our outreach partner Vision to Learn in an initial focus geography (probably Ohio and/or Detroit). Progress reports will be given to NounsDAO on an ongoing basis, but no less than once a quarter. The pilot program is expected to run approximately 90 days, but children will continue to receive replacement glasses for the full year as needed. The purpose of the pilot program is to validate and refine the offering and delivery process, with the goal of expanding the efforts nationwide and eventually internationally.\\nAt the end of the initial pilot program, Fitz present the results of the program and will put to a vote either a continuation, expansion, or termination of the program.\\nAdditionally, we request **2ETH** in one-time funding to build outreach materials (print, animation, and website) directed towards schools to explain the program, Nouns, Fitz, and the underlying technology of blockchain, NFTs, and additive manufacturing.\\n\\n**Proposal**\\nFitz would like to eventually build to a perpetual funding mechanism in order to expand our existing social good efforts and deliver eyewear on an ongoing basis to kids in need. In the interim, we’d like to propose a pilot program to prove out the model and refine delivery mechanism:\\n- $30K allocation from Nouns treasury to provide approximately 300 no-cost vision tests plus Fitz Frames memberships to kids in need, initially in a limited geographical focus area.\\n- Fitz will provide annual memberships at cost of $100)/kid/year discounted from $185.  Annual Membership consists of two pairs of custom fit glasses plus unliminted replacements.\\n- Fitz will provide an additional free pair of Noun Frames, mimicking their favorite Nouns, limited to an initial selection of 10 Noun options for the Pilot Program.\\n- Vision to Learn, will identify recipients and provide no-cost eye exams within the geographical focus area. Initial prospects are Ohio and Detroit.\\n- Initial Pilot Program is expected to run approximately 90 days, at which point Fitz will present a report of progress to the NounsDAO.\\n- At that point the NounsDAO can vote to expand, continue, or suspend the pilot program.\\n- Based on findings from the initial Pilot Program, elements can be refined including: delivery mechanism, offering, and outreach. Additionally, Fitz Frames will work to try and secure additional underwriting in order to extend the reach of the program. (possibly through Medicaid reimbursement, or local philanthropic partners)\\n\\n- In order to promote the program (and help surface Nouns to a wider public awareness) we propose dedicating an additional 2ETH to develop outreach materials including print, short form animation, and a dedicated website. This will target schools, the student recipients of glasses, and broader public. In addition to promotion of the program, this is an opportunity to introduce the technology elements underpinning both Nouns and Fitz Frames, and develop age-appropriate STEM curriculum for the kids who receive the glasses.\\nNouns is a fantastic example of people leveraging technology to come together and build long-term value in perpetuity.  Fitz leverages the power of technology to change the lives of kids. We think this is a natural partnership that would not only do a tremendous amount of good, but could serve as tangible application of blockchain doing tangible good. At Fitz, we believe that those who can see the world are the ones who can change the world. NounsDAO embodies this ethos completely, and we couldn’t imagine a better partner.\\n\\n**Noun Frames**\\nFitz will integrate Nouns Frames into their application so that users can pick their favorite Noun and receive glasses that mimic those frames as well as have the Noun itself printed on the side of the frames as well as the Noun number printed on the inside.\\n\\n\\n**About Fitz:**\\nFitz Frames: https://www.fitzframes.com/ \\nFitz for Good - how Fitz has worked with VTL to provide glasses for kids in the past:\\n https://vimeo.com/377468371 \\n\\nHow Fitz has worked with Healthcare community to provide protective prescription eyewear to drs and nurses across the country - https://news.yahoo.com/local-hero-nyc-glasses-maker-171104609.html \\n\\nFitz in the Press - How we came to be and why we matter to kids - https://abcnews.go.com/Business/startup-offers-affordable-eyeglasses-kids-flatter-faces/story?id=65014415 \\n\\n**About Vision 2 Learn:**\\nhttps://visiontolearn.org/about/from-the-founder/ \\n"},{"blockNumber":13450388,"blockHash":"0x776e6bdf83becbaeca9be72ea99d03ed31bb35f380c5eb43f053ee32ed37b4ed","transactionIndex":124,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xc86c561060695a37948c4a25fb0129a2fca2eea21b652376d19850bde728f94c","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":13,"proposer":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","targets":["0xd77e44F294938472381A587a47F5D836C6290EA3","0x4939C898da18b0c1E71DC2A42aa545AD228711B5","0x6Dfa20170603c53220cDD61EA8d7DE9b7Ed725Ef","0x095f1fD53A56C01c76A2a56B7273995Ce915d8C4","0xA77a54139b285C5294f24A492B9896c380dDe01D","0x2AF21E37928613582734bcBAeaD0919801a4CAcf","0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d","0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E"],"signatures":["","","","","","","",""],"calldatas":["0x","0x","0x","0x","0x","0x","0x","0x"],"startBlock":13463528,"endBlock":13483238,"description":"# Retroactive Funding and Small Grants Pool\n\n> *tl;dr -- Encourage creators (artists and devs) to build with Nouns by having a pool of funds held in a Safe for this purpose.

A Safe is much quicker mechanism to coordinate and distribute funds. We would like 20 ETH to pilot the pool, with a suggested range of 0.25-2 ETH per project, with the aim of:\n\n1. acknowledging, through retroactive funding, past contributions to the Nouns ecosystem\n1. granting funds for the development of small, one-off, or alpha version projects\n1. encouraging building and signalling that retroactive funding is a viable way to build on Nouns\n\n\n### Funding Committee\nThe initial signing committee on the Safe will be:\n- ![](https://bafkreiagjoe5qu3mcl37dwki2vp4fj4gb7kccmflsn2aaf7tzomoe7kw7a.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 12\n- ![](https://bafkreiffeqnv4rgab7e5o6vmn77ybkp3iuvcgjfu64lpu7yixiwhp7y3ty.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 16\n- ![](https://bafkreigj6v7xwubod6ustllhc5jjrhpeggzsyrmjodvqgq47zshzh2l3xi.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 22\n- ![](https://bafkreifald3ya6i62qy3s2mfefbzxnnkb25wazvqlnco3nr4xzuq6a7pae.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 32\n- ![](https://bafkreiaalajwukk3wfocjcbl6a7uufkcsepeerhvunmnyjewfhnipqn2v4.ipfs.dweb.link/) Nouns DAO\n\nThe Safe will require `2 of 4` Nouners to sign, with Nouns DAO acting as a largely symbolic owner and backup.\n\nThe committee will monitor the builder community, retroactively fund previous work as it comes up, and receive informal requests/applications for small project grants.

Proposal to name a recently discovered species of glass frog after Nouns\n\nI have been informed of an opportunity to name a species of glass frog newly discovered in the Dracula nature reserve in Ecuador. The EcoMinga Foundation (EcoMinga Foundation) is raising funds alongside its partner Rainforest Trust (www.rainforesttrust.org 2) in exchange for the right to name this glass frog.\n\nI’d like to propose that NounsDAO pay 25 ETH to purchase the right to name the frog Hyalinobatrachium Nouns, or Nouns Glassfrog in plain English. As far as I know, naming a species would be a first for the crypto and NFT community. Frogs have memetic value in the NFT community, making this species an appropriate choice for naming. Not only would this story be likely to get picked up by the press and social media, but the money goes to the cause of protecting biodiversity and rainforests.\n\nHere is a link to some photos of the frog, and the scientific write up of the frog's discovery (along with another similar frog). https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w5kmr9hyzvlxjwo/AABrxnch8PAYop8MQ-FTrozEa?dl=0\n\nThe breakdown of the use of funds would be roughly the following, subject to discussions with the non-profits:\n55% to Ecominga for operating and protecting the reserve\n5% to scientific publishing and discovery of new species\n40% to Rainforest Trust’s Climate Action Fund, which funds protection of rainforest to sequester carbon\n\nOnce this proposal passes and the ETH gets sent, I'll calculate the equivalent USD amount and wire the fiat to Rainforest Trust within 5 business days (unfortunately the non-profit doesn't accept crypto donations). Rainforest Trust will then pass on Ecominga's portion to them.

Scope for these contributions is considered open-ended, and will be defined on a monthly cadence with the input of the Nounders & the community. This proposal seeks to bring on three individuals with deep interest in the Nouns ecosystem, and a proven track record of delivering value on short timelines & at an early stage.\n\n### Context\n\nAs part of their original contributions, the Nounders built [Nouns.wtf](http://Nouns.wtf), home to daily Noun auctions, governance, an exploratory playground, and details of the project and its motivations. Given the rapid increase in interest and usage of the Nouns products, we propose bringing on world-class design & engineering resourcing to help iterate on the future of [Nouns.wtf](http://Nouns.wtf).\n\nMany Nounders remain involved in varying capacities in day-to-day community affairs, but the demands of the role are non-trivial and [critical to the success of any DAO](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1450990370528141315?s=20). We propose bringing on a talented community lead who will help strengthen the sense of shared purpose within the Nouns community.\n\n### Scope\n\nScope for these contributors will be defined on an on-going basis with input from Nounders, Noun owners, and the greater Nouns community. Contributors will be expected to communicate their deliverables & timelines in a public manner at least once per month. \n\nFor the design & engineering roles, the initial set of scope includes maintenance and improvements to [Nouns.wtf](http://Nouns.wtf). For the community role, contributions include (but are not limited to) scheduling & leading community calls, internal & external communications, Discord management, and onboarding of new DAO members.\n\n### Expectations\n\nContributors are responsible for documenting and communicating their decisions & output. Updates should be shared early and often, encouraging Nounders and community members to provide input given the shared vision for the Nouns ecosystem. Contributors are expected to be responsive, but are free to define the working style which lends itself to the best outcomes. The commitments will last for **3 months**, or 90 days, after which point this proposal will be resubmitted to extend the working relationship.\n\n### Contributors\n\nInformation on the contributors is available in [this post](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/898682149585162270/907593435417038889) in #private on the Nouns Discord.\n\n### Compensation\n\nWe believe that the NounsDAO could fund this proposal, decreasing the burden of project maintenance on the Nounders and increasing the lifespan of product & community development for the community. For this initial trial, compensation will be paid out via streaming payments on Sablier. Each contributor will be paid `~5.9 ETH` per month, for approximately three months, or `~17.69 ETH` over 91 days. In the case of poor performance, the `cancelStream` method may be invoked, returning funds to an escrow and the contributor(s) pro-rata based on time elapsed.\n\nThe proposal also includes a transfer of `0.22 ETH` to [0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e) as reimbursement for submitting the on-chain proposal."},{"blockNumber":13624234,"blockHash":"0x67ca09f87b0736e51f0482bb80e6b219fd978b3072e72b2e283d9069f9ef19ad","transactionIndex":55,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x2a510fc1f47b63ae7ff0f36e51b7fbf2fffc535185d7bb5130a2dd7110b72fc2","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":18,"proposer":"0x4680cb63563472cac10236C07d288580D8d7B52A","targets":["0xae7ab96520DE3A18E5e111B5EaAb095312D7fE84"],"signatures":["submit(address)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"],"startBlock":13637374,"endBlock":13657084,"description":"# Stake 1 eth in Lido\n\nSeveral people seemed to think adding some % (to be voted on in a later proposal) of treasury to Lido to earn yield was a viable idea.\n\nThis proposal is to see if the majority of nouns are interested in a trial of this process with 1 eth to ensure it works properly.\n\nIf approved we'll presumably have another vote for whether to add more funds, and if so how much."},{"blockNumber":13660107,"blockHash":"0xffa278e62db5b651a9a65de69a9f1d2abbfbb0fd18b3fc75444a3c942bab49b4","transactionIndex":213,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x68545c43a2b609dab568ad2cee1555eee334aa0d145d763f281992e58caca077","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":19,"proposer":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","targets":["0xDb94Daa8bF1b6F45B122F442F922a2C4DD2F7aDe"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":13673247,"endBlock":13692957,"description":"# Completion Payment for Nouns Bidder POAP\n\nThis is the 20 ETH completion payment for the work that the Bidder POAP did per [Proposal 9](https://nouns.wtf/vote/9).

Let’s make it happen and find out!\n\nTo contribute to the elevation of Nouns to cultural icon status, broaden the scope and understanding of what the Nouns characters can be, and also to encourage contribution and interactivity in Nouns-art-making, we will create 4 short films centered around Nouns.\n\nWe will explore the creative potential of Nouns by making each film with totally different genres and techniques. From this we will learn what works, what doesn’t, and inform what motion strategies we should explore next.\n\nThese short films will be the first of their kind, and hopefully will inspire other creators from the broader community to generate more motion projects featuring the Nouns.\n\nThis is just a first step to dip Nouns’ toes in the water of motion storytelling and for us all to learn. We have grand ideas for how this first step can seed one or potentially many Nouns content projects, including but not limited to: creating even more elevated Nouns content, creating a platform for Nouns in motion (or Nouns art generally), an ongoing narrative series, curated anthologies from artists around the world, and community-contributed storytelling.\n\n**The Films**\nWe want to cover as many genres and techniques as possible to be able to experiment and learn from how Nouns translate into all these different outcomes. Ideally, no two films will cover the same ground. Let’s explore...\n\n**Genres:** drama, comedy, experimental, family, action, adventure, romance, adventure, musical, thriller...\n\n**Medium / Technique:** Pixel art, traditional 2D animation, 3D animation, stop-motion, live action, puppetry, augmented reality...\n\nAward winning hybrid production company Pixel and web3 media collective StudioDAO will form the Nouns Stories team and collaborate to create all 4 films. Each film will have a different director but may share some production team members.\n\n**Distribution & Sale**\nWe are currently thinking about releasing one film per week for a month in 2022 (but are open to suggestions or ideas on this). It would be great to premiere them at noun'o'clock every monday for example The films will be made as accessible as possible and shared for free, potentially on many networks and platforms. We believe Nouns content should not be gatekept, our goal should be to reach the largest audience possible (and encourage others to do so).\n\nThe films themselves will be CC0 and everyone will be encouraged to use them however they wish. NounsStories team may decide that its a good idea to enter the films into festivals or other events or platforms around the world to increase both reach and gain prestige. The films shall always remain accessible online (and free) however, and we should not ever conform to any requests to pull them down in order to participate in an event (some film festivals may require this in order to screen at their events).\n\nThe films might also be minted as NFTs, ideally on a custom NounsStories contract, and auctioned off (and pending the level of success, perhaps assets, elements from the production, or offshoot artwork and content could be minted too). Ideally the royalites from these sales would go to the artists that are responsible for the film's creation.\n\n**Contributors & Compensation**\n* 7 ETH for the production of each film\n* 28 ETH total\n\n\n**Pixel**\n* Role: Nouns Stories Creative Direction team + Production Company on 3 films + Marketing and festivals\n* Compensation: 21 ETH\n* Wallet: 0x5184782cC00E90D2E0C82A8f22729f7f38a572B8\n* Handle: @goldypix (on behalf of Pixel)\n\n**StudioDAO**\n* Role: Nouns Stories Creative Direction team + Production Company on 1 films\n* Compensation: 7 ETH\n* Wallet: 0x09907f01d6192192f767deFB01C7Ee10cF82c24c\n* Handle: @studioDao\n\n**Project Timeline**\n\n* Development and Pre Production: 2 months\n* Production & Post Production: 2 months\n* Film Launch: 1 per week for 1 month\n\n\n**Meet the NounStories Team**\n**Pixel**\nAs a production company, Pixel has been creating award winning short form content for over a decade.

[Gitcoin has raised $40 million for open source and public goods funding in its lifetime](https://gitcoin.co/results).  One popular Gitcoin feature has been quarterly funding rounds for grants to public goods and open source projects that are accompanied with quadratic matching by sponsors.  That quadratic matching is designed to assess both the quantity and quality of support that a given project gets, creating an effective way of measuring dollar voting without descending into plutocracy.  These rounds, the energy and money they incubated for public goods, have been a great success for the Ethereum community in general.  Gitcoin has raised tens of millions of dollars through their GRs alone.\n* [Vitalik on Gitcoin](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/10/24/gitcoin.html) \n* [Gitcoin GR12](https://gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-grants-round-12/)\n* [Vitalik on Quadratic payments](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html)\n* [Radical Markets, an overview of Radical Democracy tools like quadatic funding applied to solve economic and other problems](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691177502/radical-markets)\n* [Lemonade Stand, A handy guide to financial support for open source](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand)\n\n**How does Nouns DAO benefit?**\n\n\n* **Fund the public goods from which we were created and on which are future depends.** Who's going to build the roads?

[The Ethereum Foundation is giving $500k specifically for the Advocacy category](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/16/advocacy-grants/) for example.\n* **Make it normative for DAOs to support both crypto and real world public goods just as part of their DNA.**  Everyone benefits from this, it's a good seed for open source crypto and decentralized organizations, because we are and always will be all in this together.  We're leaders, let's lead.\n* **Marketing to the types of creators and builders we want to attract for Nouns proposal that we are open for business.** Gitcoin projects have huge overlap with the types of projects and creators we would consider funding. It's a large gm to them all.\n* **Demonstration that business should be sealed with NFT miscegenation and crossover events**. In this case, between Noun DAO's NFT and Gitcoin's.  Who knows what this type of NFT-rooted relationship could evolve into but there's memetic consistency in sealing a deal with an NFT crossover event.  Worst case, we have created more fun symbolically important art.  Best case it creates deeper ways to engage and collaborate with fellow DAOs or boomer organizations like Arby's.\n\n**Moonshot Nouns**\n* These will be 5 NFTs, made and managed on the Gitcoin side with input from the Nouns side.\n* Will feature both Moonshot Bot and Nounish elements in some fashion.  Obviously, the most distinctive Nounish element are our glasses but there's also the distinctive heads which could be of use.  Artist may make a themed one for each category (Climate, Advocacy, Longevity, Ethereum) and then one uber-one. \n* The uber-one NFT will be auctioned on the 1st or 2nd of the round with an auction set to end on the 2nd to last day of the Round (December 11th).  Auction will be promoted on both Nouns and Gitcoin side. Proceeds will go to Gitcoin general fund or multisig.\n* The category Moonshot Noun NFTs will be doled out to a champion from each category, determined by a process we run on the Nouns side.  Likely a small Nouns team will pick the top 10 projects in each category and then put it up for vote to the public. Potentially we can create a polling page on Nouns.wtf to drive engagement directly to our home rather than Twitter.  TBD.\n* This is all subject to change if a better NFT crossover path and strategy emerge in process or it become unworkable.\n\n * [Decrypt on Moonshot Bot launch](https://decrypt.co/79606/moonshot-bots-nfts-gitcoin-ethereum-grants-1-8-million)\n* [Moonshot Bots](https://bots.moonshotcollective.space/)\n* [Moonshot Collective](https://moonshotcollective.space/)\n\n\n![E9f3Y__VUAg47fL|690x349](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/9c6985a26194d4e43142051f595aa90d93c95f96_2_690x349.jpeg)\n\n**Steps and Timing**\n\n1.

At the end of each auction, Noun owners (Nouners) vote on which proposal gets funded.\n\nThis proposal aims to be the MVP for a trustless on-chain solution.\n\n### Why?\nThe NounsDAO treasury is accruing capital at a $100M+ annual run rate. While NounsDAO has pushed several proposals through to execution, the current funding process does not seem like the optimal approach to scaling to thousands of projects. Prop House is an exploration of an alternative funding mechanism: forced treasury spend that minimizes friction to propose while maintaining quality via Nouns DAO member votes.\n\n#### Forced treasury spend\nIf the underlying thesis behind Nouns DAO is that the more a meme is spread, the more its provenance is worth, then spending the treasury to proliferate Nouns 1 makes a lot of sense. Assuming there is ongoing supply of ideas to proliferate Nouns, Prop House aims to force perpetual spend to capture this supply.\n\n#### Minimizing friction\nAnyone who wants to build on Nouns 2 is encouraged to do so. To this end, there is documentation and guidance to help builders get funded as quickly as possible. Still, proposing to the DAO involves friction. It means joining a new community, proposing an idea, getting sponsorship, achieving community consensus and more. The process can take a week or more before proposing on-chain which takes yet another week. Prop House could alleviate some of this friction by redirecting focus to the proposal itself instead of other functions.\n\n#### Quality\nAssuming that being able to amass the significant amount of capital required to buy a Noun is correlated to being a good capital allocator, NounsDAO members represent a pool of intellectual capital that could be used as a quality filter for the best use of the Prop House auction funds.\n\n### How would it work?\nFunds requested from the DAO would be sent to a 2/3 safe controlled by cryptoseneca, devcarrot and Pixelz. The funds would be used to run three auctions of varying amounts and run times, for example:\n\n* 5 ETH with a 7 day proposal and 3 day voting period.\n* 10 ETH with a 14 day proposal and 3 day voting period.\n* 20 ETH with a 21 day proposal and 3 day voting period.\n\nThe differing amounts and run times are to test which scale (if any) is best suited for the format.\n\nA web app will be built as the home for the project where both auctions and voting will take place. Auctions will run for their allotted time, allowing anyone to bid with a proposal. The consecutive voting period will have Nouners vote for the proposal of their choice. At the end of the voting period, the funds will be transferred to the proposal with the most votes.\n\n### Funds Requested\nThis proposal requests a total of 36 ETH from the DAO:\n\n* 35 ETH to fund three auctions.\n* 1 ETH for operational spend\n\n### Who is behind this proposal?\nseneca, one of the Nouns project founders. I will be building Prop House alongside devcarrot (Nounder) and Pixelz (designer) with help from the rest of the Nounders.\n\n### Mock Up\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZRDauGe.png)\n\n\n### Other Considerations\nProp House aims to be the MVP of a trustless on-chain solution. If the experiment succeeds, the next logical step would be to build an unopinionated suite of contracts that automate the process.\n\nConceptually, the contracts could be the seed to a crypto native Y Combinator model. Where as before you had partners, now you have DAO members. Instead of summer and winter batches, you have weekly or monthly cadences. And instead of demographic restrictions for applicants, you have anyone with an Ethereum wallet. It might be the case that breaking thresholds in the categories mentioned above transforms the model to something completely different."},{"blockNumber":13721736,"blockHash":"0x2cc4b4dcf4cdc534215bd7608724916d9d384d974de6dbea0da8f72ce1345dc7","transactionIndex":44,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x9ef368d4a7b14f75092c403d3b8b35265be0998c162267ed5c9d5b0670eba80e","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":24,"proposer":"0xAe7f458667f1B30746354aBC3157907d9F6FD15E","targets":["0xC36f41b8Da70aF447F6383a9E85287016e874bC7","0x05B98Dd27D50B0B9dAF1b3Be7F299e7362B26B2E","0xBd7Dbab9AEb52D6c8d0E80fCeBdE3af4CC86204A"],"signatures":["","",""],"calldatas":["0x","0x","0x"],"startBlock":13734876,"endBlock":13754586,"description":"# Noun Tracks - Unlocking the sounds of Nouns\n\n\nAuthors: Arpeggi Labs, Nate Fox & Joshua Fisher.\n\n## **TL;DR**\nNoun Tracks are the fully on-chain 1:1 CC0 theme songs of a Noun created using Arpeggi Labs' on-chain DAW with samples and patterns performed and written by Nate Fox.\n\nTogether we will develop and launch Noun Tracks.  These NFT's are claimable for Nouners plus all the tools will be public and sounds will be compeletely CC0 for the community to enjoy.\n\n## **How?**\n### Part 1 - The Noun Track Stack\nNouns have a stack of visual characteristics that make them unique, with Noun Tracks now they have their own sounds too!\n\nNoun Tracks contain a 1:1 sonic representation of every layer of a Noun. \n\nEach visible layer of the Noun corresponds to a unique component of the song:\n\n\n**Layer 1 - Backgrounds (2)** - Key, either Major or Minor.\n\n```\nKey_Background {\n    boolean major;\n} \n```\n\n**Layer 2 - Bodies (30)** - Chord Progressions containing unique Bass & Harmony patterns and samples. These correspond to the \"body\" of the song.\n\n```\nChordProgression_Bodies {\n\tPattern bass;\n\tPattern harmony;\n\tSample bassSample;\n    Sample harmonySample;\n}\t\n```\n\n**Layer 3 - Accessories (137)** - Drum Loops containing unique snare, hat, percussion and kick patterns and samples. These provide a nice \"accessory\" to the other melodic components to the song.\n\n```\nDrumLoop_Accessory {\n    Pattern kick.\n    Pattern snare;\n    Pattern hat;\n    Pattern perc;\n    Sample kickSample;\n    Sample snareSample; \n    Sample hatSample;\n    Sample percSample;\n}\n```\n\n**Layer 4 - Heads (234)** - Lead Sample and Sound Effects. 234 Sample + Sound Effect combinations give each Noun. \nThese custom Lead Samples plus fun FX Sample moments give each Noun Track a distinctive personality. For example, Nouns with the shark head will have a shark chomp sound effect!\n\n```\nFX_Heads {\n    Sample lead;\t\n    Pattern fx;\n    Sample fxSample;\n} \n```\n\n**Layer 5 - Glasses (21 patterns)** - Lead Pattern, aka the musical notation of the Lead Sample produced by Nate.\n\n```\nLead_Glasses {\n\tPattern lead;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Part 2 - Construction of a Noun Track\nOnce an auction is settled and a new Noun appears a new Noun Track is created and minted! \n\nUsing a custom \"Noun Track Creation Contract\" Arpeggi will pull the correspoding Samples and Patterns from the current Nouns features to create each days Noun Track. \n\n**Example Noun Track**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJaT7N4OY.png)\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryOUougFt.png)](https://vimeo.com/647873210)\n\n\n\n```\nNoun_Track {\n\tKey_Background key;\n    ChordProgression_Bodies chords;\n    DrumLoop_Accessory drums;\n    FX_Heads fx;\n    Lead_Glasses lead;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n**Additional Noun Tracks Samples**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJbJ4ENut.png)\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJyni_xFt.png)](https://vimeo.com/647873573)\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rydSUNEOF.png)\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Syc0odgKt.png)](https://vimeo.com/647873417)\n\n\n(*please note that this was created using a BETA Version of Arpeggi Nouns where Percussion field was used or FX.  The final version will have greater flexibility)\n\n### Part 3 - Minting & Distribution \n\nEvery Noun has a corresponding Noun Track that can be claimed by the Noun owner. A Nouner simply connects the wallet to NounTracks.wtf and they can claim their corresponding Noun Track.\n\nIn addtion to the NFT being minted the Noun Track will be simultaneously uploaded w/ it's Noun artwork to the traditional music DSP's and platforms. Using a platform such as Revelator's on-chain IP rights management system the royalties generated will be split between NounsDAO, the Nouner, and the creators at 33.3% each. \n\nDon't worry if you don't own a Noun. All tools are public and the music is CC0 so feel free to have some fun!\n\n## Who:\nApreggi Studios: Creators of the world's first on-chain music creation platform.\narpeggi.io\nhttps://medium.com/@arpeggilabs/arpeggi-studio-4bf465348d51\n\nNate Fox: Grammy awarded producer and songwriter who has worked with artists ranging from Chance The Rapper to Randy Newman. \nhttps://artists.spotify.com/songwriter/0uZyVM4hASpRCJgEUr6iIs\nhttps://music.apple.com/us/playlist/nate-fox-behind-the-boards/pl.84c458559b35469c9f7a88361ff959f5\n\nJoshua Fisher: Creative manager, SharkDAO member, Noun Prop Builder and Web3 enthusiast.\n\n## Costs:\nWe've broken down the cost into two Phases, with Phase 1 being paid a portion up front and portion upon launch.

I want to test the boundaries of the latest printing tech, whether it be FDM, SLS, Polyjet etc. As with all my past work, the goal is to get the collection to be showcased in different tech conferences, fashion events, galleries, and museums.\n\nI am a 3D printing fashion pioneer and my fashion collections have been showcased in all the top traditional media outlets worldwide ([NYT, WSJ, Bloomberg, BBC, The Guardian, Forbes, Vogue, ELLE, etc 1](https://danitpeleg.com/press/)) countless events (including the Rio opening ceremony at Paralympics and Mercedez-Benz fashion week), [museums](https://tinyurl.com/2p8zbz79), documentaries, newspapers, books. And my [TED talk](https://tinyurl.com/yck4y4y7) and other videos have received millions of views.\n\n![a](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/fe034281879ef6823716ab09d732ab4e3bc2de66.jpeg)\nFrom inspiration through 3D modeling to printing to AR\n\n![121211920×347 45.2 KB](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/240afcddeedf303c85dca2c8eb555e685553dae9.jpeg)\n\nLiberty Leading the People Collection\n\n**Why am I excited about this?**\n\nThis year began for me with unbounded excitement about the potential impact of NFTs on fashion, both physical and digital. I [experimented with minting some of my pieces](https://rarible.com/danitpeleg3d), bought different kinds of NFTs, and bonded with awesome artists (mainly female ones!). Ever since I heard about Nouns, I have been thinking about how I can bring my skills and know-how to contribute to Nouns' culture.\n\nI came up with a few concepts like nouns' merch etc' but then I realized:\n\nNouns can help me **push my creative and technical boundaries to bring the most innovative fashion collection to life**, and I can help **proliferate Nouns to new audiences!**\n\nWith Nouns' funding, I can spend the next few months working on what I love the most (making 3D-printed fashion, pushing the boundaries of the possible with the current technology). And with the result - a uniquely wearable Nounish 3D-printed fashion collection - Nouns and NounsDAO story can proliferate and get known with new audiences (like, more women, 3d printing enthusiasts, digital fashionistas, fashion students, and more!)\n\n**How will the collection proliferate Nouns?**\n\nI wanted to touch on this because it's the key question: how will people hear about this? how will this get attention?\n\nMy two last big collections, the 2015 [\"Liberty Leading the People\" 1](https://tinyurl.com/yt6dj264) and the 2017 [\"Birth of Venus](https://danitpeleg.com/the-birth-of-venus/)\", both received incredible amounts of press coverage. Why? because they both had strong underlying stories. The Liberty collection was a \"first\" - it was the first 3D printed fashion collection printed entirely at home, and the Birth collection was based on the 3D printed dress I [made for the Paralympics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcvYRjWdfyU), and also it contained the first commercially available [3D printed jacket](https://danitpeleg.com/product/create-your-own-3d-printed-jacket/).\n\n![danit-peleg-venus-1_(1)1800×1008 183 KB](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/4a4ddc3a75d3493d6859cb613d453922ff589842.jpeg)\n\n![WhatsApp_Image_2021-11-02_at_1.33.55_PM1600×857 219 KB](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/11f4fea59fd76560d03d3fd969035d83e7ea6cfe.jpeg)\n\nThe Nouns + Innovative tech + Fashion angle will surely fascinate many. A good story will be crafted, and I am sure that this collection will get a lot of attention because it is touching on all the most fascinating topics of our times: cryptoculture, 3D printing, digital fashion, AR etc'\n\n**So, what are the phases required to produce a 3D-printed fashion collection?**\n\n1.  **Research** - Inspiration board, material research, printing samples\n2.  **Design** - sketches (and more sketches)\n3.  **Modeling** - 3D modeling the sketches into 3D-printable files (working with **zeeraffe)**\n4.  **Print testing** - testing many different types of printers, configurations, materials etc\n5.  **Printing finals** - printing the entire collection\n6.  **Assembling** - using different techniques (e.g. gluing, knotting, etc) to assemble the collection together\n7.  **Photoshoot** (with real-life models) - for press materials, websites, AR filter etc\n8.  **Runway show** - either invited to showcase at an event like nft.nyc, fashion weeks etc'\n9.  **Marketing** - prepare press kit, the collection get PR, is booked for events, and showcases galleries & museums\n\n**Budget & next steps**\n\nTo kickoff phases 1+2, I am asking **3.15 ETH** so I can commit to start the creative process, defining the technology I need to use as well as developing a detailed budget.\n\n**Deliverables for this first phase:**\n* Creating a full sketchbook of what I envision the collection will look like\n* A robust budget for phases 4-9 that can then be presented to the community for feedback.\n\nJust to give a sense of the sizing of this project to reduce uncertainty --- and it really all depends on the type of technologies we will use for printing (e.g. polyjet is MUCH more expensive than FDM) --- I estimate a full fashion collection can be done for **$80K-150K.**\n\n![https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/9a898527788f6f81df411e5d32a0b5a10ab083dd_2_244x400.jpeg](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/9a898527788f6f81df411e5d32a0b5a10ab083dd_2_244x400.jpeg)  ![https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/d3a3cc6a176310931bd8351c6f3e191148302495_2_276x142.jpeg](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/d3a3cc6a176310931bd8351c6f3e191148302495_2_276x142.jpeg) ![https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/3e73dd086b1500552ad124d0bfd3629b0a719ec5_2_108x375.jpeg](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/3e73dd086b1500552ad124d0bfd3629b0a719ec5_2_108x375.jpeg)\n\n*A 3D printed noun sample of textile idea and a sketch of one of the outfits*\n\n![https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/7a10dea807982fcc6c42bdbdf2fa9028a53ebeb3.gif](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/7a10dea807982fcc6c42bdbdf2fa9028a53ebeb3.gif)\n*A 3d-printed fabric I created in the past year, I would like to use this tech in this collection*\n\nFor this project, I will be collaborating with Zeeraffe, a 3D Modeller and Developer who created [Turn a Noun](https://opensea.io/collection/turnanoun).\n\n\n*A bit more about me:*\nI’m a 3D printed fashion designer. I recently filed 2 patents about soft 3D printable materials. I believe that 3D printing opens up fascinating new opportunities in fashion, combined with the power of NFTs my vision of downloading and printing clothes is closer than ever.\n\nIn 2018, I was recognized as one of Europe’s Top Women in Tech by Forbes. In 2019, the BBC named me as one of the 100 most inspiring and influential women in the world. In 2021 I opened the first 3D printable fashion NFTs store. I was fascinated to learn about the nouns movement and want to contribute so I can learn more about how the DAO is operating from first hand. I’m passionate about making this innovative collection inspired by the cool nouns!\n\nYou can read more about me here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danit_Peleg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danit_Peleg)\n\n[Previous discussions & more details on Discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-3d-printed-fashion-collection/402)\n"},{"blockNumber":13749639,"blockHash":"0x3ccd40896bcb43885a7ec7b7b5fb16d74cc0ea422f62aa32b6ec30474bda7e2a","transactionIndex":171,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xe9e897067c64b989130686fd69f89860776fa16c4ea0a28288bbe7cc2854c644","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":27,"proposer":"0x3dbDF1a202d21aaC3309d91dAcFCEF84B8873f7a","targets":["0x5D9275CFfdB2E68000a3758fE83439a27B666963"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":13762779,"endBlock":13782489,"description":"# Nouns Center by cdt.eth\n\nadapted from cdt.eth's post on discourse:  \n\n![n](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/70ba17820156a1a258994d06263ec04c7de22a14.png)\n\n## Who is behind this proposal?\n\n**[cdt.eth ](https://twitter.com/cdt_eth) -** [Christian ](https://twitter.com/cdt_eth) is a software engineer who has worked on the [Nouns POAP](https://nounspoap.com/) team, created [ToadzToolz ](https://toadztoolz.com/) for Cryptoadz, and [SharkDAO’s ](https://sharkdao.community/) website as well as the forthcoming SharkDAO PFP project and a secret Nouns project with [12BNoun ](https://twitter.com/12bnoun). He’s also opened some PRs on https://nouns.wtf/ and has been an early-supporter of Nouns.\n\n## What is it?\n\n[Nouns Center ](https://twitter.com/NounsCenter) ([nouns.center ](https://nouns.center/)) will be a home for the Nouns community. The hope is to document all existing creators & projects, and help people discover the hundreds of new ones that will launch in the future. I did something similar with the Cryptoadz community by creating [ToadzToolz.com ](https://toadztoolz.com/toolz), but that was mainly to showcase projects. Whereas my vision for Nouns Center is to serve the community in 3 main ways.\n\n**1. Knowledge Center**\n\n* Brand & product design resources\n* A traditional help center\n* Responses from Nounders to FAQs\n\n**2. Project Aggregator**\n\n* showcase all projects built off Nouns\n* prove the power & track scale of CC0\n* inspire more art & derivatives\n\n**3.

Until the forthcoming Design System is released, which can also live on this site. Imagine simply visiting [ `https://nouns.center/assets` ](https://nouns.center/assets) and finding everything you need to work and create with Nouns. Whether that be PNGs for artists or links to the folder on Github. The answers to all questions asked should be one link away.\n\n![i|450x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/68dd2750be337c655a27f75d160b1ff6425f6c53.png)\n\nMy second pitch is to the Nounders to open their Discussions forum feature on [the monorepo ](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo) to begin to capture all the answers they give to user questions every day. I added some example categories below to help visualize this. We could break up question types be category and begin to collect dozens of questions & answers in each section. The Nounders have spent a ton of time answering every question imaginable and very thoroughly, on a daily basis and I want to give them their time back. It will be some work up front to get the Discussions content up and running, but to have a technical content repository would be invaluable.\n\n![a](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/f99536abdd4a03261d7e5a13aab4c52a0fbaad5f.png)\n\nGithub Discussions is free, comes with Search built-in, and the Nounders are Github-native. My plan is to fetch this data and bring it into the site. Imagine, if someone has a question they could simply visit [https://nouns.center/dev ](https://nouns.center/) to find all these answers, and I would fetch the data on this new site because artist and non-devs could benefit as well. Those who don’t have a Github account nor would ever go to the Developer channel on Discord could simply go to [https://nouns.center/artist ](https://nouns.center/) to find questions answered already about where to find assets, how to compose a Nouns, canvas dimensions etc.\n\nIt will snowball once the infrastructure is in place.\nQuestions will be asked once, and linked forever.\n\n# 2) Project Aggregator\n\nI’ve aggregated every piece of Nouns content (so far) that I could find in [this spreadsheet. ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QlE93Uv4L3pTOPmrgLvr1NinPDB6atQ_ZbbU6vkHmXs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nIt’s a lot. We’ve done a lot. I want to showcase all this effort.\n\n![r](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/71224aa3e3eadc1c68f37dee22632c5707ab51bb.jpeg)\n\nImagine going to [ `https://nouns.center/projects` ](https://nouns.center/) and being able to see and access every single derivative, podcast episode, proposal project, YouTube video, and news story about Nouns. We should have a one-stop-shop for that as well. It should be compelling visually and truly highlight the power of CC0 and our community. We’ll highlight creators and link to their profiles as well. I’ll create a backlog submission system so we can capture user-submitted projects to streamline the process of getting added to the site. I did this with [https://toadztoolz.com/ideaz ](https://toadztoolz.com/ideaz).\n\nI want to inspire the next hundred projects to spawn out of Nouns,\nand we’ll be ready to give them the tools to do so.\n\n# 3) Onboarding Ramp\n\nLastly, I’d like to reduce as much friction as possible with people understanding the concepts & processes of NounsDAO. I’d like to find an artist to help with create some infographics about some key aspects of Nouns to help explain concepts like Proposals (How to Submit, Criteria, Timeline, and Payment), the Auction & Settlement process, buying a Noun = 1 vote in Dao, cloning & getting the Nouns webapp running locally for devs etc etc. There’s plenty of room to play with here, and yes, all these questions can be answered by a long paragraph of copy, but I loved what The Oracle did with the Proposal infographic.\n\n![h](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/91dea0df191f4f42c0f030955f4ae66108b32e22.jpeg)\n\nand SharkDAO has an excellent one explaining its role within the NounsDAO. I believe these things work and they help solidify the concepts for folks. Plus it adds an air of Nouns both high-quality and creatively capable.\n\n![b](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/53d2efcd3848707f471b3281f91f68d1d62c9a90.png)\n\nMake the unknowns, known.\nLet builders get back to building.\n\n## Where Does This Go?\n\nSome random thoughts where this could go in the future:\n\n* integrate Nouns official Design System?\n* sub-DAO onboarding?\n* Nouns Newsletter?\n* Verb Team [Nouns O’Clock integration](https://www.notion.so/Nouns-Automations-using-Integromat-Zapier-7f3af840dc1d4a04b1d728f978c785b0) to build something off auction endings?\n* Specific Nouns lore (integrate with [nouns.wtf](http://nouns.wtf/) sub-pages? show projects using a specific Noun in them?)\n* [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) meetups with [3D Nouns ](https://3dnouns.com/)?\n* _________________?\n\nRight now my plan is to establish this site as the central resource hub to serve the DAO and our community. Once the solid foundation is established the site can serve as a flywheel for creativity and projects to be housed and built on top of it.\n\n## Funds Requested\n\nThis proposal requests a total of 15 ETH from the DAO for design, development, planning, commissioning an artist, and maintenance for 6 months.\n\n\n\n"},{"blockNumber":13797487,"blockHash":"0xcbb8e9cd077a1e26a44164fecedad0454d587bffc0e72850b5fd836b05835800","transactionIndex":293,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xb572f919746236dfc74b3dfa322cabe738c75e96cd45c7165bfcf097a32ee967","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":28,"proposer":"0x01dB485f57Dc000E761b85641F78C9D212A2eEaB","targets":["0xaA4A036363AFc0a0767E517F7639F067eedD1600"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":13810627,"endBlock":13830337,"description":"# Send a Noun to the International Space Station\n\nI’ve been speaking to a space company (name is confidential) that sends cargo up to the International Space Station (ISS) and assigns tasks (such as experiments) to astronauts on board. I’d like to propose sending a 3d printed Noun to the ISS. This would be the first time a crypto or NFT character has ever traveled in space, and would generate a lot of publicity and forever be part of Nouns lore. The memes that can be generated from this event would be endless. With this project, Nouns DAO would be pushing the boundary of what crazy things can be achieved by DAOs.\n\nDANIT will design and 3D print the Noun to be delivered into space. She will send it to the company, where it will put the figurine through a variety of tests to make sure it is safe for entering space. \n\nNoun 22 will provide governance and an extra pair of eyes on all communications with the company to make sure everything is done above board. \n\nLaunch will occur sometime in H2 2022. The Noun will get sent up on a Space X (or similar) rocket to the ISS. Astronauts will take a picture of the Noun, with various backgrounds such as the inside of the space station and the window looking out on the Earth.

The donut is on top of Randy’s Donuts in Ingelwood, California.\n\n**Placement**: Fabricate & Place Nouns Glasses On Randy’s Donut\n\n**Renderings**:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JUYEIIF.jpg)\n\n**Contributor Info**: My name is Josh and I own Plutus Media, a full service marketing agency based in NYC. In collaboration with a Los Angeles based business partner, WOW Media, I am proposing this unique outdoor placement for the Nouns! I am able to place media on Randy’s Donuts, a landmark donut shop in Inglewood, CA. Maybe you’ve seen it featured in Iron Man 2 when Tony Stark was eating a donut in the Iron Man suit on the donut.\n\n**Where**?: Randy’s Donuts- 805 W Manchester Blvd, Inglewood, CA 90301\n\n**When**?: Based on time to go live, the placement is available the entire month of March. So any week within March can be reserved.\n\nMy goal for this is to present the Nouns with a unique and viral outdoor advertising opportunity worthy of the DAO and Nouns brand. Something that everyone will talk about, share, and appreciate.\n\nThis outdoor placement is in true Nouns style, and not the typical Times Square NFT placement. The donut is also illuminated when the sun is down, so the donut will always be visible since Randy’s is open 24/7. The placement can be live for up to 3 weeks.\n\nThis Nouns glasses placement involves fabricating an over 30 foot pair of Nouns glasses and placing them directly in front of Randy’s Donut. Glasses will be fabricated using an aluminum frame with fabric, vinyl or mesh stretched over the frame to match artwork.

Update the UX of the auction page and integrate it with the Noun profile pages\n2. Update the UX of the governance page\n3. Update the UX of the proposal page\n\nI achieved all of these goals during Prop 17. In addition, I also took it upon myself to do the following:\n\n1. Created the (recently revamped) nounsstats.wtf page which provides insight into Noun rarity and Noun Governance participation\n2. Created (pro bono) a bot to automatically create snapshot votes for Shark DAO based on the creation of new on-chain Nouns DAO proposals\n3. Helped automate parts of Bidder POAP\n4. Review PRs for nouns.wtf\n\n### What I will do during my next residency\n\nI have two main goals for my next residency:\n\n#### Continue to maintain nouns.wtf\n\nI will be taking on more of an ownership role of nouns.wtf going forward. This means that in addition to reviewing inbound PRs, I will be responsible for ongoing bug fixes and improvements. \n\nOne particular task to call out as part of improvements is getting to a few UI details that we didn't have time for during Prop 17 (ex: bid history modal).\n\n#### Make nouns.wtf more robust, extensible, and contributor friendly\n\n1. Revamp CI / CD pipeline to allow easy deploy to prod (process right now is very manual)\n2. Add real time error monitoring so we can rollback bad changes quickly with minimal negative user impact\n3. Generally improve code quality and documentation of the codebase to make it more contributor friendly (in particular, documentation around our Github processes to make it easier for new contributors to onboard)\n4. Refactor nouns.wtf to use a nouns component library to allow people to easily build on our “look and feel”\n5. Localize nouns.wtf to increase the reach of our brand to non-english audiences \n6. Security audit to assess risk and patch any potential exploits should they exist\n\n### Proposed workflow\n\nI propose the following framework for tracking my progress and giving the DAO visibility into my work. \n\n#### Monthly updates\n\nI will give monthly written updates to the DAO. These will be akin to investor update emails.\nThey will include:\n1. What did I say I was going to get done last month\n2. What of that did I actually get done\n3. What am I committing to getting done in the coming month\n\n#### Project scoping docs\n\nFor every distinct project I take on, I will write a short scoping doc (1-2 pages) which I will share with the community for visibility (either on Discord or Github). In this context one project roughly equals one bullet point in the section of my goals (ex: localize nouns.wtf would be one project).\n\nThese scoping docs will include the following information:\n1. Project goals (project must do x, should do y)\n2. Project non-goals (what, if anything, is explicitly out of scope)\n3. High level description of technical aspects of proposed change\n4. Project milestones with ETAs\n\n#### Github projects + Discord\nIn addition to tracking progress at the project level, I will continue to use Github issues, Github projects, and frequent updates to the Nounders (in a private project Discord channel) to promote accountability and give the DAO visibility into my daily work. \n\n\n### Proposed compensation\n\nI propose that I am compensated 62.52414 ETH over 6 months (10.42069 ETH per month distributed via a Sablier stream).\n\nI think this is a fair rate for 2 reasons:\n1. 22's recent proposal passed at this rate. We were both previously funded by Prop 17\n2. This rate is fairly in line (in fact a bit lower) on an annualized + USD converted basis with what I was making in my previous normie tech job / what I was offered by normie tech companies when I recently interviewed (~4 months ago)\n\n\n\n### Closing thoughts\n\nI believe that over the last 3 months, I've show that I can execute with little oversight and generate value for the DAO (in excess of original project scope). I have greatly enjoyed building with all of you over the last 3 months and hope you will give me the opportunity to continue with you on this great journey."},{"blockNumber":14450913,"blockHash":"0x21b40a5bff3cbf24ce4ccf50264a9ae6df29dc029d75f6c7f3e9bf2a221b10e7","transactionIndex":88,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x4e9ccc2c8203d6f0a12b0af03c06edd6dbaf72a3ccce3d390a4bc98530fceab7","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":46,"proposer":"0x17cd072cBd45031EFc21Da538c783E0ed3b25DCc","targets":["0x3DF056D7aCd4F83dcb63c7B0E9cfd92DBe9C34CB"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":14464053,"endBlock":14483763,"description":"# Marketplace Pod Proposal\n\n## Goal\n\nCreate a Nouns marketplace for originals and extension projects.\n\n## Why?\n\n* Create a free marketplace for secondary sales of Nouns.\n* Facilitate the exentions ecosystem: make it easier to search and discover the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nBuild distribution for the NounsDAO: build community and liquidity that NounsDAO can use to potentially curate in the future.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* 0% fees\n* No official endorsement of derivatives\n* Linked to from nouns.wtf header\n* Feels nounish in branding and aesthetic\n* Entirely open source\n* Low barrier to entry for derivatives to be added to the marketplace\n* This will be manually operated to start and managed by the marketplace pod.\n* We can work on an automated and more trustless way to recognize derivatives and get closer to permissionless listings.\n\n## Budget\n\n50 ETH for 6 months of marketplace pod operations\n\n## Milestones\n\n* Design sign off from community\n* 2-4 weeks initial development time\n* Deployed at nouns.town domain (need to confirm)\n* Marketplace launch with initial batch of derivatives\n* Offchain orders\n* Add in Daily Nouns Auction experience\n* Automated derivative addition\n* [Stretch]: Aggregate other marketplaces\n* [Stretch]: Enable swaps\n\n## Team\nNoun 174 ([Jacob](https://twitter.com/js_horne))\nNoun 178 ([Blequity](https://twitter.com/BlequityDAO))\n\n## Disclosure:\nWe are the co-creators of Zora, the NFT marketplace protocol.

The project has a special bidding mechanic that encourages people to donate more.\n\nThe interesting thing is that you can not only mint toadz, but also match or increase the last donation for an already minted toad and it will automatically be transferred into your wallet. The toad will then drop its noun glasses as POAP in the wallet of the original holder.\n\nThis mechanism is coded directly in the smart contract and a toad owner cannot prevent the toad from hopping into another wallet. The idea is that this will encourage people to donate more. If they want to keep their toad they need to increase the price of the donation or acquire back the toad if somebody donated more.\n\n### Why not donate directly to Unchain?\n\nThe idea is to gamify the donation experience so people will donate more. For example, NounsDAO can donate for already minted toadz and “steal” them from the previous owners. Some of them will then donate again to get their toad back.\n\nThe goal of the proposal is to donate 0.2 ETH for 5 toadz that are already minted and “steal” them from the previous owners and also raise the prices for two other toadz to 10 ETH and 40 ETH respectively.\n\n### Transactions\n\nThe following transactions shall be executed if the proposal is approved:\n\nDonate 5x 0.2 ETH for Rescue Toadz #2, #5, #6, #11 and #16\nDonate 10 ETH for Rescue Toad #15\nDonate 40 ETH for Rescue Toad #8\n\n## Conclusion\nDonating 51 ETH through the Rescue Toadz project has the following benefits:\n\nFunds raised by NounsDAO to help Ukrainian people recover from the war\nRaised popularity of the Rescue Toadz charity project, so more people start donating\nPeople that had their Rescue Toad taken from them are incentivized to get it back by donating again.\nRecue Toadz or Noun Glasses NFTs collected by the NounsDAO"},{"blockNumber":14543733,"blockHash":"0x90083bc62e26bff101a639da0edf2b494fd1386e1b9a73a6d45c527231be4263","transactionIndex":103,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x1d06996dda2a07a5cd2c4c7bc97927fe6717c511f3f2b9d53ae020b25c108189","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":51,"proposer":"0x387a161C6b25aA854100aBaED39274e51aaffffd","targets":["0x0658f4eD17289144717713ADfFC2539eF7c2EF8e"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":14556873,"endBlock":14576583,"description":"# Gnars x Nouns Athletes\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/df0297e0030a5dda9107d39db82d67e739e58687.png)\n\n**Background: [Nouns Athletes](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-nouns-athletes/731)** received 3 ETH in funding from Small Grants for a proof of concept.

Gnars DAO (enthusiasts) proliferating Nouns DAO (professionals)...\n\n## Sub-DAOs\n\nNouns DAO inherently [faces a number of challenges](https://twitter.com/0xigami/status/1511601988915523585) around ideation and capital deployment, due to the broadness of application that comes with such an ambitious project.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/336a6169a8e534d0e5a38077c5ea7b24a1cfc1d2_2_690x357.png)\n\nAs of 22 March 2022, Nouns DAO has:\n* Received 23,421 ETH\n* Sent 4,784 ETH\n    * Staked 3,000 in Lido\n    * Spent 458 on Foundation setup and ops\n\n**Only 1,326 ETH has been spent on directly proliferating Nouns,** which represents **just 5.66% of total funding raised,** most of which is not visible on the chart above.\n\nSub-DAOs may address the deal flow problems faced by a generalist organisation such as Nouns, by operating as an intermediary for impactful and domain specific capital deployment.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/192fa943b3337ed1990092839abbdadd1b181009_2_690x288.png)\n\nGnars began as a simple experiment to see how people value team contributions versus allocation of funds toward meaningful and well aligned charitable causes. As expected, collectors want to see what the future holds and therefore tend toward adequately funding a team – tested using a [Humble Bundle inspired](https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/204387088-Pay-What-You-Want-and-Contribution-Sliders) contribution slider.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/3e838186abf3c575e92ffe393b44445d749b2258_2_690x239.png)\n\nBut perhaps more abstractly, the project was intended to serve as a dip of the toe, to understand whether I personally, should “Skate or DAO?” Having quickly attracted a community of talented and passionate individuals, I’ve discovered that the answer is unequivocally “DAO.”\n\nConnecting with the community has helped me to understand that we are uniquely positioned for experimentation. As a laser focused sub-DAO we can recruit and grow an extreme sports team through fan engagement. \n\nI’m proposing a domain specific sub-DAO structure **– a *SHRED*.**\n\n## Gnars DAO\n\nSkate or DAO -> Shred the Nouns 🤘\n\nGnars aims to operate as a ***Streamlined Hierarchical Really Excellent DAO (SHRED)*** and while the name is a stretch, the concept of ‘shredding the nouns’ can be hyper-focused and impactful.\n\nThe structure allows for off-chain voting with on-chain execution, without dependence on a single centralised entity. This hybrid model is more accessible since individual voters won’t need to pay gas. But it’s also an adequately secure means of sub-DAO treasury stewardship.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/b74c48999630dffa607bfd7cbc72f059732d72ee_2_690x238.png)\n\n[Zodiac Reality Module](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-reality/get-started/) ([I've deployed here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xca553AC295EDA95594e77Aa97525Fc815090589a)) enables on-chain execution based on the outcome of events reported by the reality.eth oracle.

We can chose the most Nounish or pleasing pieces that work in the layout (would love a list and images ASAP if community wants to weigh in)\n\n\n2B: Production\nCost estimate $13-17 USD per unit packaged as a final product\nSRP: $20-22 wholesale, $40-45 retail \n\nThe goal of these is to distribute as many as possible so these can be allocated as giveaways to shows and events or sold at a wholesale price giving the event an opportunity to make money.\n\nSample first order breakdown:\n\n5000 pcs Incl. 500 GOLD NOUNDER GIFTS:\n3000 red \n1000 blue \n500 TBD (Pink ???)\n500 BLACK \n500 CHROME GOLD -exclusive to NOUN holders and only available through our gated shop\n\nIF Noun Holders want one of each  of any exclusives we need to consider additional orders\n\nBest to make first order as large as possible to cover any events during the next 6 months to 1 year \n\nImportant to consider the Nounish community needs for these Funglasses in the initial order so that there is enough stock on hand to satisfy any and all proposed promotional efforts.\n \n2C: Logistics and shipping\n \nAir shipping for samples and any show exclusives\nSea shipping for mass production\nAll items shipped to our 3PL warehouse in the USA for warehousing & fulfillment.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, Bigshot will act as a custodian for the physical glasses products and continue to develop new colors and possible tie-ins with other brands.\n\n\n\n\n\n2D: Maintaining stock & availability in USA\n\nBigshot will maintain a public-facing web shop with stock. We will make quantities of glasses available to Nouns at the discretion of the DAO for events and promotions and any other purpose. Will allocate specified quantities to Noun holders through our gated web store at no cost.\n\nShould there be event planning for future activities where we would need to manufacture exclusive products in special colors or packaging, or larger quantities, we need about 4-6 months notice at least. Air shipping is always available to expedite delivery but that is much more expensive than slow sea shipping.\n\nNeed to create web content for any scans of QR codes or Box scans to launch interactive elements like 3D AR Nouns or animated 3D Nouns.\n \nNounish community benefit: each Noun holder or friend /family could claim 5 free sets of glasses + shipping and handling worldwide (for example). If there are 300 Noun holders, and each holder gets 5 free glasses, then we need to plan for US stock to be depleted by 1500 units right away.\n\nThe rest of the stock will be available in the shop at a $40 USD retail but allocated to the various events and promotions as needed at a wholesale of $20 each. \n\n\n\n\n\n2E: Sundries associated with creating and selling physical goods\n\nWe would need to purchase LIABILITY INSURANCE\nCost estimate: $6-8K per year (or ETH equivalent)\n\nIn all instances, when paying for physical goods projects in ETH, we need to address the volatility of ETH. We would need to convert all ETH payments into fiat immediately in order to pay vendors like factories, warehouse, logistics companies etc.\n\nSuggestion to establish quarterly payment to maintain all of the parts moving.  Warehouse, logistics/production manager etc\n\n2F: Global Community Engagement Strategies\n\nPromoting Noun glasses & increasing visibility of the brand. Some of our ideas include:\n\nToy & pop culture conventions around the world (UK toycon/DCON, TTS, Wonder festival Design Fiesta, Shanghai toy show, beijing toy show etc)\nNFT-related meetups & events\nSports events Pro and college level - Funglasses giveaways at stadiums\nPromotional tie-ins e.g. Bud Light? \nCommercial use / brand use of the products Custom glasses frames with unique packaging similar to Bearbricks\nArt shows and events like a space at ART Basel (wynwood walls or SCOPE) , a DesignerCon takeover, a booth at NYCC, etc\nActive social media placements through targeted giveaways and event appearances documented on social media \nDCON TAKEOVER (NOUN-A-PALOOZA) with a 20x30 or larger booth experience with DJs, live art and activities  (papercraft, coloring books. DIY glasses projects etc) - featuring all of the current & upcoming Nounish projects sponsored by the DAO presented as a case study for what is possible with Nouns and more.\n5000 sets of glasses insert into the VIP bags at Dcon\nA NOUNTOWN in a metaverse, a place to hold events, art shows etc. DECENTRALLAND or?\nWe could use Funglasses in an onboarding package for new community members, both Nouners and newbs. - can have QR codes to easily disseminate info about the Nouns community and what is available to community members - answering the questions who, what and why?\nInfluencer mailers\n\n\nTiming of New Production Projects:\nAny Funglasses needs / events that the community decides upon that would overrun our available inventory in the USA warehouse would have to be communicated to us within a timeframe that allows us to quote on, produce and ship the required goods. Both air and sea shipping are extremely expensive these days, so a lot of advance planning is required for bigger production projects (ideally 4 months advance notice, can be cut to 3 months if we do air shipping).\nCost estimate: TBD\n\nOne way to avoid long production delays is to initially produce an overage of thousands of pairs of glasses in the main colors and store them in our USA warehouse so we have an abundance of stock to ship out as needed.\n\nWarehousing extra units has a cost - our warehousing partner charges by square foot. So we would need to estimate monthly cost of keeping the inventory based on how many units we keep on hand and how long we intend to store them.\nCost estimate: TBD\n\n\n\n\nDue to fluctuating ETH value and the fact that we need to immediately convert ETH into fiat to send to factory, we need to calculate each of the above payments right before it is due.\n\n \nLETS GO!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF COSTS:\n\nOVERALL FUNGLASSES ESTIMATED PROJECT COSTS\n(not including marketing / community engagement)\n\nTooling: 10 ETH *Note Small Grants is giving 5E to get this going now\nProduction @ 5K units: 26 ETH\nShipping / logistics estimate: 5 ETH\nWarehousing for 1 year: 4 ETH\nLiability insurance for 1 year: 3 ETH\n\nTOTAL ESTIMATE: 48-55 ETH (approx 0.01 ETH per unit)\n\nExpenses for a 2nd order would be lower per unit due to the elimination of the one time costs.\nSIMPLE PAYMENT BREAKDOWN:\n\nSharkDAO & Bigshot Multi-Sig -    0x6C3A3374f1250597431d4ead59C35FBadf132b40\n\n#1 tooling payment due ASAP to begin - 10 ETH (project is ready to go - there is a 35-45 day process between initial payment to test shots stage)\n#2 - 30 days later - production deposit payment 50% of whatever production ends up being\n(There may be minimal fluctuations in costs due to the deluxe packaging) \n#3 - 45 days  later - final balance production due\n#4 - 30 days later logistics - costs determined at time of payment due\n\nStill trying to figure out the final cost/process etc on the small details as it is pretty involved and needs to be developed for this and future projects. \n\n"},{"blockNumber":14580344,"blockHash":"0x74c706465a93a3c134c3fe13eb7244b2a9e963b4a9b6d6331ef49dad07449f58","transactionIndex":170,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x6d99346b24eb1a41bf66d6043e31dcdd893c488c42043534b64e1890dedf2447","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":57,"proposer":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","targets":["0x0B3CF56E7dF3BB3Fb7201fFcD96d279b05DDd2E3"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":14593484,"endBlock":14613194,"description":"# Bring luxury Noun sunglasses to market\n\n## Summary\n\nA couple months ago small grants funded the prototyping of a luxury sunglass initiative by salvinoarmati: https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grant-request-create-luxury-noun-sunglasses-irl/658.

Each NFT is *consumable* in the sense that it can be used *once* to redeem a physical pair. Once the NFT is used, a boolean value is flipped to indicate consumed status and the underlying tokenURI is permanently changed. A physical pair of sunglasses is then sent to you.\n\n**~7.2% of supply reserved for NounsDAO Treasury**\n\nThe total supply of the collection will be 6969 units. This project would not have been possible without the NounsDAO and the treasury.  As a thank you, we’ve decided to allocate ~7.2% of the supply to the treasury (500 units). We hope to make other such contributions as a thank you to the DAO in the future. \n\n**Custom Edition Glasses Just For Noun holders**\n\nWe’re also making a custom “special edition” pair *exclusively* for noun owners. The design of these glasses will be based off of the under-appreciated and rare “disco” glasses featured on some nouns. *There will only 500 of these glasses ever made, and will be available to the first 500 nouns during mint.

It is an NFT collection of 18 toadz with 100% of the funds being donated to Ukraine via Unchain Ukraine. A special bidding mechanic encourages people to donate more.\n\nThe gamified aspect is that you can not only mint toadz, but also transfer someone else’s toad in your wallet by matching or increasing their last donation. The toad then drops its noun glasses as POAP in the wallet of the original holder.\n\nThis mechanism is coded directly in the smart contract and a toad owner cannot prevent the toad from hopping into another wallet. This encourages people to donate more - if they want to keep their toad they need to increase the price of the donation or acquire back the toad if somebody donated more.\n\n100% of the funds are immediately sent from the Rescue Toadz smart contract to Unchain Ukraine. It is a pure charity project - the project devs make no money from it.\n\n## Why not donate directly to Unchain?\nThe idea is not only for Nouns DAO to donate, but also to encourage other people to donate as well. For example, NounsDAO will donate for already minted toadz and “steal” them from the previous owners. Some of them will then donate again to get their toad back.\n\nThe goal of the proposal is to donate 0.2 ETH for 5 toadz that are already minted and “steal” them from the previous owners and also raise the prices for two other toadz to 10 ETH and 40 ETH respectively.\n\n## Conclusion\nDonating 51 ETH through the Rescue Toadz project has the following benefits:\n\nFunds raised by NounsDAO to help Ukrainian people recover from the war\nRaised popularity of the Rescue Toadz charity project, so more people start donating\nPeople that had their Rescue Toad taken from them are incentivized to get it back by donating again.\nRecue Toadz or Noun Glasses NFTs collected by the NounsDAO\nRaised popularity of the iconic Nouns Glasses, which are dropped as POAP for everybody that participated"},{"blockNumber":14609470,"blockHash":"0x2c7a313ab75e5c5402e1af555618fc5ca9e82e7a0adf584d81c97b26a7a6f4f0","transactionIndex":271,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x3d26f2bf96b3e5b1058f176541d1ab156a2d926767897e1fb509cad9e5c00742","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":60,"proposer":"0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87fF6034fc032D4722","targets":["0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":14622610,"endBlock":14642320,"description":"# Test Foundation's Ability to Veto a Proposal During Timelock\n\nCan they do it?\n\nOnly time will tell...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/shorts/JWfULMcFikI"},{"blockNumber":14610303,"blockHash":"0xa4189ae273938c05857c499d7568e07586373a0822b6af823a7b2c358f54273a","transactionIndex":147,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x263482ce7761dd2cd169cd209290f1942abb9c5d377c6a5cfda642219b2b821b","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":61,"proposer":"0x353224270c2C9a7eCcE7d8dBA98a61587da6F50a","targets":["0xb809f32CfE33F3CcA0bbfdf8f56041c081138bb3"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":14623443,"endBlock":14643153,"description":"# Residency for cdt.eth\n\nHey all, my name is Christian.

I’m requesting 214 ETH (120 funding props / 94 opex) to continue to explore the Prop House model as a way to scale capital deployment over the next 4 months. \n\n### What has  happened since [Prop 23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23):\n- Built [prop.house](https://prop.house) \n- Funded 9 proposals for a total of 15 ETH\n- Received 69 proposals over two funding rounds (third round kicked off 4/13)\n- Opened dialogue with extension communities to onboard into Prop House, holding conversations with leaders and community members to understand their footing.\n- Gained 1,000+ followers on the Prop House twitter account\n- [Expense report](https://airtable.com/shr5UPKk4jyhveIDd)\n\n### Reflections:\n\n**Quality proposals**\nThe two core hypotheses with initial testing were that 1) there would be a meaningful volume of proposals given the ETH<>Proposal auction format and 2) some subset of proposals would be high quality. With 69 proposals and a double digit % of those being highly desirable, I feel confident that we should continue to pursue scale via the prop house model.\n\n**Communities are eager to participate**\nWith a total of 48 proposals and 520 votes casted by 77 non-nouners for Round 1, it’s clear that members of the broader community, both individually and as part of extension communities, are eager to participate. It’s behavior like this that points to how NFT communities can grow beyond their ownership-constrained communities (particularly true for Nouns).\n\n**DAO-only voting won't scale**\nGiven the volume of proposals received in Funding Round 1, it's clear that a Prop House where only Nouners are voting won't enable us to scale to 1000s of proposals. i.e. It's irrational to expect Nouners to be reading through 50 proposals every week. If we are to hit scale, decision making needs to be gradually decentralized. \n\n### Beyond funding - a new way to interact:\nFraming the ERC721 standard as the social graph, Prop House may be looked at as a “permissionless ETH power source that communities gather around” (h/t joel).\n\nAnalogous to reddit, we now have crypto-native subreddits but are missing the key ingredient that makes crypto so special - the ability to transact, transform and create value. \n\n**With this proposal**, Prop House looks to do two things:\n1) Focus development on the Nouns Prop House as the main node in the network:\n    - Nail down UX \n    - Experiment with different funding amounts, longer and shorter rounds \n3) Explore the ways in which the DAO can further its reach via independent Prop Houses (e.g. prop.house/**japan**, /**extensions**, /**budlight**)\n    - Enable these communities to become self-curating Prop Houses where their members both submit and vote on their own proposals.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kQ1JnVC.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/le4Q4Xz.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ElCNZge.png)\n\n\n### Team:\n- seneca (all hats)\n- devcarrot (backend)\n- toastee (design)\n- cdt (frontend)\n- jckbutcher (memes)\n\n### Budget:\n\nWe are requesting working + funding capital for **4 months** of operations. \n\n- Funding props, 120 ETH:\n    - 80 ETH for Nouns Prop House\n    - 40 ETH for 1-3 Nouns extensions Prop Houses (e.g. japan, nounpunks, budlight)\n- Operational, 94 ETH:\n    - 23.5 ETH per month:\n        - 10 ETH seneca \n        - 3.5 ETH devcarrot\n        - 3.5 ETH toastee\n        - 3.5 ETH jckbutcher\n        - 3 ETH for other potential misc expenses \n\n**Considerations**\n- Funding schedule is meant to be flexible so that we can both experiment (diff funding amounts) and slowly ramp up (i.e. start with 1 extension prop house)\n- Funding amounts and corresponding communities will be decided internally by the Prop House team. Some of the heuristics we are using to select communities:\n    - Enough activity to merit competition between proposals\n    - Willingness to onboard from leadership\n    - Alignment with nounish culture and proliferation\n- The ideal and final version of Prop House would allow for all decisions with regards to funds leaving the DAO to be decided upon by Nouners via vote. \n\n**Multi-sig**\nThe [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5BcD6f3B0a5519D448FBDf33204091bbE097C992) is currently 2/3 where the signers are seneca, devcarrot and toastee. It still holds ~20 ETH from [prop 23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23). With the passing of this proposal, we will be adding 2 more signers (cdt and jckbutcher). The addresses are as follows:\n- safe: 0x5BcD6f3B0a5519D448FBDf33204091bbE097C992\n- seneca: 0xfC9e8dB5E255439F430e058462360Dd52b87cB4f\n- devcarrot: 0xB1C41C71d36cedEa7DdCd5f8D5c5C32BA8f3CBFc\n- toastee: 0x5F99FC2d2A98e046t9689d3117e0F96bb5c640d88\n- cdt: 0xD19BF5F0B785c6f1F6228C72A8A31C9f383a49c4\n- jckbutcher: 0xD1295FcBAf56BF1a6DFF3e1DF7e437f987f6feCa\n\n\n### Closing thoughts\nProp 23 enabled the first experiment of the Prop House model. Given the results, it seems to me that the answer to \"is there something here?\" was a resounding yes. Moving forward, I hope to continue to build with the same framing: an exploration to see what the model can amount to.\n\nFor this next phase, there are a few key questions that I'd like to have more definitive answers to, chief among them: \n- Is the volume of quality proposals meaningful?\n- Will funding align extension/external communities to proliferate Nouns? \n- Is the Prop House model a viable approach to pursue 100x growth? \n\nThe goal of this proposal is to answer these questions by continuing to develop the UX while taking our first steps towards independent Prop Houses.\n\nIf this second phase succceeds, I intend to eventually  develop Prop House into an trustless on-chain solution. As stated in [Prop 23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23):\n> Conceptually, the contracts could be the seed to a crypto native Y Combinator model. Where as before you had partners, now you have DAO members. Instead of summer and winter batches, you have weekly or monthly cadences. And instead of demographic restrictions for applicants, you have anyone with an Ethereum wallet. It might be the case that breaking thresholds in the categories mentioned above transforms the model to something completely different.\n\nFrom lessons learned in the first phase, I'd reframe it by saying that utilizing only DAO members won't scale. Instead, plugging into open and available social graphs (ERC721) is the way."},{"blockNumber":14631905,"blockHash":"0x5f860fa456a963ec89f6d439c61dbca95015625c5a422a73af59b18e5f8db74b","transactionIndex":160,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xcc810ab8123b90c7cc9a9d28a1b166938eaeef7b0b5d120df8ce9a295c50cbe2","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":63,"proposer":"0x880f450841e67C786aD3b0b3644b26D2680B7c8c","targets":["0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":14645045,"endBlock":14664755,"description":"# Pilot Collectivized Nounish Allocation \n\n **Purpose**\n \n Equip Builders to Steward DAO Resources\n \n **Ask**\n \n100 Ξ\n\n**Covenant (tl;dr)**\n\nAny Noun (\"Nouner\") or member of the Nouns Discord server and given the \"Nouncillor\" role (http://discord.gg/nouns) will be eligible to co-administer distribution of Ask in an experimental effort to democratize funding by and of protocol (NounsDAO) contributors. The objective for this round will be to empower the collective of active Nouns builders to convey Ξ in a manner that attempts to effect sustained outsize benefit to Nounish Culture.\n\n**Procedure** \n1.

Number of nominated contributors is too low or too high to be deemed a useful representation of active Nouns builders.\n3.

The projects and builders that the treasury funds are what is nounish. The substance of the proposals are the most compelling and accessible narratives of Nouns DAO. These stories will also attract more builders to submit proposals to the protocol.\n- **Let the builders focus on building**\n    - Builders don’t have to be marketing experts.\n    - We want to enable builders to focus on delivering their projects in the best way - and let us produce the video marketing assets they need.\n    - We hope that potential builders who see these videos will get inspired to create quality proposals themselves, knowing that this support and exposure will be there.\n- **Use the treasury to its fullest potential**\n    - An awesome Nouns-funded project that not many know about is a waste of our treasury.\n    - We will make sure to amplify the work that’s being done by our prop builders and reach a wide audience.\n- **CC0 Nouns Video Stock**\n    - Similar to public domain stock videos, all footage that we will gather in the process of producing these videos will be CC0 and available online\n        - Initially we will share a Google Drive or Dropbox with these files. We will also experiment with posting the footage in CC0 stock video websites like [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).\n        - In the future, if there’s demand, we may want to build a dedicated website to enable easy access to the footage.\n    - This will enable the composability of our storytelling by giving access to right-free footage to, for example:\n        - Projects like the [Rose Parade documentary](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-go-to-the-rose-parade-a-documentary-by-the-makers-of-robot-chicken/1046) will be able to use our raw footage as part of their documentary, permissionlessly.\n        - YouTubers who produce an explainer video about Nouns.\n        - News outlets who are reporting about Nouns.\n        - All future documentaries about the protocol.\n    - This will enable more “memetic stimulus”: more visual content from our projects can result in more nounish memes!\n\n**Scope of The Pilot**\n\nWe want to start with a small pilot of 4 published videos, delivered within the next few months. These videos will be 30-90 seconds, bite sized content for easy consumption and maximum shareability. They will focus on summarizing a single project/proposal – with a little context about nouns as well.\n\nIn this pilot we want to experiment and learn as much as possible (e.g. How to work best with builders? What content type and format gets the most engagement? How do we manage remote film crews?).  Once we successfully deliver on the pilot and we have learned a ton, we will probably submit another proposal to produce more videos.\n\n- Work with builders to create videos telling the stories of 4 projects:\n    - Confirmed:\n        - Coloring Books by Messhup\n    - Other projects we would love to work with but haven’t fully confirmed yet:\n        - Nouns Psychogeography Sculpture with Dustin Yellin\n        - Perpetual Glasses to Kids In Need\n        - TSP x Nouns: Skateboard Design and Giveaway\n        - Luxury Noun Sunglasses\n        - Hong Kong Takeover\n        - Nouns 3D-printed fashion collection\n- Upload all relevant high quality raw footage to a cloud service and make it available to anyone.\n- Setup, brand, and manage new social accounts for Nounish on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok & YouTube\n- Share videos to social media accounts\n\n**Team**\n\n**[142](https://twitter.com/danpeguine)**\n\n- Strategy, scriptwriting, and storytelling\n- Coordinating with builders\n- Manage socials\n\n**[Goldy](https://twitter.com/Goldypix) & [Pixel](https://www.pixel.melbourne/)**\n\n- Strategy, scriptwriting, and storytelling\n- All video production: from footage to edited files, film crews\n- Visual brand assets\n\n**Questions or comments?

External contributors and Nouners who helped set up Nouncil up will be invited to join the circle as potential recipients. Q1 Coordinape will be administered immediately. We will prepare a report of how the operating costs were distributed and host it on the Nouncil website publicly.\n\nProgram specific operating costs will be distributed in separate Coordinape rounds with the teams that worked on them.\n\nCurrently Nouns DAO proposal discussion on Discord and Discourse is encouraged, but still considered a volunteer activity.

The grant is permissionless, any eligible Nouncillor will receive it if they apply. It must be spent proliferating Nouns in the most effective way possible. Nouncillors may choose to delegate their grant to another Nouncillor. Funds that are unable to be spent effectively within the period will be sent back to Nouns DAO.\n\nNouncil will establish basic guidelines and rules on how these grants can be spent, but will leave a lot open to imagination. Projects should be highly aligned with Nouns DAO and celebrate both Nouns and Nounish culture.

They host the single largest prize pool tournament in esports, The International. The latest purse for this annual tournament was around $40 million USD. To qualify for The International, you participate in the Dota Professional Circuit (DPC) 2 league which takes place throughout the year. This is mostly an online, regional format, but each season culminates in an international LAN called a Major.\n\nOne of the first initiatives of our esports pod will be to sign “4 Zoomers” 3, a Division 1 North American DPC team.\n\n**Budget: 35 ETH**\n\nThe majority of this budget will be used to compensate the roster of five players, their manager and coach for the upcoming DPC season. The team has agreed to sign from the day the proposal is voted-in until the end of the third DPC season, July 17.\n\nWe will be working with former player and caster Brax to to act as an ambassador and liaison within the Dota community.

This way we ensure an inter-regional promotion of NFTs in the two biggest Cities of Bavaria (total population of ~2M people)\n\n**The first day** introduces the underlying technologies of NFTs such as blockchain and smart contracts through panels and talks. Different areas of application of NFTs and their economic significance will be presented using successful examples from the gaming, fashion and art sectors. A panel discussion will be held to critically examine the technology and its benefits and to take a visionary look into the future of NFTs. On this day, the audience will be introduced to the world of NFTs and informed about the basics and possible areas of application.\n\n**The second day** will be a deep dive into current topics and trends in Web3 and the world of NFTs. Representatives from Web3 projects and companies will present their NFT journey, current strategies and experiences. Trends, technological developments, as well as tax and regulatory aspects will be covered. The crypto and NFT communities and all interested parties are invited to exchange ideas in an interdisciplinary manner on this day.\n\nThe event is planned to attract ~400 people in-person and around the same amount to stream online over the course of 2 days.\n\n# who is organising muc.xyz?\n[Benjabo](https://twitter.com/benjabo): Benjamin Bauer (CEO of [ZOLLHOF](https://www.zollhof.de/) - Tech Incubator) is a long-time fan of blockchain technology.

We are sure this event will draw attention to NFTs and blockchain because it is touching the Zeitgeist and there are not many other events to educate the public about this technology in Germany, and so far none in Munich.\n\n**There is still a great need for education and information in Germany.**  **There are a few events, but they differ in their objectives and focus.** \n**So far there are not many events to compare it even with.**\n\nRight now it is a right and important time for our muc.xyz, precisely because there are so many different approaches, ideas, areas of application etc… **Our approach also stands out above all because of the first day, which focuses on critical observation and informing the broader public.**  On top of it, Bavaria has developed its own blockchain strategy. The added value of this technology for society, the economy and even for the administration is seen.\n\nMunich is a hotspot for art! The art scene is alive and well. There are many collectors and art enthusiasts here. There is a lot of “old” culture and a lot of tradition.

We expect these to be illustrated and 20+ pages each.\n\nThe multi-sig would pay the writers on a schedule of 30% Up Front, 20% Upon Rough Draft, 50% Upon Completion.

For this I am proposing a compensation of 6ETH/month for trial period of 3 months.\n\nAs a creative manager by trade I have experience helping creatives deliver while holding them to high standards and helping with ideas.

All the raw footage, music and artwork to be added to the Marketing Studio free resource of CC0 assets.\n\n**FUTURE / NEXT STEPS**\nAs we researched the web3 space here in New Zealand for an ongoing feature-length documentary, we found a group of very talented artists connected through NFTs and their own DAO. The Wenbreakfast DAO.\n\nSo, our next plan is to start a series of spin-offs for a streaming platform. One episode per artist in the Wenbreakfast DAO.\n\nWe hope the artists will wish to join Nouns DAO after watching Dean’s film and going through the experience of being the next talent portrayed in our documentary series.\n\n**MORE ABOUT DEAN**\nAmong other things, he is hosting pixel arts lessons on twitch for the Noun Cats community.\n\nA firm believer in the power of web3, not only he is working full-time on his project with backseats, but he is also building yet another extension, Early Birbs, with his Discord community.\n\nDuring the live sessions, the PFP traits are created with the audience, in real-time.\n\nDean is paying it forward by teaching others the art and technique that transformed his life.\n\n**BUDGET: 12 ETH**\n\nPre-production and research\nProduction: 3 days of shooting in Nelson, NZ with a 5 people team\nPost-production: Editing / Graphics / Grading and online / Audio Mix\nOriginal soundtrack\nROADMAP / TIMELINE\n\n2 months from funding to online/final cut delivered\nTEAM\n\n[Leo Clark](https://twitter.com/leoclark) Discord: leoclark.eth ⌐◨-◨#2267\n[Filmmaker obsessed with NFTs and Nouns evangelist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leoclarkribeiro/)\n\n[Neil Stichbury](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-stichbury-6374794/)\nDirector/producer with over 20 years of experience in factual and commercials.\n\n[Jacob Bryant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-bryant-4144b01a/)\nDP.

The Noun community has shown itself to be forward thinking, enterprising, generous, warm, funny and bold. Everything from donating to Ukraine, making eye glasses for the underprivileged, to being featured in a Super Bowl ad. This is a story worth telling!\n\nThis project will be unique for three reasons:\n\n1. Stoopid Buddy has spent years developing a very specific comedic tone we want to bring to this documentary. The doc will tell the story of the Nouns community and all the amazing initiatives it supports, but will be anchored with a strong narrative - the journey of getting the Nouns into the Rose Parade as the first ever NFT featured. This narrative lends itself to keeping things fun, silly and strange, while providing a strong hook to tether the larger story of Nouns.\n2. As part of the documentary story, we'll be building and featuring six life-size walk around Noun costumes that will spread the Noun ethos through activities the community will have a say in driving. Do we want them handing out glasses? Giving random hugs to people in Times Square? Running in a charitable half marathon? We'll have fun and create great content for the documentary, all while showcasing how the DAO works.\n3. Our story will revolve around the journey to get a giant, vibrant Noun float in the Pasadena Rose Parade in 2023. The film will reach a climactic end with the six life size Nouns partying their way down the Rose Parade with a massive Noun float in tow!\n\n_Tone_\n\nWe're inspired by docs like \"Exit Through the Gift Shop\" which was light, playful, and blurred the line between real and imagined. We want to tell this story in an imaginative way, often with tongue firmly in cheek.\n\n_Why?_\n\nWe are inspired by this community and think the world needs to know how amazing and revolutionary this DAO is. We also think this is a great way to get this organization and brand out to a much wider audience. The Rose Parade will create tens of millions of impressions but the documentary will give this story life and legs and tee up the Nouns to further their reach into mainstream pop culture.\n\n_Who are we?_\n\nWe are [Stoopid Buddy Stoodios](https://www.leagueofbuddies.com/). Most of you might know us from our flagship series, [Robot Chicken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuWZzOusVJ8), but we're also the studio behind Marvel's MODOK, Crossing Swords on Hulu, and all the costumes on FOX's [Masked Singer](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/the_masked_singer-characters-publicity-split-h_2019.jpg). And the studio that built a 15 foot walk around for [League of Legends](https://www.leagueofbuddies.com/news/buddy-builds-at-pax-east/). We've been nominated for over [22 Emmys](https://www.emmys.com/shows/robot-chicken) and won six of them. We've also won Cleo Awards for our advertising work and have worked with brands from DC, Marvel, Walking Dead, Star Wars, LEGO, Target, and [Denny's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBLThhKIoFM) among many others. All that is to say we know how to translate the spirit of a brand into entertainment. We're also the studio that last year built a life-size walk around goat Noun that made [an appearance at NFT.NYC](https://twitter.com/grelysian/status/1456665812182487048). While our ambition for the next round of life size Nouns is even greater, this experience was amazing, and a source of inspiration for what's to come.\n\nBut we don't want to do this alone. We want to bring the entire Nouns community together to help tell this story. We've been amazed by the early positive support of this proposal and are excited to engage with you all. Nouners will have the opportunity to participate by voting on where these life size \"Nouns in the Wild\" go on their journey, and even participate by walking along with other Nouns in the actual Rose Parade. The documentary will feature interviews with Nounders and Nouners alike, and highlight projects that have been successfully funded and what type of impact they've made. This will be a movie making experience that engages the entire community.\n\n### BENEFITS TO THE NOUNS DAO\n\n\nROSE PARADE\n- HUGE AWARENESS OPPORTUNITY TO TELL THE NOUN STORY\n_(all data below provided by the Tournament of Roses staff)_\n  - Rose Parade seen by 22 million people in the US, and in over 60+ countries across the world\n  - 1,000,000 people line the streets in Pasadena for the parade, and another 150,000 visit the floats pre and post parade\n  - 1.8M+ social impressions\n  - 20 seconds of airtime during telecast with scripted description for Nouns\n  - Inclusion of the float in printed program\n  - Estimated media value of media coverage $300M\n\n\nDOCUMENTARY\n- First documentary about a DAO community to fully tell the Nouns story and cement their place in public imagination, but in a way that's funny and on-brand for both the Nouns and Stoopid Buddy Stoodios.\n- The Nouns community will vote on random acts of joy that our Nouns will spread throughout real world communities as part of our documentary so we can highlight other initiatives the DAO funds and feature other Nounish events.\n- Sequels and other content opportunities to expand on the story we tell in the documentary. Our plan is to take any net proceeds from the sale of the documentary and reinvest them into more Nouns content.\n\n### PHASES OF EXECUTION\n\nPHASE 1: (May-July)\n\n- Select and design the six life-size Nouns\n- Sign contract with the Rose Parade team for 2023\n  - (NOTE: Document each of these phases with our production team)\n- Line up interviews and identity storylines for the documentary (those that would like to remain anonymous will be free to do so)\n- **MILESTONE 1 - Fund 45% of proposed allocation\\***\n\nPHASE 2 (July-September 2022)\n\n- Begin building out the Noun costumes for the documentary and the parade\n- Begin the designs that will ultimately become the massive Rose Parade float\n\nPHASE 3 (August-September)\n\n- Community votes on winning float design\n- Approve the build\n- **MILESTONE 2 - Fund 45% of proposed allocation\\***\n\nPHASE 4 (September 2022-January 2023)\n\n- Film interviews and storylines for the documentary including the \"Nouns in the wild\" segments\n- Film behind the scenes of the parade build and the day of festivities.\n- Release short segments of the film to build awareness and hype for the parade.\n\nPHASE 5 (January-Feb 2023)\n\n- Party at the Rose Parade!\n- Post-Production and editorial cut\n- Screen film exclusively to the Nouns community for feedback on final cut\n- Determine best distribution outlets for the film\n- **MILESTONE 3 - Fund final 10% of proposed allocation\\***\n\nPHASE 6 (Q2/3 2023)\n- Distribution. Our objective is to maximize viewership with wide distribution. Tactics may include submitting to festivals, pitching to streamers and networks (SVOD), or even distributing on AVOD services like YouTube to keep from being behind paywall. We'll make this decision with transparency and will confer with Nouns DAO as we consider options.\n\n_\\* Milestones to be funded at commencement of each phase.

Mr Andrew Muiruri, the lead driver, who started his career under the FIA young stars and his co-driver Mr.Edward, one of the most experienced rally drivers in the Southern hemisphere, boasting over 51 podium finishes over a period of over 10 years ,by sponsoring them with 3 stock cars for modification,and to get them registration to be able to participate in the World Rally Championship.*\n\n[![Fia](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/044a29041eb3f76db7e423bd85fc93b1c9823b00.jpeg)](https://www.fia.com/events/world-rally-championship/season-2022/2022-world-rally-championship)\n\n# Proposal\n*I am proposing that my racing team partner with the Nouns in the World Rally Championship Safari Rally that is scheduled for the 24th of June.

The same event last year generated 832 million impressions world-wide, from streaming sites(Red Bull TV, WRC+).*\n\n*•Nounified branding of team race cars and gear.\n•Registration costs paid to the WRC.\n•Servicing the cars to the performance and safety standards required by FIA.\n•Multiple ad work and promotion during and before the event.\n•Mechanical and car service.\n•Filming personnel.\n•Travel and accommodation expenses for the racing team\nEvent Mechanics personnel.\n•Spare parts.*\n\n\n[![Stephan.L of Citroen wrecked his rally car in Poland, which his mechanics fixed completely in less than 30 min.](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/8a0a1dd79f8daa3ea56e95199a2f7bc6eeebb81f.jpeg)\n\n\n## Media & Coverage\n*The event will be broadcasted on more than 30 live sports channels in over 50 countries all over the world. The Kenyan leg of the rally garnered 832 million impressions, putting up higher numbers than the Super Bowl and the Champions League. Streaming services such as Red Bull TV and WRC+ will also stream the event live.*\n\n## WRC Rally Car\n*WRC Rally cars are built to the standards stipulated in the FIA WRC Sporting Regulations Handbook. All participating Rally Cars are inspected by FIA, the governing body,to make sure they are up to safety and performance standards to the letter.*\n\n*Like all competition cars, a rally car features a roll cage, upgraded suspension and a strong braking system. In order to pound rough roads at high speeds, however, they require sturdier parts.\nBeefier engine mounts ensure the block won’t shake loose on bumpier road sections, while a thick aluminium skid plate prevents sharp rocks from lacerating an otherwise vulnerable oil pan. Meanwhile, bespoke wheels and tyres are essential for dealing with varied, challenging terrain.*\n\n*Today’s WRC cars are built to the specification set by the international motorsports governing body the FIA.In 2011, rules for WRC cars became more restrictive. Cars were smaller models and exotic materials such as titanium, magnesium and composite were forbidden expect when present in the base model. Initially, gear changes had to be made with a mechanical system, so the use of paddle shifters was not allowed, however this was reversed in 2015.*\n\n*In 2017, manufacturers were given more freedom to maximise aerodynamic performance, while the turbo restrictor diameter was increased from 33 mm to 36 mm, increasing the engine’s power output from 310 bhp to 380 bhp.*\n\n\n## Promotion and Nounified Onsite Clothing & Accessories\n*During the course of the Rally all members of Team Nouns will be donning some form of nounified apparel. The Rally driver’s and their co-drivers, the mechanics and the engineers (Service team) will wear noun safari hats or baseball hats to shield themselves from the scorching African sun.\nThe team will also be supplied with nounified towels to use after completing each leg.

Nerman can also be a great friend. A shoulder to cry on. A guiding light.\n\nIn Discord he will help with coordinating group votes on DAO proposals (ie Nouncil), informal Nouner polling, offer helpful commands, post all relevant Nouns DAO activity, and allow the community to easily share content to Social Media. On Twitter he will listen for Nounish content and cleverly decide what is the top content to reshare.\n\nNerman will be open source, and Nounish communities can clone him and tap into the Nouns protocol within their own Discords. Every subdao with a Nouns vote needs a Nerman. Every subdao with twitter needs a Nerman curating their feed.\n\n**DELIVERABLES**\nTwo Discord bots, a Twitter social listening bot, two websites, and a distribution ready open source library.\n\n**TIMELINE**\n6 Months (multiple collaborators)\n\n**BUDGET**\n\n69.420 ETH \n\n\n___\n\n# 1. PROPOSER: JOEL CARES\n___\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DTQjQzu.png)\n\nJoel has been building in Nouns since November. This projects coincides with him shifting into full time Nounish work, the beginning of many years of Joel x Nouns collaboration. Alongside (and separate from) this project he will be actively taking meetings in the entertainment / tech / comedy / animation worlds to spread the Nounish word and help groups put together proposals.\n\nSocials: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JoelCares_/) -  [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joelcares/) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/joelcares.net) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelcares/)\n\nJoel is:\n - a [Nounish Meme](https://twitter.com/JoelCares_/status/1520076489974190080)\n - a founding member of [Nouncil](https://twitter.com/nouncil)\n - the current elected Nouncil Ambassador to Nouns DAO\n - helping admin [Prop 63](https://nouns.wtf/vote/63)\n - building [Noggles.wtf](https://noggles.wtf/)\n - running [Crispy Nouns](https://twitter.com/CrispyNouns)\n - making 3D at [JoelCares.net](https://joelcares.net)\n - CEO of [ANOA.ca](https://anoa.ca/)\n - CEO of [Lobal Global](https://lobal.global/)\n\n___\n\n# 2. PREAMBLE\n___\n\nEarlier this year we received [support from Small Grants](https://lobalglobal.notion.site/Proposal-Nerman-1-0-f37a8407e49641a5b5f2d8f2c6ff334c) to develop Nerman 1.0 - a basic version of Nerman with social sharing and simple Discord commands. Nerman 1.0 is alive and well!\n\n- Currently running in private server\n- Manually retweeted and shared ~3000 Nounish posts as [NermanBot](https://twitter.com/nermanbot) \n- Curated 4 Twitter lists: [Nouners](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1495232888249491456), [Nouncillors](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1498451834545086470), [Nounish Projects](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1494410570161926147), [Nounish Content Mines](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1473482057246408707)\n\nTo showcase Nerman we released [Lil Nerman](https://twitter.com/LilNerman), a development bot currently running in NIL Discord.\n - will reshare Discord post content to  when :nerman: emoji used\n - has basic commands (/noun and /nouner)\n\nWe have also completed a first version of [Noun O'Clock bot](https://nounoclock.wtf/) that anyone can add. It is currently running in NIL and NounsDAO Japan.\n - shows time to Noun O'Clock in bot status\n - posts link to [FOMONouns.wtf](https://fomonouns.wtf) at Noun O'Clock \n\n___\n\n# 2. DISCORD BOT - NERMAN\n\n___\n\nThe Nerman Discord bot can help with internal governance and polling, sharing community news to the world, connecting people, lending a hand. A true friend.\n\n**2. A.) DISCORD - SIMPLE VOTING**\n\nNouncil / subdaos all use emoji polls to vote on Nouns DAO proposals. It's messy and a lot of work. Nerman can fix this.\n\n**Problems - Discord Emoji Polls**\n - people can vote for more than one option\n - if emoji votes are public, anybody can add reactions. Because of this you have to manually go through and manually tally results.\n - people can add unwanted emojis, cluttering the poll.\n - when the vote is finished you have to manually mark it closed and post the results.\n - the results aren't stored in a database, and there are no broad statistics calculated from them\n\n**Simple Voting - Features**\n\n - allow / disallow voting based on Discord roles (public, Nouner, Nouncillor...)\n - votes can be anonymous, or public. For anon votes participation will still be tracked but actual vote content won't be stored\n - can enforce one vote per user, or allow multiple\n - specify an end time\n - live visual feedback, which can be turned on or off\n - uses Discords new button API\n - stores votes in a database in preparation for future web apps that display voting stats\n - basic API for db queries so others can build with this data\n\n**FUTURE GOALS**\n - consider further voting methods: weighted voting, ranked choice, quadratic. Can any reliably be done from Discord?\n - manage and deploy votes from web app\n - create Snapshot vote and post to Discord\n - possibly automate executing Nouns DAO vote\n\n___\n\n**2. B.) DISCORD - SOCIAL SHARING**\n___\n\nNounish Discords are contain a stream of Nounish content, creators put their soul into noggley creations and the world needs to see it. Nerman can fix this.\n\nIn V1.0 we implemented basic social sharing, active in the NIL Discord and the [@LilNerman](https://twitter.com/lilnerman) account. \n\n**FEATURES - COMPLETED**\n - user reacts \"Nerman\" emoji, Nerman responds with \"NERMAN_BLAST\" \n - text & media (image, gif, video) are formatted appropriately for twitter\n - threshold function that determines how many votes needed to share\n\n**FEATURES - NEW**\n - better media handling, adding support for large videos and any other misc media that needs to be formatted and handled for Twitter\n - create Nerman social media accounts on other platforms (instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn). Format it appropriately and post it there as well\n - test thoroughly and improve error handling and messages\n - if user's post is just a tweet, allow Nerman to simply retweet\n - further develop Twitter thread functionality for long text posts\n - test the Threshold functionality with live public, tweak and dial in\n - experiment with Threshold calculations in an active Discord\n\n\n___\n\n **2. C.) DISCORD - COMMANDS**\n___\n\nSome people live in Discord.They live and breath Discord. They don't want to go on the *internet* to find Nounish facts and assets, they want it In-The-Chat. Nerman can... ah, whatever, you get it.\n\nV1.0 Nerman implemented the following commands using https://noun.pics\n\n**/noun [id]**\nReturned a PNG of the specified Noun in an ephemeral response.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HZ4GiRE.png)\n\n\n**/nouner [address or ENS]**\nReturned a grid showing the Nouns owned by that address.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vXxFXUs.png)\n\n\n**FEATURES - NEW**\nWe will switch to the Nouns DAO subgraph and offer more details.\n\n - /nerman noun [id]\nCan display a more detailed ephemeral message about the Noun. It could possibly include: a PNG image, the last sale price, current owner, basic DAO voting stats, other Nouns owned... we will try to express the most useful content in a minimal clean way.\n\n- /nerman nouner [address or ETH address] [include delegates]\nWe will change this to an ephemeral with more stats about that address, including owned Nouns and delegated Nouns. Possibly things like auctions won, etc.\n\n- Other Useful General commands\nWe’d like to add further useful commands as we think of them, while also not clogging up the Nouns command space. We will experiment!\n\n\n---\n\n  **2 D.) DISCORD - BOT MESSAGES**\n\n---\n\nNerman will be active in the Discord posting useful things about the State of Nouns, social media, and anything else he can chime in on.\n\n**FEATURES**\n\n - When a new Nouner !joins Nerman will provide a welcome package with all links and instructions required to enjoy their Nouns experience.\n - When someone wins an auction Nerman will look on ENS for connected Social Media accounts and try to tag them with a Warm Welcome when possible\n - All State of Nouns events will be available with nice formatting: new auction, bids, auction end, new DAO proposal, proposal executed, etc\n - Notifications whenever a Noun is transferred - if it occurs on a marketplace with an API (OpenSea, LooksRare, Zora) we will provide appropriate metadata like price\n - These notifications will be configurable - work with the commmunity to figure out which ones are useful, turn the rest off\n - top daily Twitter messages\n\n---\n\n  **2. E.) DISCORD - ADMIN CONFIG**\n\n---\n\nIn the beginning Nerman will only be allowed in approved Discords under the devs watchful eyes. We will tweak, and improve, and help Nerman be the best bot he can be.\n\nOnce Nerman is a well built, reliable bot, we will build out a simple config system for people to install and configure Nerman to run in any Discord and share to any social media accounts. \n\n**FEATURES**\n - configure which \"State of Nouns\" events post, and to which channel\n - configure which social media accounts Nerman posts too, including posting to your orgs own social media\n - where Nerman listens for posts to share to social media\n - turn options on and off (swear filter, welcome committee, etc)\n - customize messages things like the Noun O'Clock message\n - change language\n\n---\n\n  # 3. DISCORD BOT - NOUN O'CLOCK\n\n---\n\nNoun O'Clock bot is a very basic fork of Nerman that does two simple things:\n\n - Counts down to the next Noun O'Clock in the bot status:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/w7F9c0O.png)\n - At Noun O'Clock - posts a link to [FOMO Nouns](https://fomonouns.wtf/) in the designated channel:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/a0GLIjP.png)\n\nThis is currently running in several discords, including NounsDAO Japan and NIL. You can download and install the current version of Noun O'Clock here: https://nounoclock.wtf/\n\n**NEW FEATURES**\n - Integrate new State of Nouns libray\n - Add more details to announcement link, including an image of the sold Noun, sale price, and buyer address.\n\n\n---\n\n# 4. TWITTER BOT - NERMAN LISTENER\n\n___\n\nNerman surfs through social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instawhatever, etc), sharing, caring, looking for primo Nounish content to showcase. He is on a mission to automate his Twitter account. Nerman will try to figure out novel ways to find high quality Nounish content and decide which ones should be shared to [@NermanBot](https://twitter.com/nermanbot). This will take some experimentation, we have ideas but will be trying them out and continuously refining.\n\n\n**FEATURES**\n - Nerman will listen on Twitter @NermanBot tags. In the beginning he will retweet all of them, and when there are too many, will develop further metrics for choosing what to Tweet.\n - Nerman will listen for common Nounish content, like \"@nounsdao\", \"#nouns\", and \"⌐◨-◨\" and share the top results.\n - Nerman will share important events from the State of Nouns, including saying hello to New Nouners when an auction finishes, \n - Nerman will compare content from all methods and ensure only a reasonable amount of tweets are sent each day.\n - broadcast Nerman activity to additional social networks: Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn\n\nIf the DAO desires Nerman can eventually post directly to [@NounsDao](https://twitter.com/nounsdao).\n\n\n___\n\n# 5. WEBSITE - NERMAN.WTF\n\n___\n\nNerman will maintain a presence in the *old web* at https://nerman.wtf. There will be some fun, basic info about Nouns DAO, a guide to following Nerman and Nouns activity, and a web app that displays voting stats from Discord polls.\n\n**FEATURES**\n\n - a summary of Nerman and Nerman's activities\n - discord bot documentation\n - State of Nouns documentation\n - instructions on how to engage with Nerman on Twitter\n - links to all Nerman social media\n - breakdown of vote results and decisions made\n - breakdown of behaviour across all votes, including user behavior (if not anon) \n\n___\n\n# 6. WEBSITE - NOUNOCLOCK.WTF\n\n---\nNerman will maintain a very basic site for Noun O'Clock. It's already complete. \n[https://nounoclock.wtf/](https://)\n\n**FEATURES**\n - a website with stuff on it. Go look\n\n___\n\n# 7. JS LIBRARY - STATE OF NOUNS\n\n---\n\nWHEN DO THINGS HAPPEN?! Nerman needs to know, and so do other Nounish bots. When a Nouns auction ends, when a proposal is created, when a Noun sells on OpenSea. Nerman needs these events, and the data associated with them.\n\nState of Nouns is a standalone JS library for the Nounish community. Nerman will use it, and any other JS project can use it to accurately get events from all Nouns DAO activity.\n\nOur first priority is developing this fully for Nerman. Afterwards we will package and release it as an open source, free standalone library.\n\n\n**FEATURES**\n - provides access to all Nouns events across governance, NFTs, etc\n - will report all Noun transfers. Will report sale metadata if on OpenSea, LooksRare, or Zora\n - simple JS library that can be incorporated into other projects\n - user provides own Web3 connection details (supports various JSON-RPC options)\n - no centralized service, simply fork the code and run your own\n\n\n---\n\n# 8. USER ROLES & META DATA RESEARCH\n\n---\n\nDiscord user roles are often verified with Collab.Land. Nerman will be able to function with existing User roles. \n\nWe will experiment with other options in a separate Discord, try to find a better way. We have specific advanced Nerman functionality we want to explore. There are solutions like [The Guild](https://www.the-guild.dev/) and devcarrot's [custom idea](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/lets-build-a-better-way-to-verify-ownership/297). A simple connection to ENS would also be great.\n\n**FUNCTIONALITY RESEARCH GOALS**\n - connect Discord username -> wallet address -> Twitter username so we can correctly tag users on Twitter when sharing. This could be a custom app, or there might be existing tools we can use.\n - NOUNS: automating \"[Nouner](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1495232888249491456)\" Twitter list to automatically add new Nouners, and remove Nouners who sell their Noun\n - if people have ENS with twitter and Discord usernames added we can tag people live as the Nouns auction bids happen, and we could send winners nice welcome messages on Twitter and Discord.\n - We will publish our findings as a guide for other communities to follow\n\n\n___\n\n# 9. RECURRING COSTS\n\n___\n\n**HOSTING & MAINTENANCE**\n___\n**Discord Bots**\nNerman\nNoun O'Clock Bot\n\n**Twitter Bots**\nNerman Listener\n\n**Websites**\nNerman.wtf\nNounOClock.wtf\n\n**Code Libraries**\nState Of Nouns JS\n\nAll of these will need to be hosted and maintained over time. We will be in Discord and on Twitter paying attention to quality and listening to the community. We will publish the State of Nouns library on something like NPM, ensure it's accessible to devs, and answer questions from the community.\n\n___\n\n**SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGEMENT**\n___\n\nNerman has been active since January: https://twitter.com/NermanBot/\n\nThe account has been operated manually by Joel Cares for about 5 months now (almost 3000 RTs!) and involves scouring Twitter for content daily. We will continue this for 6 more months, until Nerman is ready to automate the content curation and take over the reigns.\n\nOnce Nerman Bot is live, we will still loosely moderate the feed to ensure quality is kept high and nothing Vile comes through.

Raise Nouns awareness and proliferation potential on a previously unrealized scale\n\n![Event Space](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/0/0d7ffadc9ee9fe961e06d937ecc2a31cf2273d46.jpeg \"Event Space\")\n\nThe DAO has already funded a Nouns expedition space and the ISS. This proposal will MAKE NOUNS VISIBLE FROM SPACE by installing a pair of Nouns glasses large enough that they’ll be seen from orbit and for long enough to be included when satellite maps are updated in Google Earth/Maps, etc. They’ll become part of the permanent record, visible even to normies that don’t frequent NFT social media. The glasses will appear less\nthan 300 yards from the largest stadium in the US (third largest in the world) and one of the largest universities — a destination for hundreds of thousands every year. It’s also an area that has undergone major municipal and private development over the past 12 months so updates to online maps are sure to follow.\n\nNouns funding will fulfill multiple goals simultaneously: the biggest and most visible being the massive Nouns glasses, obvious not only to online navigators but to in-person visitors and media providing ground & aerial coverage during sporting events. The glasses will be included as part of a synthetic turf upgrade at the site and will align with a North-oriented map display for a natural viewing angle. Replacing the natural lawn with\nsynthetic turf will improve durability at the site and preserve the Nouns glasses long enough for the next satellite maps update to take place.\n\nFunding will also serve as a retainer for Nouns IRL events in a Midwest US city accustomed to large gatherings and a short drive from an international air hub. The Nouns community is welcome at the charity beer garden and can also request a private visit. Nouns DAO will have access to a 10,000 square foot outdoor site and a\npremium residential venue for any dates not reserved for charity events).\n\nInstallation of the Nouns glasses at the site will identify Nouns DAO as an advocate for community-oriented events in public spaces and will benefit a well-established charity beer garden that began at this location in 2016. The family-friendly public tailgate successfully attracted tens of thousands of patrons each season (before a pandemic hiatus) and grossed six figures for cancer programming.\n\nA licensed drone photographer will capture photos of the Nouns glasses in situ so that images and Nouns backstory may be included in a press release for local and national media. The owner/manager of the charity event spent 26 years as a professional photographer and has numerous media and connections, including a spouse in the publishing and PR industry."},{"blockNumber":14800134,"blockHash":"0x92d57623ed18ddbfec352c0eb4a4552e53f46d005dcfa899e42f81193f0ec7ec","transactionIndex":164,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xd9c6df138a2a72bae767ddae81b46edbdd5d410c28d8b93d2c9c25614e5f2d53","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":79,"proposer":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","targets":["0xfbf87e6c2c242d0166E2Ddb60Db5A94cD4dAe00e"],"signatures":["createAsk(address,uint256,uint256,address)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000009c8ff314c9bc7f6e59a9d9225fb22946427edc0300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000fd0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003a61e942c9974000000000000000000000000000d5f279ff9eb21c6d40c8f345a66f2751c4eea1fb"],"startBlock":14813274,"endBlock":14832984,"description":"# Allocate Noun to Lil Nouns DAO -

I’ve been making Nouns-inspired art like my [Myth of Noun collection on Superrare](https://superrare.com/series/0xca4607aad52f654cf6357895c397094c077a3236) and my [Nouns at Work collection on Foundation ](https://foundation.app/collection/nounsatwork).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/N70U3r8.jpg)\n\n*The Myth of Noun & Nouns at Work collections*\n\nI am an artist with over fifteen years of experience in children’s entertainment via animation and publishing. I’m writing this proposal because I think the world needs a Nouns children’s book - and I’d like to make one.\n\n**Goals**\nIntroduce the fun, positive energy of Nouns to a young audience (and their parents). Create a wonderful nounish illustrated experience in physical form. Open a path to the traditional publishing world for Nouns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/biSbsDm.jpg)\n\n**I am a Noun**\n\nI am a Noun (tentative title) will be an illustrated book for young children where we meet, learn about, laugh with, laugh at, argue with, understand, admire and ultimately love the Nouns. It will read like a curious journey with occasional reader involvement instead of a traditional linear story. For those familiar with children’s books, think along the lines of Julie Morstad’s Today, Oliver Jeffer’s Here We Are, or Richard Scarry’s Best Word Book Ever - these books take a big idea and explore them visually and nonlinearly.\n\nThe book may start with asking a simple question to the reader: What is a noun? Our Nouns characters will have their opinions on this, which will lead to more questions, and more opinions - often at odds with each other and the narrator, with the reader stuck in the middle of it all. The book will be curious, funny, smart, absurd, and nounish… always. And it might end with another question for the reader: What kind of noun will you be?\n\nYou already have an idea of what it might look like. I don’t see the book as fully painted as my Myth of Noun pieces - probably more minimal like Nouns at Work with characters on simple backgrounds. And like the art I’ve done, I will base as much as possible on official Nouns traits. I’ll also be adding new characters (people, places, things…) and will put the Nouns glasses on almost everything.\n\nIt should be noted that the story will not directly reference the dao, nfts, crypto, ect. I would consider this project a very gentle trojan horse for nouns for a brand new audience.\n\nI will also encourage and welcome any input from the Nounders as I develop this story to keep the nounish vibes in check. ⌐◨-◨\n\n**Package**\n\nThis is not funding for a finished book, but rather funding for the development of a book submission package. Once a successful submission and sale takes place, the publisher would acquire publishing rights and offer an advance so that I may finish the rest of the book.\n\nI have literary representation (Emily Van Beek at Folio Jr. literary agency) who has already shown interest and encouraged me to pursue this idea. I will work with her to fine tune this submission and once we’re both confident that it’s ready, she will work on my behalf to find a publisher for it.\n\nI’d like funding from the DAO so I can devote time to write, illustrate and develop this idea into a package that would include:\n\n* A finished manuscript\n* A book ‘dummy’ (a sketched out layout of the full book)\n* 2-3 pages of finished art\n* Cover art\n\nThis amount of material makes up a strong package which solidifies all the main creative decisions (the concept, the story, the content and flow of the pages, and the final art style) for a confident submission.\n\nThe goal would be to have material ready to submit to publishers in fall 2022.\n\n**Funds Requested**\n\n15 ETH\n\n**Caveats**\n\n* There is a small possibility that the normy publishing world may struggle to support a project based on a nft collection, or using a public domain ‘brand’, or because we just don’t get it all those weird heads. I don’t believe any of these things will happen because A) I believe I can create a wonderful, unique book that publishers will want, and B) I love the Nouns, and I believe many others will too.\n* I’ll be relying on my agent for her experience and advice with regard to submitting, and any and all publishers, from the big 5 to smaller indie publishers may be considered. In the event that a traditional publishing deal proves difficult, self-publishing could be another option, in which case I would return to the DAO to explore further funding for production and distribution with a separate proposal.\n* The DAO should anticipate that any book published with a traditional publisher will most likely end up in a more traditional copyright situation and not CC0.\n\n**TL;DR** - I’m asking for 15 ETH to develop a robust submission package for a Nouns children’s book for traditional publishing.\n\n**About Me**\nI’ve worked for over 15 years in animation as an art director, director and creative director at Guru Studio on a range of hit animated series including Paw Patrol, True and the Rainbow Kingdom, Pikwik Pack, and Mecha Builders.

Nouners. And Nounish Friends.\n\nAs Nouns continues to strive to be a household name throughout the world, our team began to think, let us not lose our tie to our everyday life. We are not necessarily here to use our digital space as a means to escape the real world, but rather, as a means to improve it. An ethos and belief that we know many Nouners also feel.\n\nWith this in mind and our team’s love and experience in the international coffee industry, we come to the DAO and the Nouns Community with a proposal for Nouns Coffee, the first ever Nounish consumable brand. With hopes of being on the shelves of your favorite cafe, local market, or frequented grocery store. With the potential of someday having special real world locations at the corner of your favorite neighborhood to meet up and sip a cup with some of your closest nounish friends.\n\n### Nouns Coffee Brand\n*Below you will find key details on how our team plans to bring this prolific coffee brand to life.*\n\n## Phase One\n### Coffee\n\n- For Phase One of Nouns Coffee, the team will be sourcing a high-quality roaster in order to whitelabel for the brand. (read more about the potential plans for phase 2 and 3 later in this proposal)\n- Our team will use their connections within the coffee industry to find the right partner to roast our coffee. We will work diligently to ensure the highest quality coffee. This includes virtually hosted cupping sessions where we will send the roasts around to members of the community so we can all decide on the roasts together.\n- All coffee will be fair trade and organic. We care deeply about not only who drinks our coffee, but the hands that were instrumental in the planting, growing, harvesting, and roasting of our coffee.\n- Phase One will include a variety of different single origins as well as a variety of blends so that all of our nounish palettes are satisfied and caffeinated (and decaffeinated for you weirdos).\n\n### Ecommerce\n\n- In order to get Nouns Coffee into as many cups as possible, we will build an ecommerce site in order to streamline operations and provide trustworthy purchasing and shipping of Nouns Coffee.\n- This will be inclusive of a custom web experience reflective of the existing Nouns brand, to ensure a cohesive experience.\nWe will most likely use Shopify along with an integration of Coinbase Commerce in order to accept payments in crypto as well.\n- The team will work on Web3 integration to enable all Nounders and Nouners to access and claim certain coffees/roasts for free as part of their participation in the DAO.\n\n### Collateral/Advertising\n\n- Beyond just caffeinating you, we will provide you with vessels to sip from as you listen to hosted noun o’clock spaces by CDT, while at work, or out for your morning walk.\nWe will create custom cards to place in each order with QR codes (or similar) sending people to nouns.wtf so they can check out the daily auction while brewing their morning coffee.\n- Phase One will also include the creation of other nounish collateral like tote bags to carry around your coffee, your mug, your books, your HW, you name it. We’ll work with the community to decide what pieces of collateral will be best used to show off your love for the community and your love for coffee. Proliferation is the name of the game.\n\n### By Nouns for Nouns\n\n- Being a Nounder/Nouner will open the door for monthly perks from Nouns Coffee. This may come in the form of monthly coffee deliveries, custom mugs and totes, and even “Noun of the Month” featured roasts where Nouners can have their Nouns featured on the packaging etc.\n- Beyond being a Nounder or a Nouner, if you hold a Nouns Bidder POAP (brkfstsndwch’s first project for the DAO), you will also have the chance for added features and perks from Nouns Coffee.\n\n### (If prop is approved by June 9th) Soft Launch at Korea Blockchain Week 2022 in August\n\n- In collaboration with alphanonce, holders of Noun 75, we will be the Coffee Break Sponsers of Korea Blockchain Week in 2022.\n- Being the Coffee Break Sponsors of the event means:\n- Possibly the greatest branding exposure at KBW2022 as attendees are\nconstantly searching for their next cup of coffee. Branding will include\nfull-colored signage at all coffee stations, and on branded napkins and\ncoffee sleeves.\n- Thousands of eyes, and mouths, witnessing the glory of Nouns and Nouns Coffee.\n\n### Project Timeline\n#### Phase One Accelerated for Korea Blockchain Week\nFull Timeline Can Be Viewed [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G1l5sQb3JRQ5C0NGSklu_KoSe4p0KWk_/view)\n*Branding and Coffee Ready for KBW | 8-10 Weeks from Approval of Proposal*\n\n#### Phase One (if not approved by June 9th)\n4-8 Weeks | Roaster Sourcing for Whitelabel\n4-8 Weeks | Brand Identity\n6-8 Weeks | Packaging Design\n4-6 Weeks | Packaging Production\n6-8 Weeks | Collateral Design\n6-8 Weeks | Collateral Production\n6-8 Weeks | Website Design + Development\n2-4 Weeks | Coffee Production (begins after roaster is sourced)\n*Site is Live and First Bags Shipped | 12-18 Weeks from Approval of Proposal*\n\n## Phase Two\n*Sourcing/Roastery | Warehouse Leasing and Hiring Head Roaster*\n- Upon the successful adoption of Phase One and dependent on the demand for more coffee, we will submit a second proposal to lease our own warehouse and roaster, while also hiring a head roaster to roast and produce our own coffee.\n- The pros to this are the eventuality of bringing down costs, allowing us to keep our quality high, and giving us the opportunity to produce at scale.\n- A successful Phase Two will also set us up with a better position to execute on Phase Three (read below).\n- More details will of course be shared with the Nouns Community throughout Phase One as we begin thinking towards a Phase Two.\n\n## Phase Three\n*Nouns Cafe*\n- A real world cafe, bringing the meme to life. Imagine you are walking down the cobblestone streets of soho and you look to your right to see a bright red figure appear, to realize it’s a pair of noggles. The sweet aroma of nougat, chamomile, and chocolate fill the air. It pulls you in. Taking a step through the door, you see a few patrons sporting Salvino Armati’s noggles, clinking their Nounish mugs, and bidding on the auction for the day.\n\n### Team\nBrkfstsndwch | Producer and Project Manager, Liaison to Nouns Community\n**Experience:** Builder in the Nouns Community since inception, executing Nouns Bidder POAPs as their first major project with the DAO.

Each unique poster design will be posted in a grid of 8 (all 8 posters will be the same artwork), with different designs being posted in their own grid of 8 across different locations, creating a scavenger like hunt to collect all 8 artworks.\n\nEach poster will have a QR code that will allow individuals to mint 1 of 150 limited editions of each artwork. There will be 1,200 total mints at a price of 0.15 ETH each. All primary and secondary sales will go to the Vector DAO treasury to be used to purchase a Noun, replenishing the Nouns treasury. Any remaining ETH post Nouns acquisition will be split among the artists and team. As a stretch goal, we will try to support having the first 25 mints of each artwork be free, allowing this drop to be accessible to more people – this will depend on our ability to find an elegant sybil resistant solution in time.\n\nVector will provide photographers to take photos of all the posters to share on social to boost visibility (blurring out the QR code) as well as write an article about our collaboration experience with Nouns DAO to help future creators make proposals.\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/HB7iq5Y.png)\n\n## What’s in it for Nouns DAO?\n### Spread the Nouns meme\n- We're putting up 200 giant posters (6ft tall) around NYC during a high visibility week + taking photos to share online\n- The artwork will be done by a roster of top tier artists with their own audience and community\n- There's a fun game attached to being the first to find the posters and mint the limited NFTs, creating a viral loop to share back online\n- Vector DAO will use proceeds from the mint to purchase a Noun, forming a long term relationship between Vector and Nouns, helping replenish the treasury, and cementing the culture of paying it forward to more nounish builders\n\n### Pave a path for more creatives to contribute to Nouns\n- We'll bring 8 really amazing artists into the Nouns universe, who will then talk about it with their friends, driving more high caliber builders to the Nouns universe\n- This also forms a relationship with Vector DAO, a community of 80 super strong makers who are excited to further contribute to nouns\n- We'll write an article about the entire process to help onboard more makers into the community\n\n## The Artists\n[Shawna X](https://shawna-x.com) | New Yorker, Academy Awards, Nike, Google\n[Elijah Anderson](https://www.instagram.com/spacehose/) | Adidas, SNS / New Balance, Popeye’s\n[Lulu Lin](https://www.instagram.com/da__h_/) | Adobe, MAYDAY Magazine, Migrant Journal \n[Adam Ho](https://www.adamho.com/) | Cash App, Beat Foundry, Airbnb, Nike\n[Danny Jones](https://yasly.com/) | Grammy’s, Nike, New Balance\n[Haruko Hayakawa](https://www.haruko.co/) | New York Times, Bon Appetit, Fly by Jing\n[Moon Collective](https://www.instagram.com/mooncollective/) | Saturdays NYC, Instagram, Popi CBD\n_And more (pending proposal approval)_\n\n## The concept: Independent, together\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/bYQ8hIH.jpg)\n_(Similar concept for Art Basel in 2021)_\n\nWe’re commissioning 8 artists with distinct styles to create a series of posters remixing Nouns, showcasing each artist’s unique styles and perspectives (illustration, 3D, typography, color, etc). To create a consistent visual motif across the posters, the artwork must feature a Nouns artifact, but interpreted however the artist sees fit. Vector will have these artworks printed on 200+ wheatpaste posters and posted around the NFT NYC conference in Times Square and in neighborhoods like Williamsburg and SoHo.\n\nEach poster will have a QR code where viewers can mint 1 of 150 limited edition NFTs of that poster’s artwork. Each NFT edition will have a mint price of 0.15 ETH and be sold using the [Zora Protocol](https://create.zora.co/).\n\nWe hope the end product not only propagates the Nouns brand and reflects the power of placing goods in the public domain, but also the power of individuals in forming digital communities like Vector to create across both digital and physical mediums.\n\n## About Vector DAO\nVector DAO is a collective of artists, designers, and developers in web3. Our mission is to give individuals autonomy over all aspects of their work from lifestyle and creative freedom to team and compensation. We believe in a future where creatives and makers aren’t tied to any one employer but can freely contribute to communities, like Nouns, that excites them. We believe in the power of working independently, together. That means members run their own independent practices but share resources, risks, and opportunities as a community, working together in groups when projects call for it, or individually at other times. Over time, Vector hopes to prove this new model of working that other communities and builders can replicate, sustainably working for public goods and moving web3 forward.\n\n## Budget\n200 Wheatpaste posters in Times square, Williamsburg, SoHo [1]: **20 ETH ($36,000)**\n8 Independent artists’ commission [2]: **100 ETH ($180,000)**\nNFT mint mini-site design & dev [2]: **10 ETH ($18,000)**\nContribution process blog post w/ photos [2]: **0 ETH**\nTotal: **130 ETH**\n\n_[1] Vendor: TBD, evaluating several proposals_\n_[2] Vendor: Vector DAO Community_\n\n\n## Timeline\n**June 6, 2022** Artwork finished and sent to printers\n**June 20, 2022** Wheatpaste posters printed and posted around NYC\n**June 24, 2022** NFT minting closed\n\n## Artist work sample\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/d11dgfR.png)\n_Shawna X (http://shawna-x.com/, https://twitter.com/shawnax, https://www.instagram.com/shawnax/)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/E5h0QiU.png)\n_Danny Jones (https://yasly.com/, https://foundation.app/@yasly, https://twitter.com/yasly)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/Hc9nMJq.png)\n_Adam Ho (https://www.adamho.com/, https://twitter.com/omgadamho, https://foundation.app/@adam)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/KGVtNIO.png)\n_Elijah Anderson (https://www.instagram.com/spacehose)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/1Gazydq.png)\n_Moon Collective (moon-collective.com, www.instagram.com/mooncollective)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/8DbrpCv.png)\n_Lulu Lin (https://www.instagram.com/da__h_/, https://super-noodle.com/, https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/lulu-lin-illustration-050319)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/WtWop9N.png)\n_Haruko Hayakawa (https://www.haruko.co/, https://www.instagram.com/harukohayakawa/, https://foundation.app/@haruko/)_\n\n"},{"blockNumber":14893908,"blockHash":"0x1627769bffe5cd1f82124ba20197e9f92694557b26fc426cd989f3a00482f217","transactionIndex":179,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xf1288d0d7081f196d57077ffe24e0d44e984659b305393b0d96fe4ecd7d44819","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":88,"proposer":"0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d","targets":["0xd60B37A845dd086ca6b01775f98b5AA5e594504c"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":14907048,"endBlock":14926758,"description":"# Nouns IRL World Art Tour - NYC Mural\n\n# Nouns IRL World Art Tour - NYC Mural\nBy Nouns Collective\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/fJ9nndG.png)\n_(Microsoft Surface Mural, Jasper Wong)_\n\n## TL;DR\nLet’s bring Nouns to the world through a global art tour starting with Nouns IRL in NYC! This activation will take place during NFT NYC (June 20 – 23) and will feature:\n- Hand painted mural by Jasper Wong who is an artist and founder of Worldwide Walls (http://www.powwowworldwide.com/ 3), the mural will be viewable from June 20 – July 10 and will promote NFT culture by highlighting several well known projects with Nouns at the center.\n- Simple website / landing page to commemorate the mural\n\n**The activation is estimated to generate ~2.5M impressions. The total amount being requested is 87.5 ETH.**\n\n## Why Should You Care? \nWe can all agree that art is a pretty powerful communicator; it appeals to our emotions, forces us to think, and does a pretty good job of bringing us together on some level. We hope to use this power to accomplish the following: \n- Increase awareness of Nouns at NFT NYC—online and IRL\n- Increase brand awareness of the Nouns DAO as a leader in the industry;\n- Invite NFT enthusiasts and the public at large to become involved with the Nouns DAO community. We want to let people know that we are here and we invite them to come build the future with us; and,\n- Create a website (nounsirl.live) that tells the story behind the art (plan is to also include art from other cities on the tour)\n  - High-res images and time lapse video of the mural, artist’s explanation etc.\n  - Links to Nouns website, twitter, discord, etc.  \n\n## Nouns IRL — Person, Place, Thing\nNouns: person, place, thing… We thought that it would be really cool to bring this concept to IRL via fun and engaging art activations around the world. Each stop on the tour will feature a specific artist (or group of artists), a city, and an interesting Nounified art piece. Imagine Nouns on Venice Beach, or Nouns on a rehabilitated basketball court in Chicago. Imagine the looks on people’s faces if a huge inflated Noun floated by them in Miami. These art activations will vary in flight time from several weeks to several months, with the goal being to create longer lasting pieces that become a part of the cultural backdrop in the city. There are a ton of things we can explore on this tour and we think NFT NYC would be a perfect place to start. \n\n## Person\nJasper Wong, founder of [Worldwide Walls](https://www.instagram.com/powwowworldwide/?hl=en).\n\nJasper Wong is an artist, illustrator, curator and art director; his art style can be described as a unique clash of Asian-influenced pop culture on paper. Jasper has exhibited worldwide in places such as Japan, California, France, London, Mexico, New York, Hong Kong, Chicago, and Australia. Jasper is also extremely accomplished having been chosen as one of the HB100, a list of Hypebeast’s 100 most influential figures in the industry, which includes the likes of Kaws, Pharrell, Banksy, Jay Z and Kanye West.\n\nJasper is a big fan of Nouns, he has been following the project for some time and is very excited at the opportunity to get involved with the DAO. In addition to painting the mural, Jasper will be sending out Nouns-related messages on his social media platforms to engage his followers before and during the mural’s flight time. Jasper is also very well known within the art community and will attempt to leverage his network to invite some of his artist friends to hang out with him at the completed mural during NFT NYC. The goal will be to use both Jasper and his artist friends’ followers to generate additional traffic at the mural and further amplify social media impressions.\n\nJasper is very involved with the community through his non-profit organisation Pow! Wow! of which he is the creator and lead director. Pow! Wow! is a group of contemporary artists committed to community enrichment through the creation of art outreach programs, educational programs, and engaging the community in the creation and appreciation of art. Pow! Wow! has executed projects (murals, school renovations, basketball courts, etc.) in 13 cities around the globe, such as Honolulu, Taipei, Tokyo, Nepal, Guam, Seoul, Israel, and others. \n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/Gd2UFLO.jpg)\n_(Jasper Wong)_\n\n## Place\nNew York City during NFT NYC, the Super Bowl of NFT conferences.\n\nNFT NYC is the perfect staging ground for the first Nouns IRL activation. One of the stated missions of the DAO is to attract builders/creatives who are ready to create products that proliferate the Nouns brand to a wider audience and shed positive light on the concept of DAOs. NFT/crypto enthusiasts attending NFT NYC are a perfect target for this mission as many are informed about the space and are also builders/creatives looking for a project to support. The general public present in New York at this time will be surrounded by a ton of NFT related themes which should generate interest and curiosity. Many of these people (who may also be builders/creatives) have not yet fully explored the crypto space, this will be an opportunity to capture their attention and encourage them to become involved with Nouns DAO.\n\n## Thing\nSharable hand painted mural art piece promoting NFT culture (optimised for social sharing on Twitter and Instagram) and website.\n\nWe have encouraged Jasper to create a mural in his style that is a conversational piece. The mural will act as an introduction to the crypto space for many newcomers, we hope that it inspires a sense of curiosity and an urge to dig deeper. For those in the know, the mural will act as a proverbial nod of acknowledgment to the projects that have made an impact and have shed a positive light on the crypto space in general. The mural will showcase popular CC0 and non-CC0 projects such as BAYC, Doodles, Moonbirds, Cryptoads, Chain Runners, CryptoPunks, Coolcats, World of Women, Creature World, DeadFellaz, Okay Bears, etc. Each of these projects have extremely large and very loyal followings which we believe will ensure that the mural reaches the widest audience possible. The goal is to create a compelling piece which shows unity within the crypto space and inspires the viewer to get involved. \n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/HKKgICa.png)\n\nThe mural will be located at 300 W Broadway, next to the entrance of the Soho Grand Hotel, facing the busy Holland Tunnel) and will measure 8’9” H x 16’ W in size.\n\nAs mentioned above, the ultimate goal is to launch a continued effort to promote Nouns worldwide through art. NYC is the first stop of the tour. The Nouns IRL website will act as an artefact for this and all future activations. The website will contain high-res images, time lapse video, artist bio, story behind the art, and links to the discord, the main Nouns website, discourse, etc. \n\n## Budget (all figures are in USD):\n- Mural Wall: $62,000.00:\nA soft hold was placed on the mural location until the 27th of May; we are in communication with the mural company about extending the hold for at least another week. If we are able to keep the current location, the cost for the wall will be $36,000.00. The $62,000.00 amount is a rough quote for an alternate location. We are in communication with the wall company to determine if cheaper locations are available. We are more than willing to return any funds that we did not end up needing to use to secure the wall.\n- Artist: $40,000.00\n- Team: $25,000.00\n- Nouns IRL Landing page + capturing of video and photos for social: $11,000.00\n- Travel / Accommodations: $6,000.00\n\n**Total: $144,000.00, total ETH ask: 87.5 ETH**\n_Based on $1,700.00 price of ETH as of May 27, 2022; we have added 2.5 additional ETH to try and account for volatility and fees._\n\n## Team\nThis activation is being executed by the [Nouns Collective](https://twitter.com/Nounscollectiv3) (formerly the Collective DAO) which is a liquid super team made up of friends building playful, useful, and beautiful products and experiences with the crypto communities they love. We have previously contributed to the community via the [Nouns iOS app](https://www.nounsapp.wtf/) (proposal 6) which was officially launched on May 16, 2022. The Nouns Collective is composed of experienced founders, brand builders, and developers with over 15 years of experience building successful products. \n\nFor this activation we have teamed up with [@miss_singh](https://twitter.com/Miss_Singh) who is a creative professional, cultural connector, community builder, experiential expert, and entrepreneur. @miss_singh has over two decades of experience that spans industries from tech, marketing, fashion and retail with her most recent gig being with Shopify. @miss_singh is extremely excited to jump into the Web3 world with us and looks to use her considerable experience and talents to deliver a memorable and lasting experience.\n\n## To be Nountinued…\n\nWe are super excited to merge Nouns with IRL. The Nouns community is strong and vibrant; we hope to show the world who we are and what we are about. The best way to onboard more individuals, especially builders, into the space is to meet them where they are. DAOs, NFTs, blockchains, this can all be difficult to grasp for newcomers. Using familiar / traditional mediums of delivery (pop-ups, art, events, etc.) to introduce these concepts are an effective way to drive engagement. We hope that this stop on the tour will be the first of many to come!\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/9upXNjf.png)\n_(Uniqlo Mural, Jasper Wong)_"},{"blockNumber":14903756,"blockHash":"0x7a70ec547a49cc74b7e68360a0cc44f3461b147237c54ab0ff1a65c1bb9d69e2","transactionIndex":199,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x79925222064db2d3b878a66e54ca24273dabb2af147beed88c033f84c8d4004d","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":89,"proposer":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","targets":["0xd60B37A845dd086ca6b01775f98b5AA5e594504c"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":14916896,"endBlock":14936606,"description":"# Nouns IRL World Art Tour - NYC Mural\n\n# Nouns IRL World Art Tour - NYC Mural\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/fJ9nndG.png)\n_(Microsoft Surface Mural, Jasper Wong)_\n\n## TL;DR\nLet’s bring Nouns to the world through a global art tour starting with Nouns IRL in NYC! This activation will take place during NFT NYC (June 20 – 23) and will feature:\n- Hand painted mural by Jasper Wong who is an artist and founder of Worldwide Walls (http://www.powwowworldwide.com/ 3), the mural will be viewable from June 20 – July 10 and will feature Nouns in all their glory.\n- Simple website / landing page to commemorate the mural\n\n**The activation is estimated to generate ~1.7M impressions. The total amount being requested is 72.5 ETH.**\n\n## Why Should You Care? \nWe can all agree that art is a pretty powerful communicator; it appeals to our emotions, forces us to think, and does a pretty good job of bringing us together on some level. We hope to use this power to accomplish the following: \n- Increase awareness of Nouns at NFT NYC—online and IRL\n- Increase brand awareness of the Nouns DAO as a leader in the industry;\n- Invite NFT enthusiasts and the public at large to become involved with the Nouns DAO community. We want to let people know that we are here and we invite them to come build the future with us; and,\n- Create a website (nounsirl.live) that tells the story behind the art (plan is to also include art from other cities on the tour)\n  - High-res images and time lapse video of the mural, artist’s explanation etc.\n  - Links to Nouns website, twitter, discord, etc.  \n\n## Nouns IRL — Person, Place, Thing\nNouns: person, place, thing… We thought that it would be really cool to bring this concept to IRL via fun and engaging art activations around the world. Each stop on the tour will feature a specific artist (or group of artists), a city, and an interesting Nounified art piece. Imagine Nouns on Venice Beach, or Nouns on a rehabilitated basketball court in Chicago. Imagine the looks on people’s faces if a huge inflated Noun floated by them in Miami. These art activations will vary in flight time from several weeks to several months, with the goal being to create longer lasting pieces that become a part of the cultural backdrop in the city. There are a ton of things we can explore on this tour and we think NFT NYC would be a perfect place to start. \n\n## Person\nJasper Wong, founder of [Worldwide Walls](https://www.instagram.com/powwowworldwide/?hl=en).\n\nJasper Wong is an artist, illustrator, curator and art director; his art style can be described as a unique clash of Asian-influenced pop culture on paper. Jasper has exhibited worldwide in places such as Japan, California, France, London, Mexico, New York, Hong Kong, Chicago, and Australia. Jasper is also extremely accomplished having been chosen as one of the HB100, a list of Hypebeast’s 100 most influential figures in the industry, which includes the likes of Kaws, Pharrell, Banksy, Jay Z and Kanye West.\n\nJasper is a big fan of Nouns, he has been following the project for some time and is very excited at the opportunity to get involved with the DAO. In addition to painting the mural, Jasper will be sending out Nouns-related messages on his social media platforms to engage his followers before and during the mural’s flight time. Jasper is also very well known within the art community and will attempt to leverage his network to invite some of his artist friends to hang out with him at the completed mural during NFT NYC. The goal will be to use both Jasper and his artist friends’ followers to generate additional traffic at the mural and further amplify social media impressions.\n\nJasper is very involved with the community through his non-profit organisation Pow! Wow! of which he is the creator and lead director. Pow! Wow! is a group of contemporary artists committed to community enrichment through the creation of art outreach programs, educational programs, and engaging the community in the creation and appreciation of art. Pow! Wow! has executed projects (murals, school renovations, basketball courts, etc.) in 13 cities around the globe, such as Honolulu, Taipei, Tokyo, Nepal, Guam, Seoul, Israel, and others. \n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/Gd2UFLO.jpg)\n_(Jasper Wong)_\n\n## Place\nNew York City during NFT NYC, the Super Bowl of NFT conferences.\n\nNFT NYC is the perfect staging ground for the first Nouns IRL activation. One of the stated missions of the DAO is to attract builders/creatives who are ready to create products that proliferate the Nouns brand to a wider audience and shed positive light on the concept of DAOs. NFT/crypto enthusiasts attending NFT NYC are a perfect target for this mission as many are informed about the space and are also builders/creatives looking for a project to support. The general public present in New York at this time will be surrounded by a ton of NFT related themes which should generate interest and curiosity. Many of these people (who may also be builders/creatives) have not yet fully explored the crypto space, this will be an opportunity to capture their attention and encourage them to become involved with Nouns DAO.\n\n## Thing\nSharable hand painted mural art piece promoting Nouns and a simple website.\n\nWe have encouraged Jasper to create a mural in his style that is a conversational piece. The mural will act as an introduction to the crypto space for many newcomers, we hope that it inspires a sense of curiosity and an urge to dig deeper. For the more experienced, the mural will act as an introduction to Nouns; we hope that it shows them the many possibilities of being involved with the DAO. The overall goal is to create a compelling piece which introduces Nouns to the viewer and inspires the viewer to get involved. \n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/HKKgICa.png)\n\nThe mural will be located at 300 W Broadway (next to the entrance of the Soho Grand Hotel, facing the busy Holland Tunnel) and will measure 8’9” H x 16’ W in size.\n\nAs mentioned above, the ultimate goal is to launch a continued effort to promote Nouns worldwide through art.

Both have already compulsively created all manner of high quality nounish, memish content, which has garnered hundreds of thousands of impressions, and been shared countless (no, literally, we don’t know how to do this) times on twitter and discord by the wider community to express their nounishness and spread the meme.\n\nYou can see gifs already by GOAT CLUB here: [https://tenor.com/users/goldypix\n](https://tenor.com/users/goldypix)\nAnd more nounish content below:\n\n**![|588x832](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mc7wudpn0zraryj/goatclubnounishness_march2022.jpeg?dl=1)**\n\n**CONTENT**\nOur vision is to focus mostly on the content we know works; we want more of it. But we also want to be flexible, and move wherever both excites us and is getting traction. Part of the process will involve some experimentation to try to find new avenues for impact, ideally we unlock new nounish ideas. We will deliver within 1-3 months.\n\n**We will mainly focus on:**  \n* Nounish remixes of reaction gifs\n\n**With a secondary focus on:**\n* Nounified static memes, cartoon/comics, and pop culture remixes\n* Nounish artwork (pixel art and otherwise) with cultural references and memetic resonance.\n\n**And we may experiment with:**\n* Brand new nounish memes (as opposed to remixing existing memes)\n* Lo-fi nounish videos\n* …Perhaps something not yet considered\n\n**Community requests:**\n* We will create a twitter hashtag, and a channel on the nouns discord for the project (or perhaps our own discord if its neccesary) for community members to request remixes, content or share ideas.\n\n**Bonus**\n* Livestream the creation of 1-2 gifs\n* Timelapse of a creation of 1-2 gifs\n\n![|444x235](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SNtkogr9Bq5pFxATI3itMf_YblttSCdyqCWNdQJAj-Jox9AbWsYxYLQP8H8JaSM5_Hcy0nDcItBaAuDJiJbsSLB18rTWLnf8PPyzc3tO4NwG6zxpkTI1zxlwQzNwOVAlx-GbAw69)\n\n\n**ACCESS & PROLIFERATION**\nWe’ll upload everything we make to accessible repositories for easy use, especially those with native integrations to social platforms like Tenor and Giphy, as well as a repository of all the things we have made and will continue to make (Google Drive or Dropbox etc.)\n\nWe’ll convert the most appropriately scaled work as Discord reactions (emotes) for extra ease of use. (Happy to either host these on a Goat Club discord server or give to Nouns DAO server admins).\n\nWe will also make dedicated efforts to share this content, as natively as possible (as well as find ways to encourage others) via twitter and discord to increase awareness of the existence of all of them.

Additionally, to trial BLVKHVND as an operational partner for Nouns DAO esports.\n\n**Pokémon Unite:**\n\nPokémon Unite released in June 2021 and is a MOBA for Nintendo Switch and Mobile. Currently the Unite Championship Series (UCS) season 1 is underway with 1 monthly final, the regional championships ($50,000USD prize pool) and the world championship ($500,000USD prize pool) remaining until the conclusion of the season.\n\nThe official Pokémon Unite twitch channel shows 36 hours streamed over the last month with an average viewer count of 2,398 and a peak viewer count of 20,574. That peak occurred during the European AEOS Cup finals, which our proposed team won first place in. Due to that we can assume that the European Regional Finals and especially the Pokemon World Championships will beat that viewer count.\n\n**The Proposed Team:**\n\nThe proposed team we are looking to acquire is known as Random Gaming who have consistently placed 1st or 2nd in all European UCS events to date, including winning the AEOS Cup and the $20,000USD first place prize, with the top 2 teams from European Regional Championship qualifying for the World Championship on August 19th-21st in London we are confident in the team’s ability to qualify for this event.\n\nThe team consists of five players who are;\n\nADESu (Spain) - https://twitter.com/ADESuUnite 1 - Twitch\nRedmaw (Norway) - https://twitter.com/redmaw_ 1 - Twitch\nBruv (England) - https://twitter.com/BruvHD 3 - Twitch 1\nGyz (Spain) - https://twitter.com/Cepriii 1 - Twitch\nGhatlue (Germany) - https://twitter.com/Gatlue 1 - Twitch\n\nAt the time of writing this proposal, the team in total has 976 hours streamed on twitch in the last three months with a team average of 56 viewers at any given time. Most notably is BruvHD who averages 167 viewers throughout his streams in this three month period.\n\n**The Proposed Agreement:**\n\nThis proposal consists of a three month agreement with the team which will have them representing Nouns DAO for the remainder of the UCS. This agreement will consist of a signing bonus and funding a boot camp in London on the 15th - 20th of June in the lead up and during the European Regional Finals. This boot camp will be documented by a videographer to produce a mini series and various other forms of video content for the Nouns community to engage with and to spread Nouns around the gaming and Pokémon Unite community, we would be looking to utilize the Nouns DAO marketing studio, however we do have alternative options locally to London.\n\n**BLVKHVND:**\n\nBLVKHVND are the first decentralized esports organization, fielding teams through Halo, Counter Strike, Pokémon Unite, Apex Legends, Rogue Company and Blood hunt. Being knowledgeable in both the esports/gaming industry but also the web3 industry we are in a unique position to be able to contribute to this project with in depth understanding of both elements. Our involvement would be being the point of contact for the team, organizing and executing all the elements of this proposal and working alongside the existing Nouns DAO esports contributors in Sasquatch, Brennen and Brax to scale the current Nouns esports resources and continue to develop and improve the operations as well as increase our branding image and implementation of Nouns culture throughout the operation.\n\nOur tasks include but are not limited to;\n\n* Organizing and executing the Bootcamp in London on 15th - 20th of June, this consists of booking flights, accommodation, training facility, media for content creation and having a staff member on site to monitor and assist.\n* Working with the players and media contributors to create engaging content and roll out on YouTube and Twitter.\n* Monitoring events throughout the three month period and posting results to Twitter.\n* Networking with the existing Pokémon Unite community to spread the Nouns brand through additional tournaments and media opportunities.\n* Using BLVKHVND in-house media team in potential collaboration with the Nouns media studio to implement Nouns branding to the players social media accounts and content platforms such as youtube and twitch, this consists of banners, profile pictures and stream assets.\n* Using BLVKHVND in-house media team in potential collaboration with the Nouns media studio to create engaging images and short form video to post to twitter during tournaments to drive engagement and viewership to Nouns esports tournament performances.\n* Maintaining consistent communications with all the players on the team to ensure smooth operations throughout the agreement and guarantee a positive interaction between the team and Nouns esports.\n* Pending qualification for Pokémon World Championships in London on August 19th - 21st, organizing all flights and accommodation in collaboration with the Pokémon Company. During the event having a staff member escorting the team to assist them with anything they require.\n* Pending qualification for Pokémon World Championships in London on August 19th - 21st, organizing media for content creation surrounding the London event and working alongside them to roll out the media.\n* BLVKHVND sourced the team presented in this proposal, negotiated on the proposed offer and constructed the proposal presented.\n* All the expenses listed above being the labour, travel and accommodation are covered in the BLVKHVND management services fee.

With the top-tier UX talent from 0xDesigner, the unmatched creative prowess of SerNoadz, the development expertise of Plaid Shaman, and Brkfstsndwh (along with a direct line to Patricio and the POAP team), we aim to deliver a creative and engaging experience that will continue the spin wheel and proliferation of the meme to a whole new audience.\n\n## Why\nThrough our V1 experiment, our team believes that having an ongoing incentive around bidding in the daily auction is not only beneficial to the DAO (promoting increased bidding on daily auctions to add capital to the treasury), but also allows more people to feel like they are a part of the DAO without actually winning the Noun on auction. POAP and team also have some fun ideas for incentives that will be coming via a secondary proposal (think, raffling off a Noun to POAP winners).\n\n## What\n- Revamped Gallery Page + Auction House and POAP Integrations\n- More Advanced Claiming Mechanism\n- Updated POAP Art with New Artists\n- Retroactive POAPs for Winners Since V1 Ended\n- 6 Months of POAPs and Management from Launch Date\n\n## How\n### Revamped Gallery Page + Integrations\n- We will work with our team of designers and developers to create a revamped gallery page for showcasing the daily POAP, past POAPs, and winning bidders.\n- This page will also show the live auction data for each daily auction, showcasing which bidders are currently in the running to receive one of the daily POAPs.\n- Beyond that, we will integrate the POAP API more seamlessly to make the entire experience of the POAP page more engaging and informative.\n\n### More Advanced Claiming Mechanism\n- With our direct connection to the POAP team, we will work on building a more robust claiming mechanism than the direct send we conducted in V1.\n\n### Updated POAP Art with New Artists\n- Working with the incredibly talented SerNoadz, we will create a unique and updated art style for the Bidder POAPs.\n- We will also aim to commission featured artists monthly that are voted on by the DAO to create unique POAP art in their own nounish style.\n- Below is just an example of some of SerNoadz’s work, and is by no means the final art style. We will work with the community to land on the final and approved art style for the key POAP art.\n- See example art and full prop [here](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-bidder-poap-v2/1440).\n\n### Retroactive POAPs for Winners Since V1 Ended\n- Once the art is complete, we will retroactively send all POAPs to their rightful winners since V1 concluded in May at Noun 296.\n\n## Who\nProducer + Project Manager | Brkfstsndwch\n**Experience:** With close to a decade of production and product management experience, Brkfstsndwch has managed projects ranging from rebrands for some of tech’s biggest companies to 360 campaigns to website + app builds to feature-length documentaries and so many things in between. Brkfst was also responsible for the proposal and execution of the Bidder POAP V1 project, Nouns Coffee, and has been a part of the Nouns Community since the beginning.\n\nLead Artist | SerNoadz\n**Experience:** An artist that needs no introduction, SerNoadz has been a staple in the Nouns community nearly since its inception, proliferating Nouns day in and day out with their project Noadz, among a plethora of other crucial pieces that have helped the DAO become what it is today. Most recently the current Nouncil site.\n\nUX Designer | 0xDesigner\n**Experience:** Being the lead designer on the POAP V1 project, 0xDesigner has a proven track record at executing to the highest degree. Beyond their involvement in the DAO, 0x is a product designer with a decade of experience working with companies ranging from seed stage startups to big tech like Facebook and Google. 0x has designed and helped launch over 50 digital products via founding a globally ranked UX agency.\n\nDeveloper | Plaid Shaman\n**Experience:** For nearly 20 years, Plaid Shaman (Brian) has been working with startups, agencies, and non-profits bringing 100s of projects to life.

This proposal is to ask Nouns to fund a repository of cc0 space images for all artists to use freely in their work. Sponsored by the Nouns DAO, the website will feature nounish elements as well as an \"about section\" with information about Nouns. The Nouns ecosystem will be proliferated through exposure to the artistic community as well as any potential exposure from the featuring of the space images on mainstream and specialized media. Total amount requested: 12 Eth.\n\n# About me:\nIf you prefer to watch instead of reading, check out this short video I made for my SuperRare application to learn more about myself and my work. \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1iffK8n9uYuJgV8BmHjQaYXPuhgGmvHxi/view?usp=sharing\n\nMy passion for space and astronomy started at a very early age and I started shooting astrophotography about 7 years ago when I first paired a camera to the eyepiece of my telescope. After doing this as a hobby for several years, two years ago I decided to quit my job in TV and film production to become a full time astrophotographer. In early 2021 I minted my first NFT and throughout this past year I've released two collections and over 20 1/1 NFTs. During this past year, my work has been featured across several media outlets such as NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day and the European Space Agency's social media profiles, as well as a number of astronomy websites and magazines, and I've even had the honor of having one of my pictures used as a stamp of the Argentine Postal Service.\n\n\n\n# Goal:\n\nAs a way to give visibility to the Nouns DAO, a cc0 image bank of space images will be set up that will serve as a repository for artists working on space-themed art. Space is a huge theme in cryptoart and NFTs. These images will be free to be used as subjects, backdrops and to be repurposed as artists see fit without the need to attribute authorship, giving artists complete control. The url **cc0images.wtf** has already been secured to this end.\n\n**Nouns proliferation:**\n\nThe website would be designed in line with the Nouniverse aesthetics and would contain an \"about'' section with information about Nouns. Besides strengthening ties and gaining visibility within the artist community, space images are regularly featured on specialized and mainstream media, which could potentially increase visibility to the Nouns community outside the art/NFT circles, by being featured by space agencies and more traditional media outlets reaching the general public. When published in  media, images would be credited to the photographer and the Nouns DAO.\n\n**Website Mockup:**\n\n![690x460]( https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e2982b_b37b352373d746f89df20b099d550a89~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_750,h_421,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/mockup%20portada%20copy.jpg)\n\n![690x460]( https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e2982b_27fa02424e8f4ef095329ff2748b6f8d~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_750,h_421,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/mockup%20about%20copy.jpg)\n\n# About the images:\n\nAs technology has pushed forward during the past years, the ability to image deep space objects like distant galaxies or nebulae has stopped being the exclusive realm of observatories and space telescopes, and amateur astronomers worldwide now have access to hardware that allows them to photograph these stunning objects.

Tens of hours of exposures as well as extensive processing time are needed in order to capture these objects, and most objects only appear in the night sky during limited periods of time during the year so the collection would be slowly built throughout an entire year. Some of the images will be shot from my rooftop observatory but others require traveling to dark sky sites. The images will be a balanced mix of deep space objects shot on telescopes, solar system bodies (Sun, Moon and planets), widefield images (star fields, milky way shots, star trail images) and landscape astrophotography, to offer a wider variety of objects and backdrops for artists.\n\nLaunch of the website would be scheduled six months after proposal is approved with an initial amount of 15 images at launch, and another 15 images would be added after a second six month period (this second update could be scheduled at shorter, more frequent intervals with a smaller amount of images).\n\n# Budget\n\nProject management and execution, consisting of planning and acquiring the images throughout a one year period - 5 Eth\n\nEquipment upgrades (purchases to upgrade equipment already owned) - 3 eth\n\nExpenses for dark sky sites travel - 2 eth\n\nWebsite development and maintenance (according to scope of this proposal) - 2 eth\n\nTotal: 12 Eth\n\n**Thank you for reading!

This is a world first: a community-owned baked bean brand, and a true collaboration between Nouns and Sublime Butter (that’s us). To deliver on this vision, we’re asking for $150,000 (c.135 Ether).\n\n---\n\n**Who we are**\n\nWe’re Sublime Butter Ltd. We’re a UK-based butter company with a huge array of awards under our belt. We have excellent in-roads with distributors, a proven track record of amazing product development, and a profound understanding of brand.\n\n[![https://i.ibb.co/949CgRH/Awards.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/949CgRH/Awards.jpg)](https://sublimebutter.com/)\n\nBut that’s not all. We have in our midst a team of powerful developers, designers, storytellers, marketers and strategists who are at the absolute top of their game. Between us we have won two Emmy awards, three Webby awards, and had two BAFTA nominations.\n\n---\n\n**What are the opportunities?**\n\n1) There are a variety of legal, regulatory and licensing must-haves required to be an FMCG brand. It also takes a lot of skill, knowledge and experience to develop, produce and distribute a successful FMCG product. This makes it a tough market for a DAO to break into. UNLESS you have us as a partner. \n\n2) The baked bean industry in the UK is ENORMOUS. Brits get through two million tins of them every single day. And yet, it is one of the plainest and most uninventive verticals on a supermarket shelf. We think this makes it ripe for disruption.\n\n---\n\n**Introducing MOOØNBEANS**\n\nNouns-branded baked beans, developed according to Sublime’s incredible recipe. Each 400g tin will be sold for c. £2.50.\n\nWe really want to stress that this is a true collaboration, a first-of-type web3/CC0/real-world merger. Nobody has ever done anything like this before, because such a relationship has never been fostered before. It’s truly symbiotic, totally unprecedented, and paints an extremely exciting picture for the future.\n\nEach tin will feature a Nouns character that is also represented in our marketing and on-site. We’re thinking four tin variants should be a good place to start for launch.\n\nNouns DAO will get **20% of all profits** from MOOØNBEANS sales. \n\nMoreover, getting this right (which we know we will) opens up a huge range of other opportunities in the FMCG space, and therefore a huge range of prospective revenue streams into the Nouns ecosystem. \n\n![https://i.ibb.co/mHg8fJr/Can-V2.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/mHg8fJr/Can-V2.jpg)\n\n*Here’s a mock-up of some tins. Note: This is **super early,** and designed for illustrative purposes only. The actual branding, tins, website, etc. — all of which are a part of the scope of work — will be truly, abundantly Nounish.*\n\n---\n\n**Why we’re doing this**\n\n- We believe in web3/CC0\n- We love Nouns and everything it represents; we want to raise awareness of Nouns in an area that’s usually difficult to break into\n- We want to position Sublime as a pioneering FMCG brand in the web3 space\n- We believe there are a range of collaboration opportunities here, and this is an excellent test case for future disruption together\n- We want to build a solid foundation for the wider MOOØNBEANS ecosystem\n\n**Budget**\n\nWe are asking for $150k USD to take MOOØNBEANS to market (c.135 $ETH at the time of writing). Proposal costings within the model have been denominated in fiat because of the nature of FMCG engagements and their payments.\n\nBudget Breakdown\n\n- Brand & Product Development – $25k USD\n- Website & eCom – $25k USD\n- Initial MOOØNBEAN Production – $35k USD\n- Initial Marketing – $65k USD\n- **Total: $150k**\n\nProfits from MOOØNBEANS will be consolidated in ETH and proportionally distributed back to a Nouns wallet address of your choosing on a monthly basis from month seven post launch.\n\nA full model for the proposal is available as a spreadsheet on request.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\nIn terms of our approach to delivering this project, we wanted to stress that we’ll be operating with full transparency. MOOØNBEANS will function as a distinct profit centre, and all accounts will be made public for the Nouns community to view. \n\nIn terms of specifics, we’ll be delivering the following:\n\n- Brand development for MOOØNBEANS\n- Content strategy\n- Product development\n- Distribution strategy (UK first, then US by next year)\n- Basic website development\n- Integrated eCom functionality built into both [mooonbeans.com](https://mooonbeans.com) and [sublimebutter.com](http://sublimebutter.com) enabling the purchase of MOOØNBEANS\n- Marketing plan with a heavy focus on mainstream consumer press\n\n**Benefits to Nouns**\n\n- Access to CPG/FMCG\n- Real world revenues; first of its kind\n- Major marketing and PR exposure\n- Exciting new way to get people into crypto\n- Future potential (e.g. other verticals)\n\n**Timings**\n\n---\n\n![https://i.ibb.co/HFYQt37/Whats-App-Image-2022-06-10-at-11-57-31-AM.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/HFYQt37/Whats-App-Image-2022-06-10-at-11-57-31-AM.jpg)\n\n\n**Future Phases**\n\nIf you’ve seen V1 of this proposal, you’ll know that we have a big vision for MOOØNBEANS. One that extends beyond physical products. Once we have successfully delivered on this core proposition, we have a huge range of ideas that will deepen and enhance it — with a view to stimulating mass consumer adoption, further proliferating Nouns and its derivatives, and creating other FMCG goods that will expand the Nouns x Sublime brand universe. Ideas like:\n\n- Educational content that guides novices through their first crypto transactions/interactions\n- Games, stories, and easter eggs that spotlight Nouns and other communities\n\n**Transaction Details**\n\ntx1: 135E to sublime.eth (proposal funding)\n\ntx2: 0.69E to apenoun.eth (coordination & prop building)\n\nN.b. The plan will be to convert all the ETH to USDC/stablecoin assuming proposal passes\n\n**Project updates**\n\nFortnightly Twitter Spaces\n\nFortnightly Medium progress update posts\n\nDiscord community updates\n\n---\n\n**Closing**\n\nThanks so much for reading and considering our proposal, Nouners. We’re always around to answer questions or even just to chat, so we look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nTeam MOOØNBEANS"},{"blockNumber":14996915,"blockHash":"0xc86ca7dc62d679d9bb10a89a3eb97f62a4c1c816dff529c5bf08a4cd7ddb1865","transactionIndex":109,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x7f5b75c3ca44e8792fdceff84bd9049e4dc503f0f1ef109d1efa99702a3d786f","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":98,"proposer":"0x36A5Bc205DF1ED65C86301022cfc343a6ce546ff","targets":["0x9C99BF82fC38713C471D4415f66c8336D361501a"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15010055,"endBlock":15029765,"description":"# NOUNS IN RIO - Nouns to be a part of the 1st Brazilian international NFT exhibition\n\n# tl;dr\n\nNouns to be a part of the 1st Brazilian international NFT exhibition held in Rio de Janeiro.\n30 June until 3 July 2022\n22 ETH\n\n⌐◨-◨\n\n\n[![nounify-Rio.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XYbwhQSz/nounify-Rio.png)](https://postimg.cc/zVxbHwfC)\n\n\n# WHAT?  \n\n# The “11 Nouns as part of the exhibition” is already a done deal!\n\n11 Nouns will be displayed during the event in Rio and on 300+ digital billboards in Rio de Janeiro (6.7 million people) and São Paulo (12.3 million people).\n\n[![Billboards.png](https://i.postimg.cc/25mdMTv5/Billboards.png)](https://postimg.cc/zytRRCxm)\n\n\nThis proposal is for expanding, even more, the exposure that Nouns will have during the event which will be held at Parque Lage (Rio de Janeiro).\nParque Lage is a point of reference for artistic experimentation, research and innovation.\nIn addition, it is an impressive century-old building in the middle of the largest urban forest in the world (image below).\n\n\n[![Parque-Lage.png](https://i.postimg.cc/q7SK0L6n/Parque-Lage.png)](https://postimg.cc/wt5MQDVT)\n\n\n\nThis proposal is a part of the broader Nouns DAO Brazil initiative led by [B](https://twitter.com/beautyandpunk) (Noun #137) to Nounify Brazil and bring Portuguese language natives into Nouns.\n\nBased on the success of Japan, Art Basel, Nouns in Hong Kong and NounsDAO Amigos, we propose the following:\n\n1.

I propose to display nouns glasses on 5 sailboats in the middle of Seoul, South Korea. Seoul is home to 15+ million people and a lot of interest towards blockchain and NFTs among the population. The Korean government, businesses, and people are interested in blockchain and the NFT space. Hangang river is surrounded by two highways and will be a perfect place to reach lots of people during rush hours. The two way distance will be around 40+ kilometers. This could be a great opportunity to advertise NounsDAO and attract potential future members and developers.\n- I know lots of sailors who want to participate in the Nouns Seoul PR campaign. I will create a fleet of five J/24 sailboats and sail along the river from Kimpo international airport to Itaewon bridge and back. This event is going to be organized for NounsDAO. There will be only 5 sailboats with spinnakers with Nouns Glasses logos.\n- The idea is to make as many people remember Nouns-glasses. I identify two types of impressions offline and online. Images of Nouns glasses on 5 sailboat in the middle of the river will spark curiosity in the minds of the bypassers. This campaign is not a spam like poster or post that many of us learned to ignore without noticing. People would remember Nouns glasses and later when they attend a conference or buy NFTs they would recognize the Nouns symbol and would eventually come straight to the NounsDAO!\n- The spinnakers are big and span an area of 8 meters in height and 4 meters in width. They definitely can be used as decoration at different events. I think the best use for sails is to give them to the teams. There are about five good regattas every year in Korea, I will provide more content free of charge when we race at different events. I am sure a pretty spinnakers with Nouns Glasses would be appreciated by the teams and used for many years.\n\n### Map\n\n![https://media.giphy.com/media/PS8lP8bBk0ICeuIYJE/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/PS8lP8bBk0ICeuIYJE/giphy.gif)\n\n### Spinnaker sail designs\nI have connections to Hyde sails dealership and can place an expedited order for 5 spinnaker sails with printed logo of the nouns glasses.

Unable to continue funding on my own, I sold to an LLC but I retained an ownership share that allows me a chance to preserve the community event. I'm looking for an open-minded and nimble capital source to help the beer garden remain open to the public this fall while sponsors budget for FY2023. When @4156 tweeted an invitation (see below), it was clear that a DAO could be our saving grace. Relatively modest support could positively affect thousands of lives with a *MONUMENTAL* return on investment for the Nouns community.\n\n**Benefits to Nouns**\n\n* **MAKE NOUNS VISIBLE FROM SPACE** — massive Nouns glasses will be emblazoned on a synthetic turf installation. At 60 feet wide, they will be large enough to be visible when satellite maps are updated, meaning they'll become part of the permanent record, obvious to anyone on site *and* to anyone using Google Earth/Maps or other online navigation tools near the largest stadium in the country and a top university. Because synthetic turf doesn't require cutting and won't wear down under foot, the glasses can stay as long as it takes for the next satellite maps update. \n![](https://i.imgur.com/YA4IZkR.jpg)\n\n\n* **Nouns billboard/banner** — 12-foot Nouns glasses will watch over the crowd, evident not only to the thousands of beer garden guests but unmistakable, even at a distance, to the tens of thousands walking past on game day.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M1i9gW2.png)\n\n\n\n* **Nouns pole banners** — Nouns ubiquity continues as glasses appear in pairs on pole banners flying high above the crowd.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AtRFjN2.png)\n\n\n* **Drone photos + press release** — a licensed drone photographer will capture images of the multitude of Nouns glasses *in situ* to accompany a press release describing the event and directing people to learn more about Nouns DAO.\n\n* **TBD special event** — plans are in motion to turn the night game on September 10 into an extended affair to remember with music stage and celebrity appearances.\n\n* **And more** — Nouns glasses and URL on event signage, pint cups, staff t-shirts, event website, press release, social media, etc.\n\n**What does this mean for Nouns?** \n\n* **Proliferation** and public relations on a colossal scale: The eight-game event season will put Nouns in front of more *new eyes* than any other event. Unlike NFT-oriented gatherings where attendees are familiar with Nouns (e.g., NFT.NYC), sponsorship at the largest normie events of the year will introduce an entirely new population to the DAO in a positive and productive light — doing good for the community. There are incredible opportunities to expand Nouns brand recognition with in-person visitors immersed in Nouns iconography and countless others learning the Nouns story through media coverage of events.\n\n* **Nounish culture**: what better way to reinforce the Nouns ethos than to support an inclusive community event and serve as ambassadors to the web3 ecosystem.\n\n* **Diversity**: there's no other event like this. Nouns would be on the vanguard of DAO philanthropy, supporting the largest charity event of its kind. In return, Nouns would be the first NFT/PFP visible from earth orbit.\n\n* **Successful track record**: this isn't a request to gamble on our success, it's a well-established event looking to remain publicly accessible in its post-pandemic return. Since it began in 2016, the beer garden has attracted tens of thousands of patrons each season and grossed six figures for charity.\n\n**Who else is involved?**\nNouns DAO will join a roster of CONFIRMED partners. We're still negotiating sponsorships with a few other key players (\"TBA\" below).  We've already pitched DAO membership to some of them and plan to invite the others to join us in the web3 space. Ideally, the event series will grow in subsequent seasons with support from new high-profile Nouns DAO members.\n\n* **[Truly Hard Seltzer](https://trulyhardseltzer.com/)** — the #2 player in the hard seltzer category will expand beer garden options for thirsty patrons.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5WDruFd.png)\n\n* **[Twisted Tea](https://www.twistedtea.com/)** — The #1 contender in the FMB sector will add even more depth to the drink lineup.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziz2bks.png)\n\n\n* **[Slows Bar BQ](https://slowsbarbq.com/)** — Detroit's finest barbecue has been featured every season since 2016 and their food truck will be back this fall with premium tailgate fare.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1KvVKdv.png)\n\n* **[Zingerman's Creamery](https://www.zingermanscreamery.com/)** (& coffee) — the creamery arm of Zingerman's Deli, one of the best in the Midwest, will provide gelato and/or hot coffee/cocoa depending on the game day weather forecast.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jU8Qi2e.png)\n\n* **[Hotaling & Co](https://www.hotalingandco.com/).** — their whiskey warehouse survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire long before they became a leader in super-premium artisanal spirits; they will augment the drink menu with custom cocktails, including a signature drink created for the occasion.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RYBPJNl.png)\n\n\n* **[**Cancer Support Community**** — the local chapter](https://www.cancersupportannarbor.org/) of the [national](https://www.cancersupportcommunity.org/) 501(c)(3) non-profit organization is our co-host, securing the state special permit for alcohol service at the beer garden; CSC volunteers staff the event and pour drinks.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/G9Q0nbv.png)\n\n* TBA **national brand soft drink partner** — the largest distributor for the #1 soft drink brand in the US has signed on to provide non-alcoholic options. We're still lobbying for a partnership with the cola giant. Stay tuned.\n\n* TBA **national brand beer partner** — we're in conversations with a leading national beer brand portfolio and hope to see them become a major sponsor and the next prominent beverage company to join Nouns DAO.\n\n* TBA we're chatting with, but still have to confirm, a premium **handmade Vodka out of Austin, TX** to supplement our cocktail lineup\n\n* We've snagged **DJ WaltAmore** (house DJ at Tin Roof, Detroit) to spin for us this season\n\n* We've engaged the services of a sports marketing professional with experience in charitable event planning for organizations, pro athletes, and their non-profit endeavors. More info TBA.\n\n**What does this mean to the charity? What happens if the proposal fails?**\nIn short, Nouns support provides a stay of execution for the *publicly accessible* event. Without sponsor support to maintain community access, the charity beer garden will not return in 2022. Instead, the site will be turned over to private and corporate interests. It's a manifestation of the conflict between web2 and web3...centralized ownership versus open access. \n\nA successful DAO vote means the charity event sees new life *plus* a foundation for future growth. As in the past, 100% of beer/seltzer/FMB/cocktail sales will benefit Cancer Support Community programming: education; counseling; financial assistance; healthy living (exercise, stress management, nutrition) programming; social activities for adults, teens and children; and other CSC fundraising events. Enthusiastic national brands are poised to underwrite the future of the series but, in the middle of a fiscal cycle, budget dollars have already been allocated. Nouns sponsorship this fall would provide a bridge to next season when beverage and other brand sponsors can earmark funds for their participation.\n\nIn sports entertainment marketing circles, this location is a unicorn. Of roughly two dozen properties covered by a city council resolution granting broad game day allowances to specific properties in the stadium vicinity, it's the only available vacant parcel this large. Sponsorship value has been estimated by sports marketing agencies at $12-18/sqft per game based on site characteristics, recent team performance, and media coverage that accompanies the nationally televised events around which the beer garden is scheduled.\n\n* Proximity to venue — 285 yards to stadium gate\n* Generous open space — over 10,000 square feet\n* Privately owned — no municipal or university red tape\n* Existing municipal approvals for game day sales and commercial display\n* No neighbors to complain — no residential units within 400 feet\n\nHaving a respected and successful history here, the charity event has a right of first refusal to remain...but only if we can secure a sponsor. If we continue, the beer garden will offer the closest alcohol sales to the largest football crowd in the country at a stadium that doesn't serve beer (and the nearest bar a mile away). \n\n**What is the ask?**\nThe benefits to the community are beyond measure but the cost is easy to quantify — roughly the equivalent of two freshly minted Nouns. Let's check the math: the average price of a new Noun over the past 30 days is just under 110 ETH. Assuming/hoping ETH doesn't fall below $1050 before we can successfully float this proposal, two Nouns would total $220,500 — just under the minimum needed to keep the event in public hands (see cost breakdown below). \n\nAt the YTD average mint price (a conservative 80 ETH per Noun) the DAO treasury will increase by almost 6,000 ETH before the event series starts in September. We respectfully request 225.15 ETH, a little over twice the daily mint price, to preserve the community charity event. \n\n**Why are we asking Nouns for help?**\nIt's been asked, \"why should Nouns sponsor this particular event?\" There is no inherent link between Nouns and a college football beer garden but there are extraordinary benefits for both parties. A year after meeting @4156, his tweet on Feb. 17 was a welcome invitation to engage an open-minded and responsive community. “**Shill us your crazy ideas**,” he said, “**we will fund them!**” If I couldn't send a Nouns to space but I could make Nouns visible FROM space. The Nounish ethos of bootstrapped identity and community is embodied in what we've achieved and hope to continue. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M75Hg6R.png)\n\n\n\n**Where will the money go?**\nBefore the current bearish dip, 225 ETH would have been enough to ensure a long and healthy future for the beer garden. It's still enough to fund the bare-bones improvements to benefit Nouns and the event series. If funded, we'd convert crypto to fiat immediately to cover the synthetic turf installation. The Nouns flags and banners described above would be out-of-pocket-expenses. The list below includes improvements that will follow as additional funding allows (calculated at $1050/ETH).\n\n* **224 ETH: Synthetic turf installation INCLUDING 60-FOOT NOUNS GLASSES** — we've been quoted a 1.5-inch finished pile that uses an environmentally friendly backing and infill with realistic color and exceptional durability and drainage. Turf materials, excavation and installation run $14/sqft for 11,000 feet of coverage. Ultrabase underlayment panels ($6/sqft) will go in between the compacted gravel base and the turf/infill to handle large vehicle traffic (food trucks, beer trailers, buses, dumpster service, portajohn maintenance). Infill and perimeter board add $15,000 to bring the total cost to $235,000.\n\n* **0.4 ETH: Nouns Glasses Billboard/Banner** — One 6x12' heavy-duty vinyl outdoor banner with grommets and heat-welded hems \n\n* **0.75 ETH Nouns Pole Banners** — Four double-sided 2x5' pole banners and hangers, to install in pairs on two utility poles on site\n\n**Is that the end of it? What comes next?**\nTwo Nouns (225 ETH) allows the charity event to last another year, allowing time to negotiate future sponsorship. If this proposal succeeds and Nouns feedback is positive, we may draft a follow-up proposal to name Nouns as the lead sponsor of the event. It wouldn't take much to get there...maybe the equivalent of a third Noun:\n\n* **72 ETH: Fifty 10-foot Polysteel Picnic Tables** — community seating for up to 500 people at once (excl. shipping or assembly)\n\n* **25 ETH: One 40x100' frame tent with water ballast tanks** — it's less expensive to purchase than to rent for the eight events in a single charity season (excl. dis/assembly & storage cost)\n\n\n**About me, the location, and the charity:**\nI spent more than two decades as a professional photographer, winning two Emmy Awards and a pair of national POY honors before moving into software where I helped commercial and educational clients manage and monetize digital assets. I started my own business but continue to pursue this labor of love. I avoid the spotlight so there are more mentions of the charity organization than of me in Google search results. I bought the property in 2007 and hosted the community event free of charge until I was unable to sustain my out-of-pocket support and gave up control to an LLC. I remain a member so I have the opportunity to seek sponsorship for the charity event before the LLC turns the property over to private interests.\n\nWhy wait so long to say *WHERE* this event takes place? Because sports fans have passionate feelings about which teams they do and don't support. The largest stadium in the country, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is home to a team that engenders strong feelings, for *and* against.  I didn't want non-fans to react to the team before understanding the benefits.\n\nThe cause that we support is the [local chapter](https://www.cancersupportannarbor.org/) of the national 501( c)(3) non-profit [Cancer Support Community](https://www.cancersupportcommunity.org/). One hundred per cent of beer sales go to the CSC to support education; counseling; financial assistance; healthy living (exercise, stress management, nutrition) programming; social activities for adults, teens and children; and other CSC fundraising events. The CSC is supportive of my Nouns outreach and the Director addressed a letter of support to any potential sponsors.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nYsyunS.png)\n"},{"blockNumber":15031117,"blockHash":"0x1d58bb6e8afe8ada798ed0b784099f19c3ed1d1b125abff6ffaa4de26740b0d6","transactionIndex":55,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x398b850352632a61256392cb1491e0f7857e9659e5ba012fdbe5ee86e7728135","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":101,"proposer":"0xf6C625851d48FE26B50D96B821a87eFC7e35c222","targets":["0xB903576F03a1010D7b915783C728B5C39EdD9A54"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15044257,"endBlock":15063967,"description":"# The Noun Square: A Daily Noun O' Clock Celebration\n\n## Summary\n\n- [The Noun Square](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock) is a daily Twitter Spaces ritual celebrating Noun O' Clock (NOC) in a fun and engaging format.\n- Spearheaded by [Toady Hawk](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk), [Ser Noadz](https://twitter.com/thenoadz) and myself ([142](https://twitter.com/1fortytwo)). Administered by a thriving and growing community (join our [discord](https://discord.gg/qsUk2v4ZB3)!).\n- We've completed a 14 day pilot of daily spaces and contests every day, with excellent results.\n\n### Pilot Metrics\n-  ~110 daily attendees, 60+ daily FOMO players \n- 500+ twitter followers (up from 0)\n- 250K tweet impressions (!!) \n- 200+ pieces of nounish content produced in 9 daily contests \n- 400+ POAPs claimed for attending the spaces\n- 11 special nounish guests\n\n### Short term goals\n- Grow attendance & engagement\n- Iterate on show format and deepen our \"show/market fit\"\n- Grow our community of hosts and contributors \n\n### Longer term goals\n- Make NOC a global Internet shared moment\n- Grow reach to thousands of concurrent participants, and later much much more\n\n### Our Ask\n- We are asking for 55 ETH total to continue this initiative for a 1 month period.\n- Doing this daily is a lot of work (about 10 man-hour a day on average. More detailed breakdown below.)\n    - 10 ETH will be earmarked for contests themed around the Noun of the day. \n    - 45 ETH will go to community contributor rewards (biweekly retro rewards administered by CoordinApe rounds, modeled after Nouncil.)\n\n\n---\n\n## Who We Are\n\nWe are a community of Nounish builders setting out to create a Daily Celebration of Noun O’ Clock called The Noun Square, administered by a Nouncil-like body and with the goal of proliferating Nouns by turning Noun O’ Clock into a “Shared Moment” for the entire Internet. We have successfully completed two week pilot using a combination of Small Grants and out-of-pocket funds for prizes (data from which which has informed this proposal)   \n\n## Our vision\n\nFor anyone who grew up in the 70s, 80s or 90s, “The Price is Right” holds a special place in our collective psyche. For over 50 years, its daily blend of ritual and play has entertained hundreds of thousands of people the world over.  We believe Noun O’ Clock can recreate this kind of shared experience for web3.\n\n**Broad Goals:**\n\n- **Turn NOC into a daily shared global moment** - develop a grass-root, organic, daily show that introduces more people to  nouns & its thriving community & sub-communities. As well as creates a space in which our growing community can meet daily and share a live moment together.\n\n\n- **Model our community on Nouncil** - a collective of builders all over the globe with varied skillsets, collaborating to organize and administer a daily Twitter Spaces. We think that a decentralized community model can be the nounish way to scale a Noun O' Clock show! \n\n- **Be consistent (”one NOC, every day, forever”)** - Even in the deep NOC winter, we believe consistency is key to cementing NOC as a daily celebration for the Internet. We are planning ahead for this with hosts from all over the world.\n\n\n## The (Current) Format\n\n- Begin 15 min before NOC every day.\n- Contest review & announcements.\n- Casual guest interview while watching/discussing end of daily Noun auction.\n- Play FOMO Live together (we invite as many attendees as possible to come on stage and keep mics open for an interactive experience.)\n- Give live Secret Word for those who wish to collect POAP for attendance.\n\n*On weekends, we run a LITE version of The Noun Square featring only FOMO live, hosted by a different nounish community every Saturday (e.g. Lil Nouns and GOOP DAO the past two weeks, future guest hosts Nouns DAO Japan, Korean Noun Fans, NounPunks, FloriNouns, etc.)\n\n## The Team: 3 C's\n\n**Core Team (Responsible for Execution):**\n- Toady Hawk\n- Noun 142\n- Ser Noadz\n\n**Council (Responsible for Decisions and Daily Direction)**\n\n- SuperTightWoody\n- Goldy\n- Joshua Fisher\n- Maty\n- Benbodhi\n- !Xargs\n- Sam Ellis\n- Aubtoshi\n- RyanMac21\n\n**Community (Talent Funnel for Council)**\n- Growing Discord Community\n\n## Growing the community\n\n- We want to grow the community and **build in the open.** We have created a Discord server [open to anyone who wants to contribute.](https://discord.gg/qsUk2v4ZB3) We have also created a public Google Sheet that tracks our progress and metrics and future plans for [anyone to follow along](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-zmEFFLxUszyKZzo8CJP6KlXC581NkPLtek4GN6h7T8/edit?usp=sharing).\n- Hosting a live Spaces every day is an audacious goal (albeit one we are excited about), and will require participation and help from Nounsfolk in all timezones, especially as NOC drifts into the North American Night.\n\n## Compensation Model\n\nOur ask for the next 30 days is 55 ETH:\n\n- **Contest rewards (0.5 eth/day * 20 weekdays = 10 ETH)**\n    - We will experiment with these numbers and the cadence of them as we move forward, but so far this amount and cadence has produced excellent participation.\n\n- **Team reward + operations (see budget below): 45 ETH**\n    - Because we intend to build this initiative as a community effort, we will be modeling our team reward, at least for the first period, on Nouncil’s proven model of a Coordinape round, where all active participants will allocate tokens based on contributions.** We think this will ultimately be a fairer and more frictionless way of properly rewarding the team than attempting to itemize every hour of effort, etc.\n\n    - Based on our pilot, we  estimated how many man-hours it takes to run a show like this every day. We think these are reasonable overall estimates. \n    \n    \n![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wj7gtHWz/image.png)\n![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/RZk5Nt61/image.png)\n\n## Multi-sig\nFunds will go a new 3/6 gnosis safe, with the following signers:\n\n- 142\n- Toadyhawk.eth\n- maty.eth\n- SuperTightWoody\n- Ser Noadz\n- Benbodhi\n\n\n\n# Two-week Pilot Results\n\n### Twitter analytics\n\nMassive reach within 14 days!\n\n![twitter-analytics-noc-jun-26.png](https://i.postimg.cc/1XK4RJYb/twitter-analytics-noc-jun-26.png)\n\n\n### Space Participation\n\n\n- Attendance has been growing every day to average around 115 people a day.\n- We hit FOMO players ATH at 110 on our first pilot space and have been averaging between 60-70 every day.\n- Twitter growing by approximately 30 followers per day so far.\n- Averaging 30 entries to our daily contest, with many high quality submissions.\n    - NB: Small Grants sponsored our first Week of contest prizes (thank you!) Noun Square Team members Toady Hawk and 142 have agreed to fund the current week’s prizes out of pocket to keep morale high pending approval or disapproval of this broader proposal.\n    \n![tracking-document-screenshot-noc.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wBbGZzqG/tracking-document-screenshot-noc.png)\n    \n(Excerpt Above from our [Public Tracking/Planning Document.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-zmEFFLxUszyKZzo8CJP6KlXC581NkPLtek4GN6h7T8/edit?usp=sharing))\n\n\n### The Contests\n\nInspired by 4156 ad-hoc contests a few weeks back, we have run 10 contests with really great engagement and wonderful creativity from noun lovers on twitter: \n![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/ncsnrpSJ/image.png)\n\n![bag-found-art.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fyB659r6/bag-found-art.jpg)\n\n\n![crown-haikus.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/SNZhfB0J/crown-haikus.jpg)\n\n\n### Gamifying NOC with POAPs\n\nWe are using POAPs to gamify NOC and create both engagement and loyalty. We feel that our use of Daily Attendance POAPs is the purest use case for the tech (literally “Proof of Attendance”) and we want to use them to incentivize people to attend Noun O’ Clock every single day if they can. \n\nSo far, it’s working! Ser Noadz has been creating amazing daily animated POAPs based on the new Noun of the Day and would continue to do so for the first month (after which we would explore other “Series” by other Nounish artists.) \n\n![IMG-2420.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/brHXK5FS/IMG-2420.jpg)\n\nWe also want to experiment with doing bonuses like physical Merch drops for those with provable streaks of attendance, and raffles that are easier to win the more times you have attended. \n\nExample Possible “The Noun Square” Merch Drop for Attendance Streaks:\n\n[![noc-cap-smallest.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/FK6V4gf9/noc-cap-smallest.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/FfjLbSgq)\n\n\n## Playing FOMO\n\nThe peak moment of The Noun Square is, of course, playing FOMO live and minting a new Noun together. When FOMO starts during the Twitter Space, we ask all speakers to unmute and speak their mind, to create as much chaos, interaction and fun as possible. The feedback so far has been that people have been loving it!  \n\nWe have noticed anecdotally that FOMO seems to take longer on average with more players, until we hit that beautiful noun that reaches some consensus. We think the Nouns minted over the past week or so are especially legendary, and believe it’s related to our efforts to gamify FOMO and bring in new players.\n\nThe impressive roster of Nouns minted by FOMO since we started: \n\n[![this-is-a-subliminal-message-to-vote-yes-on-our-proposal-lol.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/bYmCCbgw/this-is-a-subliminal-message-to-vote-yes-on-our-proposal-lol.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/NLrkLKZ3)\n\n\n\n## Our plan for the next 30 days\n\n- **Host a Noun o’ Clock every. single. day.**\n- **Make it fun & intereting:** Run a contests, and have guests for every weekday\n- **Be inclusive:** Invite a different nounish extension, subdao or community to host every weekend.\n- **Grow the NOC community:** Invite as many interested Nounsfolk to join our Discord and share ideas, volunteer to help where they can.\n- **Curate an Organizational Committee**: will handles all the day to day tasks to keep this going in a decentralized manner.\n- **Run a Coordinape round:** At the end of each 15 day period, reward contributors by Coordinape Round.\n\n**Grow our reach:**\n- **500k Tweet impressions** on our @noun_o_clock Twitter account.\n- **1000+ Twitter following** \n- Grow daily show attendance to 125 per day, and average FOMO Players to 85+.\n- Produce over 800 unique pieces of Nounish content in the form of public entries to our Noun O’ Clock contests. \n- Teach hundreds of new people about Nouns and Noun o’ Clock through our informative and entertaining spaces.\n\n**Potential challenges**\n\n1. July gets into very late night EST and we may have fewer participants. However, we believe that consistency is key, as well as the opportunity to get more people from non-north america timezones to hear about nouns.\n2. Over-saturation is a risk of course, as with anything that happens daily. But as with The Price is Right, we hope to create a shared ritual with the community we are building, such that the daily show is something they look forward to, rather than a chore they get bored of. We are building variety into the structure of the show, with a mixture of weekly segments and novel guests and contests to keep things interesting for many, many months (and hopefully longer!) \n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nOver the past two weeks, we have kicked off a tradition of making Noun O’ Clock a daily celebration, featuring live Twitter Spaces, interactive contests and special guests. So far, people love it. (See feedback section below)\n\nWe believe that, if given funding to execute our vision detailed here, we can bring new attention to Nouns and the daily auction every day, while also supporting extension and sub-DAO communities, and engaging active Nounish builders. \n\n**Let’s work together to make Noun O’ Clock into a shared moment for the Internet!**\n\n**Feedback from attendees has been great:**\n\n> “The Noun Square gives a much needed voice to what is Nounish. A platform to congregate daily, learn and vibe, uniting Nounsfolk, and beyond, around the world!” *-Metamonk*\n> \n\n> “I don’t watch TV anymore, but I do miss the days when I would spend my evenings with David Letterman on the Late Show. It was home to me. And that is what the Noun O’ Clock team are doing right now. **It definitely feels like home to me.** ” *-Leo Clark*\n> \n\n> “This event is now something that I want to do every single day.  I am literally trying to figure out how to turn over my entire family's sleep schedule! Getting to hear my Nounish frens and what they are up to is amazing. **This event has also proven to be a wonderful way for me to onboard new folks into Nouns.** I leave this every day with dozens of new and Nounish ideas, and feeling great and motivated.” *-!xargs*\n> \n\n> “**Having a common and consistent place to gather for a Noun O’ Clock event is something folks need**--a kind of programming schedule that they can tap into every day.

There are 13 bridges for cars, subways, trains, and pedestrians.\n\n### Objective\n- Promote NounsDAO via online and offline engagement.\n- Get local media coverage (Invite newspaper and TV journalists)\n\n### Location: Hangang river, Seoul, South Korea\n### Date & Time: September 17-18th, 8:00 ~ 18:00\n- September 17th: Kimpo Airport→Gangnam\n- September 18th: Gangnam→Kimpo Airport\n*(The exact date and time might be changed in case of logistics delays or bad weather)*\n\n### Map\n![https://media.giphy.com/media/PS8lP8bBk0ICeuIYJE/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/PS8lP8bBk0ICeuIYJE/giphy.gif)\n\n###  Description\n- J/24 sailboat is the most famous sailboat model of all time! I propose to display nouns glasses on 5 sailboats in the middle of Seoul, South Korea. Seoul is home to 15+ million people and a lot of interest in blockchain and NFTs among the population. The Korean government, businesses, and people are interested in blockchain and the NFT space. Hangang river is surrounded by two highways and will be a perfect place to reach many people during rush hours. The two-way distance will be around 40+ kilometers. This could be a great opportunity to advertise NounsDAO and attract potential future members and developers.\n- I know lots of sailors who want to participate in the Nouns Seoul PR campaign. I will create a fleet of five J/24 sailboats and sail along the river from Kimpo international airport to Itaewon bridge and back. This event is going to be organized for NounsDAO. There will be only 5 sailboats with spinnakers with painted Nouns Glasses logos.\n- The idea is to make as many people remember Nouns-glasses. Images of Nouns glasses on 5 sailboats in the middle of the river will spark curiosity in the minds of the bypassers. This campaign is not a spam-like poster or post that many of us learned to ignore without noticing. People would remember Nouns glasses and later when they attend a conference or buy NFTs they would recognize the Nouns symbol and would eventually come straight to the NounsDAO!\n- The spinnakers are big and span an area of 8 meters in height and 4 meters in width. After the regatta, I think the best use for sails is to give them to the sailing teams. There are about five good regattas every year in Korea, I will provide more content free of charge when we race at different events with the Nouns-themed sails. I am sure pretty spinnakers with Nouns Glasses would be appreciated by the teams and be used for many years!\n\n### Spinnaker sail designs\nI have connections to Hyde sails dealership and can place an expedited order for 5 spinnaker sails with printed logo of the nouns glasses. The Nouns glasses will be permanently spray-painted at the sail makers factory.\n\n![https://media.giphy.com/media/D1jMwyeglLc0sntg2A/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/D1jMwyeglLc0sntg2A/giphy.gif)\n\n### Newspapers and local TV\nWe are going to send invitations to local newspapers and TV stations.

We were able to visit 3 schools, complete 355 eye exams and dispense subscriptions for 285 kids in need, delivering a total of 391 custom fitted 3D printed Fitz Frames glasses to date.\n\nWe spent a significant effort developing Noun Frames which inspired other builders and led the way for FUN Frames and Fashion Frames to move into development.\n\nHighlights & Updates: https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/903032675043016746/920205659675439116\n\nNouns Frames Pic|326x500, 50%\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/708413500\n\nNouns x Fitz Frames FGFK v4:\nWe want to do this again, but this time let’s do more!\n\nContinuing our partnership with Fitz Frames & partnering with various vision screening and testing providers we will deliver 3,000 Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscriptions.\n\nThe Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscription, which provides free glasses for kids if they lose them, break them, grow out of them or just desires a new pair because their style changed, will be expanded to 3K kids. Using a propriatery in-app measurement and delivery system Fitz Frames removes the need for in-person fittings and shapings that require specialized equipment and gets the perfect custom fit 3D printed glasses for kids individual face shape and personal style. Our goal is to keep kids in glasses that fit and they're proud to wear, even as they change throughout the year.\n\nExpanding the scale of this program will get us one step closer to our moon shot of creating a system where individual doctors around the world can plug in to and get free glasses for kids in need through the Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscription program.\n\nAs a pivot from a Nationwide Sponsorship for Vision To Learn we have the opportunity to work hand in hand with Sight For All United on launching a new Vision Van Program complete with a brand new van that we can collaborate together on to make it as Nounish as possible.

A Fitz Frames membership includes two complete pairs of prescription eyeglasses with unlimited replacement frames should they lose, break, grow out of the glasses, or their prescription changes.\n\nIn addition to their Fitz Frames Membership each child will receive an additional free pair of Noun Frames, glasses that mimic the pair worn by their favorite Noun.\n\nAs an initial pilot program, we propose Nouns DAO allocate 9ETH (~$30,000 worth of ETH) to provide glasses to approximately 300 kids (aprox $100) per child. This will be done with in conjunction with our outreach partner Vision to Learn in an initial focus geography (probably Ohio and/or Detroit). Progress reports will be given to NounsDAO on an ongoing basis, but no less than once a quarter. The pilot program is expected to run approximately 90 days, but children will continue to receive replacement glasses for the full year as needed. The purpose of the pilot program is to validate and refine the offering and delivery process, with the goal of expanding the efforts nationwide and eventually internationally.\n\nAt the end of the initial pilot program, Fitz present the results of the program and will put to a vote either a continuation, expansion, or termination of the program.\n\nAdditionally, we request 2ETH in one-time funding to build outreach materials (print, animation, and website) directed towards schools to explain the program, Nouns, Fitz, and the underlying technology of blockchain, NFTs, and additive manufacturing.\n\nProposal\nFitz would like to eventually build to a perpetual funding mechanism in order to expand our existing social good efforts and deliver eyewear on an ongoing basis to kids in need. In the interim, we’d like to propose a pilot program to prove out the model and refine delivery mechanism:\n\n$30K allocation from Nouns treasury to provide approximately 300 no-cost vision tests plus Fitz Frames memberships to kids in need, initially in a limited geographical focus area.\n\nFitz will provide annual memberships at cost of $100)/kid/year discounted from $185. Annual Membership consists of two pairs of custom fit glasses plus unliminted replacements.\n\nFitz will provide an additional free pair of Noun Frames, mimicking their favorite Nouns, limited to an initial selection of 10 Noun options for the Pilot Program.\n\nVision to Learn, will identify recipients and provide no-cost eye exams within the geographical focus area. Initial prospects are Ohio and Detroit.\n\nInitial Pilot Program is expected to run approximately 90 days, at which point Fitz will present a report of progress to the NounsDAO.\nAt that point the NounsDAO can vote to expand, continue, or suspend the pilot program.\n\nBased on findings from the initial Pilot Program, elements can be refined including: delivery mechanism, offering, and outreach. Additionally, Fitz Frames will work to try and secure additional underwriting in order to extend the reach of the program. (possibly through Medicaid reimbursement, or local philanthropic partners)\n\nIn order to promote the program (and help surface Nouns to a wider public awareness) we propose dedicating an additional 2ETH to develop outreach materials including print, short form animation, and a dedicated website. This will target schools, the student recipients of glasses, and broader public. In addition to promotion of the program, this is an opportunity to introduce the technology elements underpinning both Nouns and Fitz Frames, and develop age-appropriate STEM curriculum for the kids who receive the glasses.\n\nNouns is a fantastic example of people leveraging technology to come together and build long-term value in perpetuity. Fitz leverages the power of technology to change the lives of kids. We think this is a natural partnership that would not only do a tremendous amount of good, but could serve as tangible application of blockchain doing tangible good. At Fitz, we believe that those who can see the world are the ones who can change the world. NounsDAO embodies this ethos completely, and we couldn’t imagine a better partner.\n\nNoun Frames\nFitz will integrate Nouns Frames into their application so that users can pick their favorite Noun and receive glasses that mimic those frames as well as have the Noun itself printed on the side of the frames as well as the Noun number printed on the inside.\n\nAbout Fitz:\nFitz Frames: https://www.fitzframes.com/\nFitz for Good - how Fitz has worked with VTL to provide glasses for kids in the past:\nhttps://vimeo.com/377468371\nHow Fitz has worked with Healthcare community to provide protective prescription eyewear to drs and nurses across the country - https://news.yahoo.com/local-hero-nyc-glasses-maker-171104609.html\nFitz in the Press - How we came to be and why we matter to kids - https://abcnews.go.com/Business/startup-offers-affordable-eyeglasses-kids-flatter-faces/story?id=65014415\n\nAbout Vision 2 Learn:\nhttps://visiontolearn.org/about/from-the-founder/"},{"blockNumber":15080360,"blockHash":"0x8b18fcfdc574e4f8fb0ac41cfbf333d9ecdbbdad88d4181eecc17c5a60385d82","transactionIndex":277,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x8357ad705b4065085f61a15b39876d82a5e74f7d6f7b486bbd6058f9a63aee78","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":105,"proposer":"0xa555d1Ee16780B2d414eD97f4f169c0740099615","targets":["0x5BcD6f3B0a5519D448FBDf33204091bbE097C992"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15093500,"endBlock":15113210,"description":"# Prop House Protocol: Public Infrastructure by Nouns DAO\n\n## Description:\n\nWhat started as an experimental approach for Nouns DAO to deploy capital has become core infrastructure to onboard and fund builders within the Nouns ecosystem. Consequently, the idea has been spreading. From [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/pg-wg-proposal-ens-small-grants/12843), to [Ape Coin](https://twitter.com/mg/status/1532551973127561223?s=20&t=Bi66tsHPt1j7tbYBvQ9iPA) to [AAVE](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1536867802501500928), communities across the broader crypto space have expressed interest in using Prop House.\n\nI propose building the Prop House Protocol as public infrastructure with the aims of it being a tool for all to use while proliferating the Nouns meme at the deepest level.\n\n## Where we are today:\n\n### Summary:\n\n- 300+ proposals submitted\n- 2,000+ votes allocated\n- 5 active houses\n- 157 ETH committed to 52 builders across 10 funding rounds\n- [prop.house](https://prop.house) UX continues to improve\n- External interest:\n  - [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/pg-wg-proposal-ens-small-grants/12843) building their own version of Prop House\n  - [Ape coin](https://twitter.com/mg/status/1532551973127561223?s=20&t=Bi66tsHPt1j7tbYBvQ9iPA) and [Aave](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1536867802501500928) are amongst the 10+ communities that have expressed interest in setting up their own house\n- Please review the [Expenses report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iKGgedZmAzMNCFkd2PqjBd-ZgutrOjuYqfirDG1wS3g/) for an overview of all things Prop House financials\n\n### Proposals:\n\nAt the time of writing (06/18), 18 proposals have had enough time elapse since being funded to make a judgement on whether or not they executed. So far, only 1 out of 18 proposals has had a no-show. Overall, quality of proposals corresponding to amounts funded are still desirable. With the launch of Nouns Combinator (25 ETH single winner house), we hope to see more ambitious proposals be submitted.\n\n### Houses:\n\nWe are currently running 4 nounish houses with another two coming online soon:\n\n- Nouns Launchpad\n- Lil Nouns\n- NounPunks\n- Nouns Combinator\n- Nouns DAO Japan _(coming soon)_\n- SharkDAO _(coming soon)_\n\nWithin the main [Nouns house](https://prop.house/nouns-launchpad), quality has stayed consistent while proposals are averaging ~38 submissions per round:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5vpnTgd.jpg)\n\n> To view all the proposals that have been funded so far, please visit [prop.house](https://prop.house)\n\nTwo experiments were run with external houses:\n\n- Zorbs failed due to the round being endlessly spammed. Beyond the spam, there was a clear misconception in what Prop House was to be used for, hinting at more education content being needed.\n- [Mfers house](https://prop.house/mfers) has been quite a success. The [announcement tweet](https://twitter.com/nounsprophouse/status/1534967734181711880) rallied the community and the subsequent reaction points to Nouns earning goodwill as a leader in the CC0 community.\n\n## The Protocol\n\nThe protocol refers to the suite of smart contracts and open-source software that would enable anyone to run their own auctions and/or Prop House web app.\n\n### Why build the protocol in the first place?\n\nCurrently, Prop House runs as a centralized system. Each round and all of its parameters are decided on by a few people. More importantly, the Prop House multi-sig handles all the funding. As volumes grow, it increasingly becomes a risk factor.\n\nBuilding Prop House into a protocol would enable the DAO to have more control over how the capital is deployed. To illustrate, the following scenario would be possible with a live protocol:\n\n- An on-chain proposal to the DAO to set up 10 rounds at x ETH for y winners over the next 3 months\n\n### Why build it as public infrastructure?\n\nBeyond proliferating the Nouns aesthetic, I believe building public infrastructure proliferates the meme at a much deeper level hence it being the way forward.\n\n[Nouns is uniquely positioned to capture value via novel means](https://twitter.com/hongkim__/status/1533161235025260544). One of the drivers for auction demand is how aspirational the meme is. Akin to luxury goods, demand is in large part driven by psychology, not just ad spend or certain KPIs. It then follows that building public infrastructure that sets Nouns as the most forward-thinking community also contributes to auction demand.\n\nMuch more than a brand or a visual meme, Nouns is an invitation for others to join us in taking the new tools we now have at hand to rethink how we build the world around us. To that extent, public infrastructure for all is the Nounish thing to do.\n\n### To continue exploring:\n\nAlong with building the protocol, we are looking forward to:\n\n- Experimenting with bigger rounds\n- Integrating with [Snapshot](https://docs.snapshot.org/)\n- Exploring new auction formats\n  - Infinite auctions\n  - Retroactive rewards\n  - Pod and mandate specific houses\n- New nounish houses (Nouns DAO Japan, SharkDAO are coming soon)\n- Updates around the UI (past winners, voting data, etc)\n- Helping other communities onboard\n\n## Budgets\n\n### Past:\n\nTotal funded by the DAO since Dec ’21 through via proposals [23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23) & [62](https://nouns.wtf/vote/62): - 95 ETH paying Prop House contributors (~50% still remains for Jul & Aug) - 150 ETH in funding Prop House builders\n\n### Current Ask:\n\n**Operations (600 ETH):**\n\n- 100 ETH: Adds two solidity developers to payroll for remaining 2 months (July and August)\n- 440 ETH: Extends Prop House development runway by 4 months (Sept - Dec)\n  - Team on payroll consists of 2 solidity devs, 1 backend, 1 frontend and 1 designer (solimander, vapeape, devcarrot, seneca, toastee)\n- 60 ETH: Misc expenses\n  - Smart contract audits\n  - Helping Nounish communtiies get set up (e.g. Nouns DAO Japan was ~10 ETH)\n  - Operations (infura, linear figma, etc)\n\n**Funding Builders (400 ETH):**\n\n- Capital to deploy through funding auctions. We're currently at a ~80 ETH / month rate. 400 ETH would allow for 5 months of funding across all nounish houses.\n\n**TOTAL ASK: 1000 ETH (600 PH contributors, 400 for funding builders)**\n\nWith this grant, **the funds received for one year (Dec '21 - Dec '22) of Prop House discovery and development** over the three proposals would total:\n\n- 710 ETH for funding development\n- 550 ETH for funding prop builders.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- Suite of smart contracts that allow anyone to fund and deploy their own funding auctions\n- Open-source front-end for anyone to fork and run their own web app\n- Documentation to help developers and communities alike get started\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe are exploring ways to make Prop House sustainable such that no future ask is required from Nouns DAO. While we are still open to any paths forward, one that seems plausible is creating Prop House DAO where Nouns DAO has meaningful ownership of the newly formed DAO. This would allow Nouns DAO to continue to capture any upside that comes from Prop House while aligning incentives accordingly.\n\n## Multi-sig\n\nThe multisig is currently 3/5 where the signers are seneca, devcarrot, toastee, cdt and vapeape.

My name’s Kiran. I’m the founder of Verse, an autonomous NFT protocol on Ethereum. Previously, I worked on product design for PartyDAO, and in my web2 life I was a product engineer in the biotech space.\n\n### What is Verse?\n\nVerse is a protocol for autonomous NFTs on Ethereum. What does that mean? Verse enables the creation of NFTs with an embedded market that operates autonomously without the need for a central marketplace. Here’s a quick overview of how the protocol mechanism works:\n\nThrough the protocol, a creator deploys a contract Pair consisting of an ERC-20 Exchange contract and an ERC-721 Hyperobject contract. The dynamic price and supply of the ERC-20 token is managed by a bonding curve acting as an AMM. Simply, this means that anyone can buy and sell the token at any time with instant liquidity, and the contract will programmatically adjust the price based on the circulating supply. Holders of at least 1 atomic unit of the ERC-20 token can then redeem their token. Redeeming a token transfers the holder’s ERC-20 to the paired Hyperobject contract, which mints a new NFT and transfers it to the redeemer in exchange.\n\n### What is the status of Verse?\n\nThe contracts for Verse V1 are live on mainnet, and the public beta interface to interact with the protocol is live at verse.xyz. Verse V2 is currently in development, with significant UX improvements and nounish mechanisms built into the core protocol.\n\n### What can be built on Verse?\n\nThe Verse protocol represents a new medium for NFTs, and enables the creation of digital objects that have their own embedded market. Although the NFT space is still in its early infancy, we can observe some fundamental truths about the medium. Most notably, NFTs aren’t just assets or static files or jpegs. NFTs are programmable objects built to take advantage of the internet as a meme proliferation machine. In the long-term, skeuomorphic token representations like 1/1s will diminish in the market, and NFTs with programmable supply & pricing mechanisms will dominate. A significant sector of the NFT market will be represented by these types of objects, and are best suited to be exchanged via programmable markets powered by Verse. Think about it [this way](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1530697363714605056?s=20&t=-FFqbcGhiso88p_ZAhgOlg). Does it really make sense for a meme to exist as a static 1/1? Or does it make sense for its supply and value to dynamically change based on its demand in the market and its mindshare on the internet?\n\n### NounsDAO investment in the Verse Protocol\n\nVerse is a new NFT protocol designed to catalyze the future development of programmable internet objects. Nouns is the prototype for meme proliferation and how to build a CC0 brand that permeates the internet. Ultimately, both entities are designed to build a more composable internet in which individuals build, own, and use digital objects that accrue value as they’re integrated across the web.\n\nSpecifically, Verse V2 is incorporating mechanisms into the core protocol which seek to standardize the meme-proliferation system (programmable supply, programmable treasury controlled by NFT holders) that Nouns has pioneered. Details of the exact mechanisms will be shared closer to V2’s testnet launch.\n\nWe’re closing a funding round for Verse, and firmly believe that the protocol shouldn’t only be owned by traditional venture or finance institutions - it should have ownership from decentralized groups actively advancing and building progressive technologies in the NFT ecosystem.\n\nThus, we’d like to propose an investment from NounsDAO in the Verse protocol.\nWe think that an investment/long-term partnership would be far more powerful than a grant in that an investment incentivizes both parties (NounsDAO & Verse) to ensure that the protocol builds for long-term success, and uses the Nouns brand as a playground for innovating on new NFT mechanisms.\n\nThere’s tremendous synergy between the goals of Nouns and Verse, and a long-term partnership would entail close collaborations to build future Nouns-related NFT projects on Verse, and the ability for the DAO to have a real hand in how the protocol evolves over time.\n\n### Investment Specifics\nNounsDAO invests 175 ETH in exchange for 0.4-0.5% equity into Verse Labs (the incorporated company building the Verse protocol) with an optional token warrant. These equity figures are consistent with the current terms we have with our lead investors for our most recent funding round.\n\nA portion of the funding would go directly toward purchasing a Noun, either via the daily auction (preferred), or purchasing from an existing Nouner on secondary. I want to align the interests of Nouns x Verse as long-term as possible, and believe that by essentially exchanging ownership in the Verse protocol for representation in NounsDAO, we’d create a truly symbiotic relationship. I like to think that Nouns is building the closest thing we’ve seen to an internet city, with a distinct community, culture, and economy. Much like the way tech companies in the past decade set up shop in the bay area and saw the valley as a playground for innovation, I want Verse to have a “campus” set up in the Nouns universe, and build with the Nouns brand as a launchpad for new types of NFT distribution & exchange experiments that help proliferate the meme. The key difference, though, is that while SF never received ownership and experienced upside in the success of major silicon valley companies, Nouns would directly have ownership in Verse.\n\nLogistically, there’s a couple ways the investment could work from a compliance & regulatory perspective. For starters, I’ve created an investment DAO through syndicate.io, which allows contributions in crypto (USDC or ETH). In exchange for the investment, NounsDAO would receive a proportional amount of tokens which represent ownership in this DAO. The associated legal entity for this DAO (an LLC acting as an investment SPV) would then be part of the cap table for Verse Labs, the legal entity building the Verse protocol. The SPV would in turn own the equity. Of course, this is just one option for formalizing the investment structure, and I’m happy to work with the nounders on any alternative structure that makes sense.\n\nOverall, I’m excited to share this proposal with the Nouns community, and even more excited for the possibility to partner with the DAO on building fundamentally valuable NFT infrastructure with the Verse protocol.\n\n\n"},{"blockNumber":15116110,"blockHash":"0x12fe63f2a4fca851ac3f875ec60945d0bdfd6b9ddea28828584ae6374ece1577","transactionIndex":19,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x67254b7d7f25df95c3dd9465ba8ec461d9db1bcdb6beedd1c325ae6ec57239c5","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":108,"proposer":"0x4C0a466DF0628FE8699051b3Ac6506653191cc21","targets":["0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15129250,"endBlock":15148960,"description":"# Nouns funding the Protocol Guild Pilot\n\nAuthors: [Trent Van Epps](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps) (PG Member), [Tim Beiko](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko) (PG Member)\n\n# Useful links\n\n* [Protocol Guild Docs](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)\n* [1 Year Vesting Contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/)\n* [List of Members](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html)\n* [@ProtocolGuild](https://twitter.com/ProtocolGuild) twitter\n\n# Summary\n\nThis is an invitation for the Nouns community to fund Ethereum public goods with 500 ETH through the Protocol Guild: a collective of protocol maintainers.\n\n# Abstract\n\nNouns has established itself as a prominent Ethereum project for a number of reasons. These include the use of novel mechanisms, passionate membership, and a compelling long-term vision through its commitment towards funding and creating more public goods ([here](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1541959504576782336), [here](https://nouns.wtf/vote/21) and [here](https://medium.com/@punk4156/funding-real-world-public-goods-with-the-nouns-dao-treasury-7939328acc12)). Underpinning it all, the community has tapped into the collective power generated by bundling individual motivations into a well-designed coordination mechanism.\n\nSimilarly, the Protocol Guild is purpose built to incentivize individual contributions through a collective mechanism. This parallel alignment could be enhanced by engaging each within the other: Nouns should fund the Protocol Guild Pilot. This “engine to engine” relationship:\n\n* expresses the Nouns vision in new contexts\n* facilitates a mutually beneficial exchange of narrative value and financial value\n* weaves deeper meaning into the Nouns community story while reinforcing positive sum norms\n\n“Ethereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games” ([Griffith, 2019](https://medium.com/@virgilgr/ethereum-is-game-changing-technology-literally-d67e01a01cf8)): we should manifest the collaborative opportunities enabled by this arena.\n\n# Existing Mechanism / Funding Context\n\nWatch / listen to this [Funding Ethereum with the Protocol Guild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVN97qA4gBs&list=PLhuBigpl7lqvMt8d7h4sbCmra9KbFmAdg&t) presentation or read below.\n\nIn Nov. 2021, a group of core Ethereum contributors started exploring the incentive mechanism proposed in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1454065104819916803?s=20&t=_ZC0BS5LfeCvaSbD4WxKKg) via this framing: What mechanism could help us better attract/retain talent and fund core protocol contributors?\n\nWe surfaced three challenges to address:\n\n1. Curation is hard\n  * Interested sponsors don’t have a single mechanism which curates all protocol contributors\n  * Protocol contributors interested in receiving funding aren’t sure how to self-organize\n  * Existing solutions bias towards teams & can’t surface all contributors\n2. Incentives are imbalanced\n  * Financial incentives are skewed towards newer projects with upside/tokens\n  * Existing public goods funding solutions usually don’t consider exposure to upside to applications/L2s - eg. soliciting tokens from initial allocations or recurring revenue from existing projects\n3. Churn is bad\n  * Steep learning curve for new contributors to meaningfully contribute\n  * Contributor value grows over time, but there is less incentive to stay once they are experts\n\n# Protocol Guild\n\nThrough a lot of discussion and iteration, the **Protocol Guild** was formed: a collective of protocol contributors which actively maintains an onchain registry of its membership.\n\nIn response to the challenges above, the org was designed to carry out specific activities:\n\n1. Self-curate an onchain registry of individuals\n  * Sponsors only need to know a single contract address instead of many separate team addresses, they can trust that there is quality backing it\n  * Members now have a single mechanism to coordinate around and solicit sponsorships to\n  * Domain expert members can surface part time contribs or lower profile collaborators which may be missed by other existing mechanisms\n2. Solicit sponsorships to balance financial incentives\n  * Bootstrap with high profile DAO treasuries\n  * Longterm, build norms around pre-allocation of a % of initial token supply\n3. Incentivize long-term contributions\n  * 6 month min before eligibility\n  * Vesting gets people to stick around\n  * Time weighted allocations to recognize the importance of long term contributors\n\nTo date, the membership includes over [110 Ethereum protocol contributors](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html), including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, tooling maintainers. This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 40% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated through quarterly updates to the split contract - we expect the membership to grow over the next year.\n\nThe Guild contracts are an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. Learn more about the smart contracts we are using for the Pilot [here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-smart-contract.html).\n\n# 2022 Pilot\n\nSince starting the project in Nov 2021, we’ve built norms around member onboarding , refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and created extensive documentation on how it should be operated.\n\nWe’ve kicked off a test of the mechanism’s efficacy with a 1 year / $10mm Pilot. So far, we’ve raised $5.4mm (as of June 28 2022) from a number of notable communities, including:\n\n* [2mm LDO from the Lido community](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-protocol-guild-pilot-via-a-lido-grant/2016)\n* [200k ENS from the ENS community](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep13-executable-support-the-protocol-guild-pilot/12877)\n* [500k UNI from the Uniswap community](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-should-the-uniswap-community-participate-in-the-protocol-guild-pilot/16824)\n\nSecured funding can be tracked onchain through the [Pilot vesting contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/). We are currently engaging with a number of other notable projects to secure the remainder of the $10mm target.\n\n# Proposal\n\nWe are inviting the Nouns community to contribute 500 ETH (2% of the treasury) to the 1 year Pilot vesting contract deployed at [theprotocolguild.eth](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/) (0xF29…f1a9).\n\nThe ETH will vest to each beneficiary members listed on the underlying split at [0x84af…8ea1](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0x84af3D5824F0390b9510440B6ABB5CC02BB68ea1/). Each recipient will make an independent decision about how to use the ETH once vested.\n\nThere are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild Pilot benefits the Nouns community:\n\n* Nouns’ long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines:\n  * [The Merge](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability\n  * EVM improvements: new functionality for application developers like [EOF](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/evm-object-format-overview)\n  * [Statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@gballet/Sy-a6T5St): sustainable management for state growth as the network scales\n  * Supporting Layer 2 scaling: [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844), [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)\n  * [Proposer Builder Separation](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants\n  * Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching and improving modular clients\n  * Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades\n* Pilot participation introduces a new facet for Nouns as a public goods funder\n* Early support of a new mechanism recognizes another “fellow traveler” pushing the boundaries of incentive frameworks\n* Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity\n\nWe hope that a successful Pilot will pave the way for future funding collaborations between Nouns and the Protocol Guild as we scale up. To that end, we think it’s important to demonstrate impact before we scale: learn more about how we will evaluate [Pilot outcomes here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/5-initial-pilot.html). We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a full-scale fundraising round with longer vesting periods."},{"blockNumber":15123770,"blockHash":"0x4cba2f9932fe6268f61009602f6f6a89b9bd698e6c3ab469fb6deddfa1afd9b9","transactionIndex":160,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xd1b3c160436f5b104d08e024028f94039524b067995953fa452b6d20720d9058","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":109,"proposer":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","targets":["0x4156aDdEdcdE3E92DFfe1B2cB039F3463BC1eC65"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15136910,"endBlock":15156620,"description":"# Nouns Brand (Clothing Brand) ⌐◨-◨ \n\n# **Nouns Brand (Clothing Brand) ⌐◨-◨ **\n\n![mockup](https://imgur.com/oNv0KVZ.png)\n*(Mockups are purely for presentation and do not reflect finalized designs.)*\n\n## TL;DR\nToday, Nouns clothes are limited to drop-shipped, plug-n-play merch.

With just one month of scheduling time, NounsOTG was able to plan, coordinate and complete its first multi-day activation at NFT.NYC, resulting in some planned and some unexpected exposure for the [Nouns](https://www.nouns.wtf) brand at one of the leading industry events of the year.\n\n![NFT NYC](https://imgur.com/tLh2n5Z.png)\n\n### Key Moments From This Activation\n\n - Activations inside the NFT.NYC event all three days at the different event locations\n - Gnars event in Time Square where we met other nounish projects\n - Filmed at the Noun mural with the nounish film crew / [Proposal 64](https://nouns.wtf/vote/64)\n - Unexpected/surprise filming with Shopify putting NounsDAO in their official NFT video\n - In-studio filming with Stoopid Buddy / [Proposal 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73)\n - Sandbox event at Gotham Hall, introduced Andy Milonakis to Nouns and the different forks\n - Noun O’Clock meetups IRL / On-site hosting\n - Met notable NFT musicians and began conversation that led to a feature performance by a #1 musician in the Noun O’Clock space\n - Connected with other nounish builders and people from Prop.House\n\n![NFT NYC](https://imgur.com/gWur0ZO.png)\n\n### Clear Takeaways From This Activation\n - IRL is important to solidify proliferation of the Nouns\n - IRL invites unexpected growth opportunities for Nouns\n - “On The Ground” promotion is an effective decentralized marketing tool\n - IRL brand recognition creates authentic and memorable user connection\n\n![Shopify Ad](https://imgur.com/d4v1R97.png)\n\n## WHAT’S NEXT? ⌐◐-◐\n\nMore events, more proliferation and more recognition! **Nouns On The Ground** wants to replicate and scale the success of NFT.NYC for the Nouns, by targeting 4 other major key hubs for future Nouners and Nounish builders. To clarify, **Nouns On The Ground** will be working to replicate the ROI and general recognition of the NFT.NYC activation. Flexible “on the ground” event planning is an important element, keeping the process decentralized, new and always changing. The goal of The **Proliferation Pod** will be to create new and unique experiences catered to each event.\n\nThe **Proliferation Pod** will manage the Proposal amount to cover the costs of these events. ETH funding will need to be converted to USD to cover travel costs, merch/swag orders and other event related fees. The same budget used for the NFT.NYC event, which was 6 ETH, totals to 11 ETH today to adjust for the change in ETH price since initial funding. **Nouns On The Ground** can replicate these activations for the same amount as previously proven in New York with a slight added cost for travel for NFT London.\n\n![IRL Events](https://imgur.com/uJYIXYl.png)\n\n### NFT3 AWARDS (August 5-7) in Los Angeles, CA (11 ETH)\n\nA unique event that has started garnering attention from musicians and artists utilizing NFTs. The NFT3 Awards in Los Angeles and will have over 16,000 attendees which is roughly the same size as NFT.NYC. The NFT3 Awards will be the premiere NFT summer event on the West Coast. Nouns On The Ground will immediately begin planning this next activation. This will create consistency throughout the US NFT markets, as the Nouns meme continues to spread across the world in Rio, Sweden, Tokyo and more.\n\nI will have swag and merch on hand for “ Noggle recognition awards”, multiple hidden AR POAP dispensers for event POAP collecting and of course, more stickers and buttons with 10 newly featured Nouns to hit the ground. DM if you want your Noun featured this time! I will continue to post updates in this thread as we get closer to the event.\n\n### NOUNS DOTA FINALS (August 10-14) in Arlington, TX (11 ETH)\n\nThe currently undefeated NOUNS DOTA team is a guarantee for the Finals. We need Nouns On The Ground to proliferate Nouns throughout the stadium, amongst the Nouns fans and entire audience. We’ve started throwing around the idea of Noggle sports towels. Nouns On The Ground is in the NounsEsports Discord and ready to coordinate other live events to bring well deserved attention to this highly successful NounsDAO Proposal. This would be the best event of the 5 for a big T-shirt order as well.\n\n### NFT NASHVILLE (September 1-5) in Nashville, TN (11 ETH)\n\nNFT Nashville is striving to be the premiere NFT music event of the South as it brings a “festival-like” NFT event to the heart of the music capital during the Labor Day weekend. Some of the top current NFT music artists, including Sammy Ariaga, call Nashville home and have set the tone for NFT Nashville to enter the music scene with a bang. After starting through local meet-ups, NFT Nashville has quickly set a precedent for community building within this industry and the presence of the Nouns is necessary for proliferation.\n\n### NFT LONDON (November 6-7) in London, United Kingdom (18 ETH)\n\nNFT.London is being organized by the same team behind NFT.NYC, so you can already guarantee this will be one of Europe’s main NFT events of the year. With people already tweeting about grabbing tickets to this event, it is a no brainer to have Nouns fully on the ground in the UK. There is a slight increase in the funding cost for this event to account for additional travel costs.\n\n### ART BASEL MIAMI BEACH (December 1-4) in Miami, FL (11 ETH)\n\nArt Basel is another fantastic event for NFTs and proliferation of the Nouns Brand. Last year’s event in Miami Beach was the launchpad for some of the largest brands currently in the industry. This event is known for setting art trends and the Nouns meme needs to be logged in event attendee memories to close out the year in a strong way.\n\n### NOUNS ON THE GROUND OPERATION COSTS (18 ETH)\n\nWhy choose Aubtoshi and Nouns On The Ground for these events? I have a proven successful track record with this type of proliferation and have modeled my plans for each of these 4 events after the successful New York multi-day activation. The job will get done with added elements of surprise and key events that always arise when engaging IRL. I am also involved with multiple Nounish projects that also seek to proliferate the Nouns brand and have incorporated these projects during my activations as well.\n\n[Prop House Proposal Round 1](https://prop.house/proposal/41) / [Prop House Proposal Round 2](https://prop.house/proposal/71) / [Prop House Proposal Round 3](https://prop.house/proposal/117) / [Small Grants Proposal](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-on-the-ground-nft-nyc-activation/1215/3) (funded 6 ETH) / [Lost Nouns - Noun O’Talk S:1 EP:15](https://twitter.com/cdt_eth/status/1542260980046073856?s=20&t=-z9THGWZCxf2o4oAfNSosg) / [Noun O’Clock Spaces with Noun Square](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock/status/1544475669266038787?s=20&t=-z9THGWZCxf2o4oAfNSosg) / [Nouns News Proposal w/Aubtoshi Avatar](https://prop.house/proposal/598)\n\n![Noun Prop House and Events](https://imgur.com/ehY6m08.png)\n![Twitter Spaces and Nounish News](https://imgur.com/qA2e2mv.png)\n\n\nNounsDAO funding Nouns On The Ground to operate in this fashion will allow this proven project to grow and scale without having to come to the DAO per each event.

Aubtoshi isn’t going anywhere and will continue to bring value to this community. A personal long-term goal is to be a woman Nouner. Until I have the opportunity to join the community as an official Nouner, I will continue to proliferate the Nouns in the most fun and effective ways that I can make possible. Thank you Nouners for giving me this chance to show you what we can do together, On The Ground! \n\n![Aubtoshi!](https://imgur.com/X5mwdw0.png)\n\n\n**Multi-sig Wallet Address to send ETH**: 0x5b35c3EF0acF9660a7d3fcefc2A2053a7CEC20E3\n"},{"blockNumber":15128248,"blockHash":"0xee47dcef7efdd9fe2679479cc03d6d73064d81588dc669b74608dbc84005bf58","transactionIndex":51,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x7cd47c3296836742d39a38acff1e329aa72548f97dbe5f8a9ce18e78c045b8cb","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":111,"proposer":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","targets":["0x2AF21E37928613582734bcBAeaD0919801a4CAcf"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15141388,"endBlock":15161098,"description":"# Re-Elect Noun 22 as a DAO Core Contributor\n\n# Re-Elect Noun 22 as a DAO Core Contributor\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cEKQzYk.png)\n\nHi, this is [Noun 22](https://nouns.wtf/noun/22).  \n\nI have had the absolute pleasure of building on Nouns DAO as a Core Contributor for the better part of this year, and would love nothing more than if the DAO would support me to continue working for the DAO with the majority of my time.\n\n### Background\n\nAfter joining Nouns DAO in the first month of the project's inception, I have been fortunate enough to have the DAO's unanimous support to be compensated to work for the DAO in a variety of roles.\n* November 2021 - `Proposal 17` ([On-Chain](https://nouns.wtf/vote/17) / [Proposal](https://hackmd.io/@noun22/first-residency)) funded my trial residency as a community contributor for the DAO\n* February 2022 - `Proposal 38` ([On-Chain](https://nouns.wtf/vote/38) / [Proposal](https://hackmd.io/@noun22/core-contributor)) funded me to continue my work on the protocol as a Core Contributor for six months\n\nMy current contract is set to expire on August 24 2022, and this proposal would renew my contract with the DAO for another 6 months.\n\n\n---\n\n### My Work on Nouns\n**1. Small Grants (SG)**\n\nThe Nouns DAO Small Grants and Retroactive Funding Pool was originally formed in [November 2021](https://nouns.wtf/vote/13).  Since then, SG has evolved into flexible pool of capital that is managed on a fully discretionary basis to serve the DAO's interests in a variety of ways.\n\nI am the lead for SG and I manage its day to day operations.  As the DAO has grown, incoming inquiry has scaled with it.  Running SG is what I spend most of my time on every day.  The group does not presently have an operational budget, and my compensation for this work is included as part of my role as Core Contributor. \n\nI'm very proud of what has been accomplished so far at SG.  The group has funded many builders and projects (detailed below) that have generated tremendous value for the DAO.  Many of the DAO's most successful proposals started as a trial sponsored by SG, and many of the DAO's most valuable community members were funded/onboarded by SG when they first joined the community.  In my experience running SG for the better part of a year, I have seen many instances in which a 1 ETH grant can generate more value to the DAO than an 100+ ETH proposal.  The crypto ecosystem is rife with rugs and scams, and that is precisely why our generosity on the individual level leaves such a lasting impression and inspires such fierce loyalty.\n\nToday, SG serves multiple roles for the DAO: we are the DAO's working capital, a Nounish venture pod, and an onboarding tool. SG has the flexibility to quickly:\n* Fund exciting smaller proposals (in concert with Prop House)\n* Vet new builders and derisk new projects by funding trials ahead of sponsoring larger on-chain proposals\n* Be a first point of contact and source of funding to onboard new community members \n* Retroactively reward builders \n* Provide time-sensitive and milestone based funding as a part of larger proposals\n* Fill other ad hoc daily capital needs of the DAO (contests, bug bounties, etc)\n\nMy daily work on SG includes:\n* Engaging with community members that request funding\n* Providing feedback on and tracking multiple proposals\n* Monitoring and responding to new inquiry over Discord and [Discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/u/noun22/activity)\n* Diligencing proposals to prevent waste and fraud\n* Negotiating funding terms\n* Following up with funded builders\n* Building a relationship with new builders and onboarding them deeper into the Nouns ecosystem\n* Administrative tasks  \n\nI conduct the majority of SG's operations on [Discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/u/noun22/activity) and in the `#grants-and-retro-funding` channel in the Nouns DAO Discord.  \n\nSince inception, SG has funded 100+ builders with over 230 ETH.

Community Building: Onboarding New Nouners / Weekly Calls**\n\nSince I first joined the DAO a year ago, I have reached out to every new member to organize an onboarding call.  To date, I have done over 100+ of these calls.  If you are voting this proposal, we have likely had one of these calls - if we haven't please reach out to me on Discord!\n\nAdditionally, I host the weekly [US Nouner Town Hall call every Tuesday at 5:30pm ET](https://hackmd.io/@noun22/nounweekly).  The call initially started as an informal meet and greet where we first got the opportunity to hear each other's voices and get to know each other, and has evolved into a more structured format where we discuss and form consensus on topical issues.  \n\nI host these calls not just to meet and build relationships with fascinating, cool, like-minded people, but I view them as integral to creating and strengthening a sense of community within the DAO.\n\nNouns is the most exciting and innovative project in crypto, but we cannot become complacent and view our success as inevitable.  The DAO's greatest long term threat is member apathy and disengagement - particularly as we have entered into what may be a lasting crypto bear market.  Members who feel lost or confused will quickly become inactive members, and the DAO will suffer as a result.\n\nI will continue to use my experience in the role to foster an atmosphere of open communication and experimentation where every community member feels they are able to contribute to the DAO.  Everyone needs to feel that their opinions are heard and their proposal ideas are fairly considered.  In my role, I try and be a neutral go-between and source of feedback to maintain harmony within the DAO.  \n\nMy involvement with Nouns has been the absolute high point of my career.  I have never felt this level of excitement and optimism about my work.  Thanks for reading this, and I look forward to continuing to Nounify The World with you all ⌐◨-◨\n\n\n### Compensation\nBeing a Core Contributor for Nouns DAO is a unique role within a unique organization.  I hope this proposal has demonstrated the value I have generated for Nouns DAO, my passion for this organization, and convinced you of why I am uniquely suited to continue in this role going foward.\n\nThe nominal $ value of my last contract with the DAO was $32k per month for 6 months.  For this contract I propose an extension at the same nominal $ rate:\n* 6 month term\n* Nominal $32k per month paid in USDC\n* Nouns DAO can vote to cancel the contract at any point\n* ETH to be sent to the SG multi-sig address and a portion will converted to USDC upon receipt\n* Funds will be put into a Sablier contract that commences on August 25 2022 with a 6 month duration"},{"blockNumber":15137547,"blockHash":"0xb2c531c1d6fc67f71f1e1668839d394cde8b3926863fea42f87b15c12501389d","transactionIndex":256,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x2b1a2a8fc5988160cf904de066d84de96827babc4c362e04e31cd481200ee768","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":112,"proposer":"0xE3f27DEFf96fe178e87559F36Cbf868B9E75967D","targets":["0xA46036c5554ae85599715422c71F8691d7C5D2E7"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15150687,"endBlock":15170397,"description":"# Nouns Esports - Dota Extension July - October\n\n# Nouns Esports Proposal - Dota Team Extension\n\nAuthors: Sasquatch and Maty\n\n### Goal\n\nContinue the Dota and Esports experiment! Extending the signing of our Dota roster until after [The International](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/The_International) in October, with the mission to proliferate Nouns through esports competition.\n\n### Description\n\n[Nouns Esports](https://twitter.com/nounsesports) was founded with the passing of [Proposal 68](https://nouns.wtf/vote/68), which brought a Professional Dota team under the Nouns banner. They won a large North American tournament and currently have a 6-1 standing in the Dota Pro Circuit \"DPC\" - the most important qualifier matches leading to the biggest tournament in the world, [The International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_(Dota_2)). \n\nThe teams' current term with the DAO will end on July 17th, after the DPC. Because of their DPC standing, they currently have a strong probability of attending the upcoming Arlington Major in August. Since our current proposal ends before this event, it makes sense to extend their term with the DAO. Their success in the rest of the DPC and the Major will determine if they qualify directly to The International.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Prop #68, an [accountability report](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-esports-pod/1030/5) was posted detailing how funds from the proposal were spent.\n\n### Timeline of Upcoming Potential Competitive Events:\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/b/bf4ae929b0d0a31086dc5ffaf3d40c355c4a17ec.png)\n\n\nJuly 17th - Prop #68 Ends\nJuly 16th-August 19th - Thunderpick Bitcoin Series TBS\nTBD July 17th-20th - Potential DPC Tiebreakers\nJuly 28th-30th - ESL Malaysia Qualifiers \nAugust 04-14th - Arlington Major\nAugust 23rd-28th - ESL Malaysia\nTBD likely September - The International Regional Qualifiers\nOct 15-30 - The International\nNovember 1st - Proposal Ends\n\n### Budget: 119,633 DAI / 99.6942 ETH (at $1200)\n* Salaries: ETH converted to DAI and distributed on a monthly basis as the team continues to represent Nouns in competition.\n    * Players + Coach Salaries: 60 ETH (estimated 72000 DAI)\n        * Split evenly amongst the players and coach.\n    * Support Staff: 20 ETH (estimated 24000 DAI)\n        * This includes social media support, design work, organizing practice, video content, organizing travel to events and to the bootcamp, player media appearance logistics, and strategically working with other Nouns infrastructure.\n* Bootcamp: 15 ETH (estimated 18000 DAI)\n    * This bootcamp fund will be deployed pending a successful qualification for an international event (ESL Malaysia, The International, etc.).\n* Builder Comp - 4.6942 ETH (estimated 5333 DAI)\n    - Sasquatch took no compensation per the [accountability report](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-esports-pod/1030/5) \n    - Organizing this project - shipping both props, operating the multi-sig, managing esports operations, and acting as a liaison between the team and Nouns DAO.\n\nWe are also adding 30 ETH to our on-chain ask in order to account for ETH/DAI volatility. ETH will be converted to match the estimated DAI distribution shared - surplus ETH will be returned to the DAO.\n\n### Dota Pod\n\nWe will be using the same multi-sig that was created via Proposal 68 consisting of Nouners and Nounsfolk. We will be swapping in Nouners Brian Cho and Oni to replace Wag and Goldy.\n- Sasquatch\n- Brennen\n- Maty\n- Brian Cho\n- Oni\n\n### Deliverables\n- Competitive Results\n    - From the Pilot (#68 proposal)...\n        - They won the [BTS Pro Series Season 11: Americas](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/BTS/Pro_Series/11/Americas) \n        - They are currently 6-1 and tied for first place in the DPC North America rankings. While not yet guaranteed, they have positioned themselves to have an excellent shot at attending the upcoming Major in Arlington, Texas.\n    - During this signing, past potentially competing in the Major they will have an opportunity to compete in the ESL Malaysia qualifiers, and qualifiers for The International. \n- Tournament Stream Viewership\n    - Tournament matches during the pilot have regularly received between 10,000 and 40,000 viewers. If the team qualifies for any of the upcoming international events, viewership will be a few multiples higher.\n        - The International 2021 had [2,700,000 peak viewers](https://escharts.com/events/international), excluding China.\n- Individual Stream Viewership\n    - Players individually stream and regularly present the Nouns brand on stream\n        - Our player Gunnar has been the most active streamer regularly getting a [few thousand viewers.](https://twitchtracker.com/gunnardota2)\n- In-game Branding\n    - Dota allows for DPC teams to have in-game branding through assets placed inside of the game's landscape. We have used this to show off Noggles during all of the tournament games in front of tens of thousands of viewers.\n- Name Branding\n    - The team will continue to operate as Nouns/Nouns Esports.\n- Player Name Branding\n    - Player names will include a Nounish sponsor tag in-game e.g. nouns.PlayerName.⌐◨-◨"},{"blockNumber":15148088,"blockHash":"0x97b376876635ccc3589a23a4facb29ec992dd8473fbad19c40058ea3f7d45be1","transactionIndex":312,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x28a7a007596298e69e1dc32a45dfd91b935cb352e644d8b61d08330e180bc0e3","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":113,"proposer":"0xA68FdB0c7ECdC404637C5C06BAB82A7bf00609f3","targets":["0x93629A45bB87C4518cB98Dbd97e016136e89Ce71"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15161228,"endBlock":15180938,"description":"# Nouns Explainer with Ordinary Folk\n\n[![Ordinary Folk Reel](https://i.imgur.com/cU5yEBN.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lgiJcsnIdCy5m_k2fxqMwlmZpN7A5qyQ/view?usp=sharing)\n# Hi, Nouners **⌐◨-◨**.\n\nWe’re [Ordinary Folk](http://www.ordinaryfolk.co). Allow us to introduce ourselves…\n\n[![Ordinary Folk Reel](https://i.imgur.com/LV2e5A7.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M7osmhGv5v4HIvtN321pnJa1EXrdTY4J/view?)\n\n💻 You can see more of our work [here](http://www.ordinaryfolk.co/work).\n \n\nWe’re a big fan of NFTs and explaining complex ideas — simply and beautifully. We’ve been doing it for a while with companies you may have heard of, and we’d like to do it for you.\n\n# Proposal\n\nWe propose commissioning Ordinary Folk to create a 1-2 minute fully animated video. Explaining Nouns, how they work and why the community is so valuable.\n\n# But, why?\n\nWe know Nouns are awesome, but scrolling through all this? \n\nNot so awesome.\n\n![webNavGIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/YwFuI4outa3r6PYdlj/giphy.gif)\n\nA much better way to go through this information is with an animated explainer. Sure, we're biased, but the facts remain that explainers have the power to communicate complex and vast amounts of information in a short and entertaining way.\n\nWe think a project of this caliber deserves nothing but the best, and a clear explainer that explains the function and reason behind Nouns will really bring Nouns to more eyes, normies, and degens alike.\n\n# Summary\n\nOrdinary Folk would leverage our production expertise to manage, creative direct, storyboard, design, animate, and facilitate the composition of an original score, and voice-over recording for a Nouns animated explainer. The full production package.\n\n## Creative Commons\n\nAll of our deliverables will be CC0 with open source files.\n\n![webNavGIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/USgwvuKFBz60A7S5hY/giphy.gif)\n\n# Ordinary Folk’s Process\n\nWe trust the process, and ours is highly iterative and linear. Feedback will be managed differently than in other projects given the nature of the DAO, more specifically:\n\nWhen the project is executed, Ordinary Folk will build out a milestone schedule to send the DAO regular updates requesting specific feedback and guidance on the tone, voice, direction of the animation. \n\nAll Nouners and community will have the opportunity to comment for each work-in-progress in discord for 24 hours. How and if we apply the feedback will be up to our discretion and expertise.\n\nThat said, given the nature of the script writing process, we would ask that we can have at least 1 Nounder that we can have 2 or 3 script conversations with to make sure the messaging is exactly what it needs to be.\n\nStarting with the first concept review, Nouners and community are directly involved in developing the product in a tangible way and Ordinary Folk will guide and decide on how to execute the project for the best product.\n\n💡 From award to delivery, the process generally takes ~8 - 10 weeks\n\n\n\nHere’s an overview…\n\n---\n## Step 1: Scripting\n\nAnimation is a visual and audio storytelling medium but you always start with a good foundation — the script. Messaging in animation is a balance of showing and telling. We'll first focus on having the script stand on its own while building a plan for the visuals and sound.\n\n💡 Scripting generally takes ~1 - 2 weeks\n\n## Storyboarding, Design, & Animation\n\nWhile we work on locking down the script and recording the voice-over, we’ll also be working on creative direction, storyboards, design, sound, and animation. \n\nHere are a few examples of each step:\n\n## Step 2: Storyboarding\n\n![storyboard01](https://i.imgur.com/QQJnRUu.png)\n\n![storyboard02](https://i.imgur.com/ijYffAY.png)\n\n\n### Storyboarding Animatic\n\n[![Storyboard Animatic SOM](https://i.imgur.com/RJtPPY6.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KG9_dUej6qcWyWNZIO4cxG3nAh-Lt0g7/view?usp=sharing)\n*Storyboard Animatic for School of Motion.*\n\n## Step 3: Design / Styleframes\n\n![styleframe01](https://i.imgur.com/C1Yaf5o.jpg)\n![styleframe02](https://i.imgur.com/J3fwudv.jpg)\n![styleframe03](https://i.imgur.com/9VKwP1E.jpg)\n![styleframe04](https://i.imgur.com/Z6YEiEB.jpg)\n![styleframe05](https://i.imgur.com/4ibNpPg.jpg)\n![styleframe06](https://i.imgur.com/nmN8FNU.png)\n\n## Step 4: Animation\n\nThe process of animation is very intentional, tedious AND the most exciting phase when you begin to see elements from the designs come to life. \n\nWe'll send a series of videos showing our work in progress (WIP). WIPs may also come in the form of motion tests or a series of gifs. When we have enough motion compiled together we'll send videos that are a mix of still a motion to show our progress.\n\n![Rough Pencil Pass](https://media.giphy.com/media/SiEiGfR0MJiaARmtff/giphy.gif)=\n*Rough Pencil Pass.*\n\n![WIP Animation of the same shot](https://media.giphy.com/media/OsfGmba8n7AtXKjF4O/giphy.gif)\n*WIP Animation of the same shot.*\n\n### WIP Examples\n[![Twilio WIP Example](https://i.imgur.com/vhJT3gu.jpg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j2pagFQM_anX-gkFjM-Lq_qOjHM1NlbC/view?usp=sharing)\n*Twilio WIP Example.*\n\n[![School of Motion WIP Example](https://imgur.com/vbvik4M.jpg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h1GNwX7DqwD5vk0YCk2pRgLdsgZmUN6-/view?usp=sharing)\n*School of Motion WIP Example.*\n\n## Step 5: Sound\n\n### Voice Over\n\nWhen the script is locked we'll begin the casting for a VO actor. From there we'll have the actor record the script.\n\n### Score & SFX\n\nThe composer will begin scoring when we have a locked animatic with the final VO timing. We'll constantly be tweaking the score and animation to match and elevate each other.\n\nSound design (the process of adding sound effects) and sound mixing (adjusting the levels of the VO, score, and sound effects.) are the finishing touches of our projects. Adding a final level of polish to our work.\n\n# The final product\n\nHere are a few of our favorite pieces which may inspire our work with Nouns:\n\n[![Minima](https://imgur.com/kYoX9OY.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/691634099)\n*Minima*\n\n[![Webflow](https://imgur.com/EkjA6Vy.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/664409837)\n*Webflow*\n\n[![School of Motion](https://imgur.com/20aDMXs.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/360269073)\n*School of Motion*\n\n\n[![SAP](https://imgur.com/AGzRs5x.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/368584682)\n*SAP*\n\n\n# Technical Specs & Delivery\n\n### Specifications\n\nWe’ve scoped this project with these specs:\n\n- 1x - 1 - 2 minute animation delivered in two renders optimized for web and prores.\n- Designed and mastered in 4K, 16:9, 30fps.\n- AE animation project files for CC0 use.\n\n# Pricing\n\n| Description | Pricing in ETH |\n| --- | --- |\n| Fees: Creative Direction, Design, Animation, AE Project Files for CC use | 115 ETH  |\n| Original Score | 8 ETH |\n| Voice-over | 2 ETH |\n**| GRAND TOTAL: | 125 ETH |**\n\n💡 Noun 347 will receive a finders fee of 7% of the total price\n\n\n---\n\n# Production Schedule\n\nIf executed, we’ll deliver a production schedule of 8-10 weeks with a start date not to exceed September 1.\n\n---\n**Thank You!**\n![image alt](https://media.giphy.com/media/xKVASQrGgLX0rIjxpz/giphy.gif) "},{"blockNumber":15149167,"blockHash":"0xd1c937970e99d1b90fe35e91df3bd47aedcf91bd512d3b70ab51e71497ff1b9e","transactionIndex":284,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x2f70930054a5555d50457affbbe8d571eb66f8e955b7e6692c0a753d65df40b5","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":114,"proposer":"0xAC56E6156C9c0C56b6D9a4E8388799F25d7fEb86","targets":["0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03"],"signatures":["setDescriptor(address)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000006229c811d04501523c6058bfaac29c91bb586268"],"startBlock":15162307,"endBlock":15182017,"description":"# Descriptor V2 Upgrade\n\nThis proposal activates a new version of the Nouns Descriptor contract, which contains many improvements upon the previous version. The Descriptor is the contract that stores and renders Noun artwork and token metadata.\n\n**Descriptor Improvements**:\n\n* Significantly cheaper on-chain art deployment, which largely benefits builders that fork the Nouns protocol. The gas required to deploy the Nouns artwork has been reduced nearly 5x.\n* Improved external API, which boosts composability by allowing external contracts to more easily hook into the Noun artwork and rendering engine.\n* Improved descriptor upgradability. The new descriptor separates the artwork, renderer, and facilitator contracts, which enable much cheaper upgrades (e.g. trait retirement).\n\n**Note**: This proposal is separate from the 8/8 art additions, which will be proposed separately in the coming weeks.\n\n* [Specification](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-tech/blob/main/descriptor-v2/README.md)\n* [Pull Request](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/499)\n\nThis code has been reviewed by multiple technical community members, has unit/integration test coverage, and has been tested on both Rinkeby and Mainnet.\n\nIn addition, we’ve retroactively fixed seven art errors and oversights. These fixes will not only apply to art moving forward, but will reach back in time to correct Nouns that contain the offending traits. All fixes are either recoloring of existing pixels or removing of extra pixels. Most errors are likely a result of iteration and palette color reduction prior to the launch of Nouns - some that melded two colors into one, or put two formerly-different colors closer to one another. No pixels are being added in this update. Emoji voting in discord indicated support for this effort.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SSAquuV.png)\n\n**Piggybank**: Removal of cluster of erroneous pixels around the tail region.\n\nReason for error: Oversight.\n\n**Beer**: There are several pixels that are only slightly off in color. They've been filled in with the correct color so it's all one full-bodied beer.\n\nReason for error: Weirdness created by palette color reduction.\n\n**Multicolored glasses**: There are inconsistent rules applied to this trio of frames, resulting in a distracting appearance from one to the next. Additionally, this fix helps retain the frame shape unless they're going to blend into the head, which is an anomaly.\n\nReason for error: Oversight.\n\n**Watermelon frames**: These were the same color as the Guava frames.

FWB is looking for support from Nouns DAO to publicly amplify these conversations to the wider Web3 community and beyond, under CC0 and a content distribution partnership. \n\nAdditionally, we’d like to use this as an opportunity to craft a culturally oriented session around Nouns DAO at the conference, while bridging our communities together through this DAO-to-DAO collaboration. \n\n**Who We Are**\nFriends with Benefits is a worldwide group of creators, thinkers, and builders who sit at the intersection of Web3 and culture. As one of the earliest social token communities, FWB’s members span a diverse range from the heavily crypto native to the more recently, and eagerly, onboarded. \n\n**Introducing FWB FEST**\nBetween August 12-14, 2022, FWB will be hosting the inaugural [FWB FEST](https://fest.fwb.help) in Idyllwild, California to bring together our global community to discuss how Web3 will continue to shape the future of culture. \n\nThe FWB community aims to grow FWB FEST into a premier conference that annually showcases leading topics and conversations around how Web3 is affecting culture. \n\n*FWB FEST will:*\n* Gather ~500 community members IRL \n* Livestream the event to thousands more digitally \n* Take over the historic 200+ acre campus of the Idyllwild Arts Academy in the San Jacinto Mountains outside of Los Angeles\n* Feature a world class speaking and music lineup including:\n\nPerformances: James Blake, Pussy Riot, Oneohtrix Point Never, L’Rain, Weyes Blood, Mustafa, and more \n\nSpeakers: Hayden Adams (Uniswap), Nadya Tolokonnikova (Pussy Riot, Unicorn DAO), David Rudnick, Meltem DeMirors, Glen Wyl (Radical Exchange, DeSoc), Toby Shorin (Other Internet), Kei Kreutler (Gnosis), Yancey Strickler (Metalabel, Kickstarter) & More\n\nFull lineup [here](https://fest.fwb.help/).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JLnuCD7.jpg) \n\n\n\n\n**How can we partner?**\n\n**FWB FEST Content Co-Brand and Distribution** \nFWB, with support from Nouns, will capture and record the keynote talks from FWB FEST and make these talks publicly accessible to the world under CC0 through concise video formats. All talks would include Nouns DAO logo placement.\n\nKeynote sample conversations at FWB FEST include:\n\n*Cultural Currency*\nNadya Tolokonnikova (PussyRiot, Unicorn DAO), Hayden Adams (Founder, Uniswap), Trevor McFedries (Brud & FWB)\n\n*Future of Identity & Soul Bound Tokens*\nGlen Weyl (Author, Radical Markets), Christopher Kulendran Thomas (Founder, EARTH), Puja Ohlhaver (Researcher)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Hxr1GRg.jpg)\n\n\n**Nouns DAO Keynote Talk at FWB FEST** \nFWB will organize a keynote talk with and about Nouns, giving people a chance to contextualize Nouns in both an IRL and a thought leadership context. This talk would be crafted in collaboration with Nouns holders to ensure proper representation and storytelling, and would be crafted in collaboration with Jacob Horne and other outspoken Nouners.\n\nThe keynote talk will be hosted live at FWB FEST in front of an audience of ~500 guests, and will be recorded, edited, and distributed as one of the highlighted talks at FWB FEST. \n\nThe main objective will be to contribute public content about Nouns DAO that is tasteful, personable, culturally aligned, and encapsulates a different perspective than the current existing Youtube explainer video formats.\n\n\n**Hosting Nouns DAO on NFT Pirate Radio** \nAs part of this strategy we would also invite Nouns representatives to speak on our most popular digital program, NFT Pirate Radio. \n\nNFT Pirate Radio is presented in collaboration with OpenSea on Twitter Spaces and averages 2,000+ live listeners for each episode. Previous guests of Pirate Radio show include: David Choe, Aaron Penne, Mindy Seu, Andrew Benson, Vivian Fu & Noah Kalina (JPEG2000), and Possessed. \n\nAll NFT Pirate Radio sessions are also recorded and will eventually live as evergreen assets to be further amplified. \n\n**FWB Works in Progress**\nLastly, we would commission a writer within the FWB community to meaningfully tell a story about why Nouns DAO represents an interesting model for brand proliferation via a long-form written piece on FWB Works in Progress, our editorial platform. \n\nPast pieces WIP include:\nWhat Co-Ops and DAOs Can Learn From Each Other by Austin Robey which has garnered 300,000+ impressions. \n\nIn addition to the media strategy above, FWB would integrate Nouns DAO in a few other ways.\n\n**Recognition as official partner of FWB FEST** \nAs an official partner, Nouns branding would be included on the FWB FEST website as well as the FWB newsletter, social media accounts, FEST promotional assets, and on-site guide. \n\n\n**Nouns DAO Ticket Raffle for Nouns Community** \nNouns DAO to receive 10 FWB.FEST NFT tickets to raffle off and give away to Noun community members. \n\n**Why?** \nWe believe this is a meaningful initiative for the Nouns community because it will:\n\n* Democratize and distribute the keynote talks and conversations at FWB FEST for the entire Web3 community to consume, irrespective of location and travel ability.\n* Contribute effective storytelling and thought leadership about Nouns DAO with a cultural perspective and lens \n* Leverage FWB FEST with its high concentration of web3 native and culturally aligned community members. \n* Utilize additional FWB distribution channels like Pirate Radio and FWB Works in Progress to further amplify Nouns storytelling from a cultural perspective \n* Create an initial playbook that Nouns can use to further collaborate with other DAOs\n* Support FWB in its endeavor to create a premier conference and festival experience bridging Web3 and Culture\n\n\n**Funds Requested** \n30 ETH | Video Production Team: Equipment, Labor, Time, Housing, Travel, and Editing\n30 ETH  Stage Production, Lighting, Sound, Venue, and Hard Costs\n10 ETH | FWB FEST Tickets for NounsDAO\n5 ETH | FWB Editorial Commission\n5 ETH | FWB Pirate Radio Nouns Talk Production\n\nTotal: 80 ETH\n\nAll deliverables will be executed between FWB FEST (August 12-14) and September 30th, accounting for proper editing, marketing, and distribution time. \n\n**Who Is Behind This Proposal?**\n\nMembers of the FWB Community & Team Including:\nGabe Quintela, Partnerships\nLindsay Howard, Curatorial & Brand\nAlex Zhang, Mayor\nPaul Tao, Events, Operations\nZach Tetreault, Programming \n& More\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QE0WmMP.jpg)\n\n\n*Relevant Links*\n[FWB FEST Website](https://fest.fwb.help) \n[NYT Feature on FWB](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/technology/friends-with-benefits-crypto-dao.html)\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/FWBtweets) \n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fwbcollection/?hl=en) \n"},{"blockNumber":15183698,"blockHash":"0x78ebc4c73fd1ab4d140f1b43780f969a117330bde00d75305214af41b55cbe9d","transactionIndex":206,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xa1c98928ba1f3d68dc76b9aa876edf893b50a8931b4f3ecf15bde1eb75b998d3","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":116,"proposer":"0xBd7Dbab9AEb52D6c8d0E80fCeBdE3af4CC86204A","targets":["0x4B4a63E170aAC970f45522fB6669a6f268CD672F"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15196838,"endBlock":15216548,"description":"#  Monthly Nouns Comics for mass market release \n\n![Nouns Comic](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/4/4c07d23a7af2e10e5a36289f75f28e869e9c743a.jpeg)\n\nTl;dr\nA monthly cc0 Nouns comic for Nationwide Distribution.\n\nAn initial 6-issue series would be commissioned for a total of $210,000 USD, paid for by selling 7,000 copies of each issue with an exclusive cover to NounsDAO, to be distributed (or sold) as seen fit. The money will be used to pay for all the creatives as well as ensure the work is owned by NounsDAO (both writing and artwork).\n\nThe team, led by DefaultedUser, a 25-year veteran of comics publishing, will create a comic meant to be released not only to the Web3 community but to comic book stores via Titan Comics and to book stores via Penguin Random House.\n\nThe Community will be allowed to vote on aspects of the publishing project starting in July 2022, with the first issue to release to the community in November 2022, and the mass market in March 2023.\n\nAfter issue #6, profits will be used to publish future issues, still with community involvement, as well as fund other Nouns related publishing projects.\n\nIntroduction\nComics have been an art form for over 100 years now, in many ways overtaking novels as the most important written form of creativity for society, and defining Intellectual Property more than Film or Television. Comics have the advantage of a monthly (in some cases) publishing cycle, are able to pump out more content than other mediums, and so are able to connect with a dedicated audience more frequently, as well as generating more stories than other mediums.\n\nComic Books have brought us Spider-man, Superman, Batman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Uncle Scrooge, Garfield, The Far Side, and quite literally tens of thousands more. Nouns is a visual creation, with much room for growth. The dedicated fanbase mimics that of core comic book publications of the past, giving the space and time to grow and be recognized by the worldwide community as a whole.\n\nI have worked in the comic book industry for 25 years now, acting in various roles, but most notably as a publisher for various companies (Including Boom! Studios), as well as creating comics for properties such as Divinity: Original Sin 2, Transformers, Farscape, Warhammer, Warhammer 40K, Mickey Mouse, Frozen, Pixar, Pirates of the Caribbean, Spider-man, Thor, Star Wars, and many others.\n\nIn licensing, one is required to work within certain parameters, while creating a compelling product. This will serve me well when creating Nouns product, being able to listen to the community and create something appealing for the community, while also something that can be successful outside of it.\n\nI have extensive knowledge of how to create compelling content and have a publishing and distribution agreement with Titan books (and through them Penguin Random House), so can focus on making this product physical in nature, and not just a digital offering, as well as something that will see Nouns splashed all over thousands of stores.\n\nUtilize comics to generate constant content, keep the community engaged.\nDevelop stories, worlds, and characters that give more sandboxes for the community and other creatives within the community to play with.\nBring Nouns to the “Mass Market” (Comic book stores, book stores, big box stores, book clubs, libraries). Gives legitimacy to the IP, and expands the potential community.\nCommunity Driven Support\n\nNouns is famously known for its treasury, often used to create interesting projects that further the Nouns ecosystem. What we are proposing is to engage and encourage the community to support the project, creating a financial model that isn’t solely dependent upon a treasury, and using that to expand the area and influence of NounsComics.\n\nMuch like Kickstarter, IndieGogo and Substack have used a model that allows early supporters to get exclusive items, while also funding projects that they have an interest in, and so too will NounsComics. The first engagement is to the Web3 community, as well as the Nouns community, offering access to exclusive comics, covers, and finally the ability to vote as a community on artists and authors, story beats, and covers.\n\nThe initial project will be a six issue comic book, along with a graphic novel release. NounsComics will pre-sell this series, in individual segments. The initial offerings will be:\n\nIndividual issues for sale, as well as the graphic novel (as a package)\nA minimum order of 7,000 copies for sale, which will give an individual or community the chance to commission a special cover of the comic book, which will then be only available to them, to be distributed as they see fit (sold, given away, stored, etc.)\nSales of graded copies of the individual comics, to be graded and placed on the blockchain for them via an NFT once the book has been printed. The specific grade is out of 10, with 10 being absolutely perfect in every way (and is almost impossible to attain), so the grades will be at LEAST 9.6, with the final grade being between 9.6 – 10, randomized.\n\nIndividual comics are priced at $5.00 USD dynamic value\nThe Graphic novel is offered at $30.00 USD dynamic value\nThe graded comics will be offered for $250.00 USD dynamic value\nEvery purchase not only helps fund the project, but will also give the purchaser the right to vote on certain aspects of the comic book series. The individual things that can be voted on are :\n\nThe story concept and writer of the project. We will offer a minimum of 3 choices at the outset, prior to the project going on pre-sale. Each of these concepts and writers will be vetted, to ensure to plagiarism, as well as the ability to deliver a commercially viable product.\n\nThe art style and artist of the project. A minimum of 3 art styles and artists are made available for a range of options. Each of the artists will be vetted to make certain they are capable of delivering a product that will be entertaining, engaging and finally released on a timely basis! Two different styles for publishing are included below.\n\n![Nouns Comic](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/3/3140a561969c3d990dd63159d9063bdddac92511.jpeg)\n\n![Nouns Comic](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/9/9c232c4b6d6af9aca8bf953c610d39eb525c65f2.jpeg)\n\n![Nouns Comic](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/a/a312ffa11cea1e8c36d9f725b72bdc1b25d85d57_2_1380x664.jpeg)\n\nWhich Nouns will be in the comic series. We will want to make sure that those that pre-purchase the series get to suggest and vote for various Nouns, with the top voted not only appearing in the comic series, but also having the Nouns owner engaged to create the voice and personality of the Noun appearing in the comic series.\nFor every single comics cover there will be at minimum 3 concept sketches provided, with votes choosing which one becomes the final cover. The same process will be used for the graphic novel.\n\nAll funds raised in this manner will be kept in a multi-sig wallet, with funds being released to move the project along, specific amounts for each portion of comic creation and issue.\n\nSo, a specific number will be released for the script to be completed for issue #1. After that is approved, a specific amount will be released for the layout of issue #1. After this, an amount will be released for the pencils to be finished for issue #1. Finally, the remaining sum allotted for issue #1 will be released for Colours and Letters of Issue #1. The same process will be repeated for Issues #2-6. In this manner we can keep progress moving in a timely manner, making sure that there are incentives to create the content quickly, but also doing as good a job as possible.\n\nAs the issues are completed, profits (if there are any) will be split in this manner : Payment of 25% of the profits to the publisher of the series. 25% of the profits to the NounsDAO Treasury itself. 40% will be held by NounsComics to keep the series running, and potentially fund new series down the road, and finally 10% to ComicsDAO, who will be onboarding the writers, artists and community members for votes and sales.\n\nWe use the community to fund and engage with the project\nWe pay back to the community with the success of the project\nThere are various onboarding points to the project that can make the community feel invested, choosing which Nouns appear, the feel and style of the project\nAs this project is printed, it will also be sold into comic book stores (and book stores in the case of the graphic novel). This can allow those not familiar with the Nouns community to see what it is capable of, and gives them a simple yet effective point to become engaged themselves. We have a publishing deal for both markets with major publishers, which is how we will accomplish this, NOT through independent publication.\nProfit and Loss\n\nJust some general calculations for the project :\n\nIf we assume a creative cost for the project of $210,000 USD for the six issue series (broken down as $35,000 USD per issue), we would need roughly 7,500 copies of each book sold to pay for printing and creative.\n\nIf we achieve 10,000 copies sold per issue, along with 200 copies sold of the physically graded comics, the financials would look like this :\n\nRevenues : $675,000 USD\nExpenses: $330,000 USD (this includes creative, printing and grading)\n25% to NounsDAO : $86,250 USD\n25% to Publisher : $86,250 USD\n40% to NounsComics : $138,000 USD\n10% to ComicsDAO : $34,500 USD\nFinancial Breakdown\n\nPer issue Cost:\nPencils : $8,000 USD\nScript : $3,000 USD\nInks : $3,000 USD\nColours : $5,000 USD\nLetters : $1,000 USD\nEditing/Scheduling/Management : $10,000 USD\nBonus for completing book on schedule : $5,000 USD\n\nTotal cost per Issue : $35,000 USD\n\nSchedule:\n\nUpon execution of proposal : $40,000 USD to publisher.\n\nAugust, 2022 : Post images for covers to issue #1, open up comics for sale, provide detailed artwork for voting, as well as detailed story outlines for voting.\n\nSeptember, 2022 : Artist, writers and other voting elements will be finished, and work will begin on issue #1.\n\n$40,000 USD released to publisher.\n\nNovember, 2022 : Issue #1 complete, Issue #2 & #3 written.\n\nSolicitation submitted for sale into comic book stores (for February, 2023 release in stores). Sneak preview available to all who pre-purchased the book.\n\nUpon completion of Issue #1, $40,000 USD released to publisher.\n\nDecember, 2022 : Issue #2 complete, Issue #3 penciled, Issue #4 & #5 written.\n\nUpon completion of Issue #2, $40,000 USD released to publisher.\n\nJanuary, 2023 : Issue #3 complete, Issue #4 penciled, Issue #6 written.\n\nUpon completion of Issue #3, $50,000 USD released to publisher.\n\nFebruary, 2023 : Issue #4 complete, Issue #1 is available for sale in comic book stores across North America and Europe. Pre-ordered books will also be shipped to individuals that placed an order for them. Books that were ordered as graded will be sent off to CGC in order to be graded.\n\nMarch, 2023 : Issue #5 completed. Issue #2 is available for sale in comic book stores across North America and Europe. Same process with pre-ordered books, as well as books ordered as graded. Graded copies of Issue #1 will be shipped to individuals that ordered the book.\n\nApril, 2023 : Issue #6 completed. Issue #3 is available for sale in all relevant places, same with pre-ordered books, etc.\n\nSeptember, 2023 : Graphic novel for the series will be available in book stores throughout North America and Europe.\n\nMulti-Signature Wallet\n\nA wallet with signatures from DefaultedUser, JoshuaFisher and SharkDAO will be used to hold the funds that are released from NounsDAO, as well as sales from all books to individuals and communities. Sales from physical copies and stores will see the money placed in this wallet as well, after the expenses are removed by the Publisher (sales, printing, distribution, etc.)\n\nAll expenses will be itemized and available upon request online, to ensure that the wallet will contain the appropriate amount of money at all times.\n\n25% profits to NounsDAO\n\nThe goal will be to make this a profitable endeavour in order to not just perpetuate published projects for the Nouns community, but to also generate revenues for the Nouns, in return for the initial support, concept generation, and paying back to the community. This will be achieved by placing 25% of the profits in a separate wallet, to be used to purchase Nouns. This will place the money back into the Treasury, and allow us to place additional publishing and content creation proposals ourselves, along with giving us a voice in our ability to vote on initiatives that we are supportive of.\n\nConclusion\nWith this approach, we can engage with the community, incentivize them to participate, and also grow the ecosystem beyond Web3. Until there is an easy onboarding process for the non-Web3 natives, Nouns cannot grow beyond this space. This might seem like an obstacle to overcome, but in fact, it is an asset. Most projects start from zero, with no supportive community to support it, and encourage others to participate.\n\nWe will leave with one story, that illustrates how dangerous no community is, and how it can make or break a project. A comics creator named Jeff Smith published a book series called Bone way back in 1991. At the time, it was one of the few black and white comics, didn’t have the monthly schedule that buyers liked, and was completely different from what was being published at the time. Jeff has commented repeatedly in later years that he nearly canceled the series numerous times within the first 10 issues. It was a very small community that supported his early works and allowed him to keep publishing (55 issues between 1991 and 2004). As the series continued on, it grew in fame and prestige, until in 2005 it was picked up by Scholastic books, and released through their new imprint. At this time it is one of the highest selling graphic novel series of all time, beating out all the superhero releases since the 1940’s to present day.\n\nWithout a supportive community, this project wouldn’t see the light of day, nor be given the space to continue and finally achieve the great success it deserves. The Nouns community can allow the same to happen with NounsComics, giving any project created a chance to grow and incubate until the world has a chance to enjoy it.\n\nSend 175ETH ($210,000.00) ETH equivalent to Gnosis Safe to be converted into USDC.

I will be tapping into WEB3SG presence; one of the largest NFT twitter community in Singapore for this activation/promotion of Nouns Booth @ COMEX Singapore\n\n**FUNDS BREAKDOWN**\n|Description|Cost in USD*|Cost in ETH**|Cost in ETH***|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|COMEX booth (4x Days activation)<br><br> Includes:<br> - Designing of booth, having a feature wall<br> for photo opportunity<br> - Setting up / Tearing down / Dispoal <br> - 1x Information counter<br> - 1x TV screen to display live auction<br> - 2x display of Nouns @ COMEX virtual gallery<br> - 2x display of Nouns @ Artnow gallery<br>- 1x Tweet by WEB3SG to promote Nouns Booth<br>- 1x Twitter space to promote Nouns Booth|12,000|10.00|7.50|\n|Noggle Stickers (5,000pcs)|500|0.42|0.31|\n|Pins (1,000pcs)|1,500|1.25|0.94|\n|Tote Bags (500pcs)|900|0.75|0.56|\n|Brochure (2500pcs)|200|0.17|0.13|\n|Socks (500pcs)|800|0.67|0.50|\n|Shirt (500 pcs)|1,900|1.58|1.19|\n|Operations:<br> - 2x manpower for 4 days|4,000|3.33|2.50|\n|Transportation|300|0.25|0.19|\n|Total|22,100|18.42|13.81|\n<!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\n\n*Base on local vendor price converted to USD\n**Considering an ETH avg. price of 1,200 USD due to possible fluctuations\n***Considering current ETH avg. price of 1,600 USD\n\n**SUMMARY**\nThis will be a great opportunity to create a Nounish IRL experience which is spread across 4 days of activation at one of the largest most anticipated annual event in Singapore; an opportunity to have Nouns branding reach out to a wider audience. \n\nAs COMEX is held on 1-4th Sep, this gives me a timeline of around 1 month. If proposal is able to pass and fund received within this week, majority of the funds will be converted to fiat as outlay for manufacturing Nounish goodies, remaining funds will be transfer to WEB3SG (ETH) as payment for the booth space at COMEX. I have already designed and created the files for the booth, thus I can pass them to WEB3SG who will manufacture and erect the booth. I will focus on overseeing the process as well as focusing on execution and administrative work prior to COMEX. \n\n\n**LONG TERM GOAL**\nI will continue to grow Nouns Singapore community under @nounsinsg, with Nouns Booth as the initiate activation. Nounsinsg will serve as a proliferation pod, guidance and point of contact for new contributor as well as creating more IRL Nounish experience in the future. Similar to Aubtoshi, a personal long-term goal is to officially be a Nouner. Until then, I will continue to proliferate Nouns in ways that are fun and effective that I can make possible. A IRL activation that I've been working on would be \"NOUNISH BEACH CLEAN UP' which was passed and supported by SMALL GRANT. (Thank you @noun22) It is scheduled on 13th Aug 2022, you may find more info and update on the event below. \n\nI want to thank all Nouners in advance for giving me the chance to contribute and proliferate Nouns together! \n\n**Transactions**\nGiven the time sensitivity of this proposal, the transaction embedded will send 15 ETH to the Small Grants multi-sig.  If this proposal seems likely to pass in early voting, Small Grants will release the funds to the proposer a few days in advance of the proposal being queued and executed."},{"blockNumber":15220401,"blockHash":"0x91aa4ca00e921a363e64c1269af77d39c8a090ff83c279e48a7276af32643b1e","transactionIndex":62,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x928dce024b6f040b46a6491817fc3f250e5ea5f6d8f8f3120cfdf0e8150760fa","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":118,"proposer":"0x36A5Bc205DF1ED65C86301022cfc343a6ce546ff","targets":["0xF33EBc4b89a1E5Fa437aAE6eF25a8727094E1606"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15233541,"endBlock":15253251,"description":"# NounsDAO Brazil\n\n# tl;dr\nBuild a community to nounify Brazil ⌐◨-◨\n \n# Description\n \nNounsDAO Brazil seeks to introduce Nouns in the diverse cultural manifestations that provide identity and tell the story of our country. Therefore, we want to connect local artists and builders, aiming to create and proliferate Nouns, and collaborate with established Brazilian brands for merch collabs. It is also crucial to onboard those who might not be able to overcome language barriers by distributing content and organizing events in the native language, Portuguese. With that in mind, we are proposing Nouns Week, an event in four capital cities. Our web content can also reach people living in eight other countries besides Brazil. Over 260 million people (3.7% of the world's population) speak Portuguese, the fourth most used language after Mandarin, English, and Spanish.\n\n# What have we done so far? (track record)\n\n1. A contest on NounsDAO Brazil Twitter to nounify Brazilian symbols and memes, offering a prize to three winners. There were 23 submissions, great engagement and a lot of fun. \n![Winners](https://i.postimg.cc/4yXBpKcv/Cqr-Fl-Dd-Imgur.jpg)\n2. Three proposals approved via Prop House:\n- 100 nounish hoodies for homeless people\n![Hoodies](https://i.postimg.cc/FsdD3QdB/cbn-Dz-Ml-Imgur.jpg)\n- 20 Twitter covers for 20 nouns projects \n![Prop House cover](https://i.postimg.cc/hv98ZKLD/x-Nx-Nuvh-Imgur.jpg)\n- Nouns OS as an entire Operating System Nouns-Themed for All Things Nouns\n![Nouns OS](https://i.postimg.cc/zGdYdgFf/Nouns-OS-Desk-Blue-Sample.png)\n3.

Noun heads contest: start an art contest on NounsDAO Brazil Twitter to create noun heads with Brazilian motives, offering 2 ETH prize split among 3 winners. \n5. Twitter spaces: regular Twitter spaces held in Portuguese to spread awareness, and special spaces in English to give this community access to guests that don't speak Portuguese. \n6. Website: create and launch NounsDAO Brazil website.\n7. Merch collabs: contact well-established Brazilian brands like [Havaianas](https://havaianas.com.br/), [Melissa](https://www.melissa.com.br/), and [Hering](https://www.hering.com.br/) for a collaboration using noggles in the product's design. \n![Havaianas](https://i.postimg.cc/QdCpT26y/havaianas-cidade-840x577.jpg)\n![Melissa](https://i.postimg.cc/2543bTft/Melissa-x-Karl-Lagerfeld.jpg)\n![Hering](https://i.postimg.cc/bNWvm4yM/hering.jpg)\n\n# Nouns Week Brazil\n\nWe are planning a Nouns week in October 2022 with simultaneous nounification of four capital cities from north to south of Brazil.

Fuel the growth of a sub-community within the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n### **Description**\n\nContinuing the work of Prop #68, #91, and #112, this Esports Pod (comprised of esports-native Nouners and Nounsfolk) will function in a manner similar to the thriving small grants initiative within Nouns. It will use a delegated treasury to look for outsized opportunities within esports to continue proliferating Nouns with the best ROI possible. \n\n#### **Didn't we just pass an esports proposal?**\n- All of our esports proposals so far have been game-specific.\n- We have a very deep talent pool of esports native Nouners and Nounsfolk who can capably proliferate across a variety of titles.\n- Having quick access to funds will allow for better proliferation, as the competitive landscape has an ever-evolving calendar that makes the formal proposal process slow. \n- The pod has already been pitched multiple proposal ideas from high-level esports operators.\n    - Sending international players to the largest fighting game event.\n    - Sponsoring a high-level Dota LAN.\n    - Signing a League of Legends team.\n\n### **Esports Pod**\n- Consisting of Nouners and Nounsfok who are familiar with esports and aligned towards the mission of proliferation across the DAO. \n    - **Sasquatch** (Nouncil, Esports background)\n    - **Brennen** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **Maty** (Nouncil)\n    - **Oni** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **Brian Cho** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **Jason Oliver** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **Deeze** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **thebeautyandthepunk** (Nouner) \n    - **Brax** (Esports background)\n    - **PPD** (Esports background)\n    - **Griff** (Esports background)\n\n#### **Pod Structure** \n- The structure of the pod will be flexible, this means members can be added/removed based on a supermajority vote.\n- Upon initial deployment, the pod will functionally operate inside of the Nouns Esports Discord server.\n- Members of the Pod will vote over each proposed use of funds.\n    - Any member can sponsor a proposal.\n- A multi-sig consisting of Sasquatch, Brennen, Maty, Brian Cho, and Oni will operate funds.\n- All use of funds will be documented in a manner transparent to the Nouns community.\n\n### **Budget: 369 ETH**\n- This budget will be governed by the members of the Esports Pod and controlled by a 3/5 multi-sig. \n    - Address: [0x8b45D1CACcb3593E9F1015BA8e97AFB68DE3a0d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b45D1CACcb3593E9F1015BA8e97AFB68DE3a0d1)\n- For operational purposes, we will keep a portion of the standing budget as the stablecoin DAI.\n- Distribution:\n    - Proposals (~90%)\n    - Operations (max 10%) -  We've already had a broad range of contributions, any compensation related to those efforts (outside of individual proposals) will have to be voted on internally and awarded retroactively.\n        - Running weekly meetings, onboarding esports operators into Nouns, Discord & Twitter management, building the prop, multiple people taking calls and evaluating pitches, etc. \n        - May explore using Coordinape.\n#### **Potential Use of Funds**\n- Flexible funding towards infrastructure costs for each team we sign to Nouns Esports.\n    - Bootcamps, logistics, special events. \n- Sponsoring additional players, streamers, or teams.\n    - Each game is its own vertical to build within.\n- Funding Projects:\n    - Nouns Network\n        - We see the talent network at Nouns to be one of the best features to leverage as we grow.  These projects may already be independently funded, we would have standing budget available to work with them in an esports capacity.\n            - Examples:\n                - Nouns Esports x [Nounish](https://twitter.com/nounish) (Prop 64) - Filming our players at events, advising on marketing strategy.\n                - Nouns Esports x [Nouns Brand](https://twitter.com/nounsbrand) (Prop 109) - Designed outfits for the players at events, merch for fans.\n                - Nouns Esports x [NOUNS ON THE GROUND](https://twitter.com/nounsotg) (Prop 110) - Sending the Proliferation Pod to events our teams compete in.\n                - Supporting an Esports [Prop House](https://twitter.com/nounsprophouse).\n    - Event Sponsorships\n        - Outsized opportunities to have high brand exposure through streaming or physical events.\n    - Streamers, Pros, or Casters with AR or Physical Noggles.\n    - Creating gamer Noggles with blue light filter.\n    - Creating team jerseys for players and fans.\n- Forking Nouns to create an esports-specific subDAO\n    - Designs created to represent games we participate in.\n### **Future**\n- Sustainability\n    - We believe Nouns Esports inherently works to proliferate the Nouns brand, but we are still interested in exploring a path towards creating a self-sustaining sub-community. \n    - Pillars this could be built on:\n        - Forking Nouns\n            - Exploring a subDAO mechanic which allows for fans to engage with the team at a greater level than existing esports organizations.\n        - Sponsors\n            - Traditional web2 sponsors.\n            - Web3 sponsors that the DAO chooses to affiliate with.\n        - Nouns Esports in-game items\n\n### **Testimonials**\n\n> e-sports has been one of the highest ROI proposals (in terms of attention generated) thus far...the success of nouns e-sports clearly demonstrates the power of handing the reigns to the community\n -[Nounder 4156](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1544800982399438849)\n\n>  I was a bit skeptical at first I'll admit but it was our Dota team that got my brother (a perennial crypto skeptic) to go from \"all NFTs are a scam\" to \"all NFTs except for Nouns are a scam\" ... which to me felt big\n -[Nouncillor brianj](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/943943469821476944/996129684200894526)\n \n > One of the reasons why I bought a noun was because I saw the positive impact that the nounsesports was creating to the greater gaming community...watching the dota 2 esports community (hardcore pc gamers) embrace the nouns ⌐◨-◨ meme has been incredible\n-[Nouner Brian Cho](https://twitter.com/brianjcho/status/1543411851907645440)\n\n> Nounsesports was how I first learned about nouns and was really impressed with how the group was able to resonate with a hardcore gaming audience such as pro Dota 2 fans. Given my background helping to build esports at Riot and then as a board director at Astralis, I’m a big believer that esports helps gamers turn their love for games into part of their broader identity.

An initiative that is comprehensive in nature, flexible in delivery, and aligned with specific wellbeing objectives that are drawn from global social and emotional wellness research. Combining our depth of experience in app development, education and content creation to deliver a remarkable outcome.\n\nWe have already created over 100 apps and wellness programs to great success, this will be our best of the best - an innovative, Noun branded mobile app for iOS and Android that will be an important support for kids when they need it most.\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#what-are-you-proposing-3)What Are You Proposing?\n\nNOUNS Wellness (name to be confirmed) is a mobile mental health app for the next generation. Using play and community spirit, kids are inspired and engaged with games and activities to actually practice mental health daily.\n\nThis proposal will cover details on how we can do this and why we are the team who can make this happen.\n\nAnd also how this initiative is more than a good idea…\n\nIt’s potentially the very essence that makes NOUNS nounish. And what we see is a perfect match to the mission to not only proliferate the NOUNS brand, but also the NOUNS’ mission of goodwill.\n\nLET’S GO!\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#why-are-you-doing-it-4)Why Are You Doing It?\n\nMental health has never been more important post pandemic…\n\n-   …And this time it’s the kids who are feeling the pressure, not just stressed out adults or Web3 degens. There are global stats that show some very alarming numbers with teen depression, anxiety and sadly suicides. There’s a lot to find wrong with the world, so activaley reminding, educating and inspiring young people has become integral to their wellbeing and their future.\n    \n-   Nouns Wellness will also have a natural ripple effect through our Web3 community. As part of the crypto culture, mental health is on everyone’s lips in Twitter Spaces and in Discord, but there has yet to be the wellness project to emerge and really connect with and serve the wider Web3 community.\n    \n-   Nouns is a project close to our hearts and we are aligned with what it represents. It excites us to see the diverse range of future collaborations and partnerships where we can proliferate the brand and its mission.\n    \n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#why-nouns-5)Why Nouns?\n\nSomething that makes habits stick and fitness routines engaging is play and fun.\n\n-   As pioneers in transforming fitness education with play at its center, we saw immediately how a playful and fun brand like Nouns can boost the wellness conversation with young people.\n-   And at the same time boost the Nouns brand and positioning further, by activating real world engagement with Nouns and the super healthy benefits of a wellness practice.\n\nIn a word… Nouns will make wellness FUN. And Nouns are what wellness will look like for young kids. No-one is owning this wellness space for kids the way Nouns can.\n\n(Plus as a Web3 native brand Nouns open the door to the conversation with young people about NFTs and what the blockchain means to our future.)\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#how-is-this-different-to-whats-already-out-there-6)How Is This Different to What’s Already out There?\n\nThe go-to apps out there: Headspace, Calm and similar, are designed for adults.\n\nThey also only offer one type of mindfulness, (including ones for children) - guided experiences that are consumed in one direction. In our decades of experience with kids (and adults too) we have proven that interactive activities and playful tasks are game changers. Like moving your body with active play instead of reps on a gym mat.\n\nThis interactive approach is a major point of difference in the overall physical and mental wellbeing space. There are so many ways of doing wellbeing, but they’re not fun… Until NOUNS Wellness.\n\nAdditionally: The app source code we create will be open source and available for use by the Noun community.\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#who-is-the-audience-how-are-you-going-to-market-this-app-7)Who Is the Audience? How Are You Going to Market This App?\n\nAs established business owners and leaders in the fitness, education and wellness space, we have an active database of 45,000+ teachers, schools, fitness professionals and educators who are actively trusting and consuming everything we create. A recommendation from us to this audience will activate thousands of teachers and schools as users.\n\nAmong these people we also have strong and reliable partnerships to further amplify reach and engagement beyond the Web3 universe. Offering free, engaging and ‘cool’ resources for kids’ wellbeing is something these communities are hungry for.\n\nAdditionally our wellness podcast features interviews with olympians, human potential leaders, international sports personalities and even actors: Energetic Radio by Dale Sidebottom with 260 episodes, weekly releases and thousands of monthly listeners. We are also both regular speakers and have been on stages in 40+ countries. We will promote the app to our engaged social media channels and activate webinar style campaigns, so NOUNS can leverage our existing network and following.\n\nIn short it’s not our first rodeo, we are not a startup like many projects in the Web3 space. We are seeing a synergy between our experience, our existing client base and the Noun brand to elevate both for greater impact – creating the foundations of the future world that Web3 stands for and ideas this project believes in.\n\nWe also aim to place Nouns at the forefront of supporting the Web3 community who are battling with extreme emotions of the daily game of NFT’s and Crypto.\n\nBeyond this scope we believe Nouns could have wider appeal to the global issue of declining health and wellness.

An Animated Pilot* is a 2D tradigital animated 11-minute episode as seen in the [Prop 70 (CC0 Pitchbook)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/70). The show is an animated comedy following the surreal adventures of best friends balancing the desire for mature adulthood and their reluctance to grow up.\n\n# **We propose doing a pilot in 3 phases.**\n**1) Script and Casting (weeks 1-6)** **$150K** \n*-1st milestone Deliver Script Tk01 Draft (End of Week 3)*\n**2) Animatic (weeks 4-11) $200K** \n*-2nd milestone Deliver Storyboards (End of Week 9)*\n**3) Final Animation (weeks 10-16) $150K** \n\nWe are targeting the schedule for ~16 weeks. However, we may need some flexiblity and increase the time it takes to deliver the pilot to ensure we can put out the best product possible.\nIf we start at the beginning of August, we can deliver before the year end.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mKXuW47.jpg)\n\n## **Phase 1: Scripting and Casting** \nThis phase would last for four-six weeks.\nDuring this phase we would work on the outline, script, script revisions and cast the episode.\nStart Date: **08/01/22** \n\n## **Phase 2: Preproduction**\nStarting week 4, we would begin Phase 2.\nThis phase would last seven weeks.\nDuring this phase, we will thumbnail, and storyboard, refine character designs, and backgrounds, create digital puppets and record scratch tracks and audio.\nStart Date: **08/22/22**\n\n## **Phase 3: Production/ Post**\nStarting week 10, we would begin Phase 3.\nThis phase is where the actual animation begins, with compositing, editing, and putting the final touches on everything.\nStart Date: **10/03/22**\n\n# **TOTAL ASK:**\n**~Ξ320 or ($500K USD)** to fund the creation of Nouns!

Artists' short-term freelance rates are higher than longer-term employment rates. There are also discounts on software subscriptions for longer-term commitments.\n\n# **WHY IS THIS UNIQUE?**\nIn developing *Nouns! An Animated Series*, the mission of *Person Place Thing Studios* is to share, inspire, and empower people around the globe through CC0 storytelling.\n\nAs paid professionals in the animation space, we aim to modernize the animation studio and pipeline by no longer requiring industry talent to be tethered to an antiquated studio system, a specific geographic location, or a traditional network distribution model.\n\nWe plan to hire best-in-class artists and designers, make broadcast-quality Nounish content at an accelerated pace, and proliferate Nouns to a worldwide audience via the internet.\n\n# **WHAT IS THE TONE OF THE SHOW?**\n*Nouns! An Animated Series* draws from similar humor and animation quality as *The Regular Show* and *Adventure Time*.  We want to create shows that make us laugh!  Our cast of characters are goofballs!  They escalate simple situations into ridiculous adventures that are filled with unpredictable twists and turns. They rarely solve their problems but always end with a laugh!\n\n# **WHY SHOULD WE BACK THIS?**\n- Bringing Nouns to life through animation is the next leap in introducing these characters to the mainstream culture of all ages.\n- Distributing on Youtube, Twitter, Tiktok, etc, allows Nouns to reach an enormous audience.\n- Casting top talent as the voices of our characters will bring known celebrities to the world of Nouns and generate larger social media awareness and traditional media buzz.\n- Developing episodes in the 11-minute format also opens the door to legacy media distribution.\n\n# **BENEFITS TO THE DAO**\n- We love the Nouns characters and are dying to see them come to life!\n- Pilot episode will be CC0!\n- Cartoons are a great source of memeonic content; our show will create many shareable clips that can help with the mission of proliferation.\n- Cartoons are also a great invitation to a much wider and younger audience. \n- There will be new nounish content made and shared every day!\n- Having an animated show will add value to other extensions in the Nouns ecosystem.\n- Through Discord, the DAO will be an active participant in the creative process.\n- Any profits obtained will be reinvested in the studio to make additional Nouns animated content.\n- *Person Place Thing Studios* can be utilized in the creation of content for future DAO Proposals (episodic cartoons, commercial endeavors, music videos, shorts, etc)(i.e. The Greidiens pitch gets sold to a network, rather than having to shop around looking for a studio to work with we would already be set up to handle their needs.)\n- As educators, we will be inviting and sending the CC0 assets to schools for their students to use as they learn animation while creating nounish content.\n\n# **WHO ARE THE CREATIVES?**\n\n**Sam Ellis:**\nSam Ellis (Person) makes comics, cartoons, and games (Things) although he has also helped create a few people as well. He has worked for a myriad of comic publishers, animation, and game studios in a variety of positions from LA to Atlanta (Places). Some of his past projects have been: *Archer, Adventure Time, Bravest Warriors, The Awesomes, Frisky Dingo, Catbug*, and more.\n\n**Jason Shwartz:**\nJason Shwartz is an Emmy-nominated Director with extensive experience in broadcast television production and direction. He has directed broadcast shows for *Netflix, [adultswim], Comedy Central, Hulu, 20th Century Fox, SyFy, AppleTV, IFC, FX, and Disney*.

For example, a community could vote on who to receive funds or what NFT to buy or even mint, and depending on the result of the vote, the transaction would be executed.\n\nMore excitingly, it also enables composable governance that could combine different transactions. For example, a community could vote on different features for an NFT, and the top three options could be combined to mint a unique image reflecting the different votes.\n\nExtensible contracts would enable a whole new generation of projects in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nSome examples, please: how will this proliferate Nouns?\n\nWe imagine Nouns forks in the future won’t simply replicate Nouns but develop unique minting and auction mechanisms of their own to innovate on the Nouns playbook—not simply its art, but its model.\n\nHere are a few examples of Nouns forks that jokedao could enable through extensible contracts:\n\nCreate-a-Noun. Communities could submit and vote on the different properties of a Nouns that could then be automatically generated to incorporate each of the individual qualities.\n\nUser-generated Nouns. Enable NFT-derived voting power so that communities could create interactive Nouns projects in which the holders of NFTs could collectively submit and vote on the design of each subsequent NFT.\n\nNouns governance giveaways. Every 10th Noun (derivative) could be given away to a member of the community who had voted on the most winning options in the previous 9 contests, in order to incentivize voting and reward those who build social consensus with a community to vote on winning options.\n\nNouns governance rewards. Rewards (NFTs, Poaps, tokens, portions of the treasury, etc.) could be given away to those who have voted consistently in Nouns proposals in order to incentivize active participation.\n\nOn-chain Nouns Grants. jokedao could collaborate with Prop House to enable fully on-chain and open-source grants for communities to use to incentivize builders to develop their NFT universe.\n\n## Context\n\njokedao started as a Nouns fork through its proof-of-concept, the jokerace—a weekly contest in which the community of $JOKE holders votes on the 2nd best joke of the week, which is minted as an NFT that’s sold on a recurring basis. It is likely the first case in which an NFT collection was fully community-created. Since launching in the spring, the jokerace has regularly drawn around 100 weekly players who return each week, consistently sold NFTs, and incentivized the creation of teams that compete. In other words, as a DAO, it’s organically incentivized the creation of subDAOs without input or management from the core team.\n\nSince then, jokedao has built a platform with scaffold eth for creating and running contests by minting voting tokens and sharing them with communities. Currently 8 EVM-compatible chains are supported so communities can deploy contests and voting tokens on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, etc. We are relaunching with clean, beautiful UI in a few weeks.\n\nProjects like MetricsDAO and Backdrop already use jokedao for contests with their community, and jokedao has soft commits from about another dozen projects in the space to use it for governance after the site relaunch—many of these are NFT projects looking to give their communities more ways to collectively create NFTs themselves. Other popular use cases include grants, giveaways, and content creators letting their communities tell them what kind of content to create.\n\nFinally, let’s emphasize that neither bottom-up nor on-chain governance have been unlocked in NFTs or DAOs to date. Projects typically give few avenues for their communities to express their ideas or cocreate beyond approving proposals of a core team. And on-chain governance has been prohibitive due to gas fees until the past few months.\n\nBoth of these unlock exciting opportunities for DAOs and NFT projects to create far more inclusive and incentivized communities—as we’ve seen with both Nouns and the jokerace.\n\n## Why?\n\nNouns is unique among NFT projects for a number of reasons—but perhaps most of all that it’s the only NFT project with the means and model to incentivize builders to develop its ecosystem’s value through forks, homages, expansion packs, and next-generation projects. No other NFT project has this.\n\nJokedao’s thesis is that the next wave of NFTs and DAOs will be far more interactive and community-governed than this last wave—which has primarily seen centralized figures appealing to consumers to support them, rather than to actively cocreate. Nouns has shown the strongest evidence of this trend, and it seems clear that the next generation of NFT DAOs will go further in letting their communities compete, team up, and create as fun forms of gamified governance. Nouns is in the best position to support these projects within its own ecosystem to grow its value, and jokedao would love to team up to make it happen.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nExtensible contract module: enabling contests to automatically execute transactions depending on the result of a vote\nCreator submission control: enabling only contest creators to submit options for a community to choose from (avoiding user-generated code that may have issues)\nComposable contracts: enabling different winning votes to be combined, for example to combine different properties of a Nouns into a new NFT\nCore Team\n\nDavid Phelps is a 2x SaaS founder who cofounded ecodao, created a web3 angels collective (cowfund), advises TCG Crypto, is a Gitcoin Steward, and writes on web3 on his substack and twitter 1. He was named one of the top 20 leaders in the DAO space by Seed Club.\n\nSean McCaffery is a Software and Data Engineer with a background in building systems for finance and data analytics firms, is building DAOs including Juicebox and the towers three, and has been the engineer of jokedao’s entire current site. Here is their GitHub 1 and Twitter.\n\nNaomi Hauret has been a front-end developer for the past 6 years.

His face appears on posters all over Paris and has been since 2001. Often found next to Invader or M. CHAT, John is a mystery and a joke in the art world. His motto is 'It is the promotion that makes the artist or the zero degree of art.' Recently, John has shown a lot of interest developing ideas around AR and Metaverse/NFTs. He has reached out to Coralorca after a Twitter follow, and they talked about doing some nounish things together, starting with a noggles campaign.   \n## VALUE PROPOSITION\nIt is interesting for NounsDAO to position themselves along something mysterious that comes from the streets, from the art world, and support artists while doing so. People will notice the glasses and wonder what it all means, it will trigger their imagination and curiosity. On top of that, France has a strong Web3 community that will surely notice. \n## SCOPE OF THE PROJECT\nA total of 1000 wheat posters and John will change his PFP on twitter and instagram during the campaign. \n500 posters 70*100cm in Paris, with 10 of them in a circular “profile picture” 100cm*100cm format.\n250 posters 70*100cm in Marseille, with 10 of them in a circular “profile picture” 100cm*100cm format.\n250 70*100cm in Lyon, with 10 of them in a circular “profile picture” 100cm*100cm format.\n+ a bonus projection on the BNF (National French Library) similar to picture below\n![Artist Projection Mockup](https://www.jiji-studio.com/assets/JohnHamonBNF.png)\nJohn will make sure this is well documented with short movies and pictures. I also have contacts in Paris if we need additional videos.\nSome quick mockups by the artist:\n![Artist Mockups](https://www.jiji-studio.com/assets/JohnHamonMockups.png)\nRegarding legality: the posters will be placed on tolerated areas like construction sites, public poster boards etc And the circular ones will be placed where there are already a few invaders and other street artists, where it is tolerated.\nCoral Orca will organize a street marketing campaign next to the posters with chalk stencils. We decided to have the noggles in different colors as well and not show any website url - keep it mysterious for now. \nJohn will also post on his instagram account about the campaign and modify his profile picture to add the nouns glasses.\n## LINKS\nhttps://www.instagram.com/john_hamon/ (250K followers)\nhttps://www.compulsivecontents.com/detail-event/the-mysterious-face-of-paris/\n## PROJECT TIMELINE\nEnd of August 2022 for Marseille.\nSeptember-October 2022  for Paris and Lyon (When everyone in France is back to the city to work)\n## TEAM\nJohn Hamon https://twitter.com/johnhamon_ \nCoral Orca https://twitter.com/coralorca \n## COMPENSATION\nWe are asking for a total of 22 ETH - 15 for John and his team, 5.5 for the stencil campaign, and 1.5 for Coral Orca for organizing it. \n## TRANSACTIONS\n15 ETH to 0xbb3844536bcb17c20b36da2ec20f90a03865c945\n7 ETH to 0x8833Db8110D54c5632B67b83441AccbdA5B23bF4\n\n"},{"blockNumber":15305480,"blockHash":"0x85b1126fc389f14570831346252b09dbc228c8ec61da622800a1eb14b6f64ed0","transactionIndex":163,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x1ab876d015e762de4146293ebb5bbaf09f2d96531d05465f8265648901b4a956","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":127,"proposer":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","targets":["0xbe04BDD360FaeE5A3cFC407c4Cd3325c24BdE8b9"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15318620,"endBlock":15338330,"description":"# Nouns x Dopamine\n\ntl:dr: Dopamine & Apenoun propose to collaborate on a limited-supply Nounish non-fungible streetwear drop to be released at the Dopamine product launch event at Art Basel Miami in December.

We are homegrown web3 natives aiming to bridge the gap between streetwear & crypto culture.\n\nInspired by Nouns DAO, our membership structure has a Nounish distribution, and we’ll be kicking off our auctions later this year. Holders of Dopamine Membership NFTs determine the creative direction of Dopamine, in addition to revenue sharing and perks at our IRL events.\n\nAs a streetwear-focused web3 project our goal is to bridge the divide between the physical and digital worlds. Though we recognise the growing market for digital-only fashion, as Hypebeasts who tend to spend [an insane amount of money](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/streetwear-supreme-fans-spending-habits/) on streetwear and [sneakers](https://stockx.com/news/sneakerheads-spend-10-of-income-on-kicks/#), we love our physical pieces and really couldn’t live without them.\n\nIn contrast to a project like RTFKT for example we are physical-first, meaning that upon physical delivery of our garments, customers must scan a microchip to authenticate ownership, after which they will receive the bundled NFTs.\n\nIt’s undeniable that NFTs have unleashed a new cultural revolution, putting the creative power in the hands of digital artists, musicians, and photographers, and creating an exploding market for digital collectibles. This is the energy we want to bring to streetwear.\n\nSo we’re taking the best of both worlds as physicals take us off our screens and bring us together through something tactile, while NFTs unlock a new world with limitless creative possibilities.\n\nThe Dopamine Team is thrilled to collaborate with Apenoun to design a limited-supply Nouns-inspired non-fungible streetwear bundle for the Dopamine Marketplace launch at Art Basel Miami. With this collab we hope to push the Nounish culture forward and proliferate the Nouns meme and brand across the Metaverse and into mainstream pop culture.\n\n\n## **Non-Fungible Streetwear Bundles**\n\nThe main product Dopamine offers partners are limited-edition “non-fungible streetwear bundles” consisting of these parts:\n\n- The physical streetwear piece embedded with the Dopamine microchip.\n- The “physical-bound NFT” (PNFT), a digital 3D model of the piece, forever cryptographically bound to the microchip.\n- “Accessory NFTs”, which could include digital art, represent brand loyalty or event perks, or any other creative expression partners wish to include in the bundle.\n\n![dopamine2|690x388](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F75a968c0-03ba-467c-8271-032bd8679892%2FScreenshot_2022-08-01_at_12.07.54.png?table=block&id=0876c198-98e2-4ea3-bd2a-816177363ff5&spaceId=ba19d8ff-64a6-48a3-b1b8-4d690f10f95f&width=2000&userId=f55ed8db-e5a2-4f22-a7b5-744d0899742f&cache=v2)\n\n\n## **Dopamine Studio Curation**\n\nDopamine Studio is the one-stop shop for brands and creators to create Non-Fungible Streetwear either from scratch or by bundling their already existing merchandise. \n\nThis product is intended to be released nearing Q1, providing a Manifold-like experience to end-to-end collection curation made specially for streetwear. Before that, Dopamine will offer this service to partners on a case-by-case consultancy basis, with Nouns as one of the first partners.\n\n![dopamine3|690x388](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F0d708d0b-ab63-4ec1-a265-78ae6af0aab3%2F4_4.png?table=block&id=9d06c861-10a8-45a4-8f5b-2dc45e2e8a98&spaceId=ba19d8ff-64a6-48a3-b1b8-4d690f10f95f&width=2000&userId=f55ed8db-e5a2-4f22-a7b5-744d0899742f&cache=v2)\n\n## **Supported Customizations**\n\n- 3D PNFT Design\n    - The media file for the PNFT (that which is directly bound to the garment through our Microchip) will feature a 3D rendition of the physical garment.\n- Accessory NFT Designs / Media Uploads\n    - Each Non-Fungible Streetwear Piece may be bundled with additional accessory media files bundled as NFTs. These can be alternative skins, complementary music files, avatars, etc.\n- Collection-specific Specs\n    - These will include royalties, distribution strategies (e.g. fixed-price sale vs. DAs), NFT types, etc.\n\nDopamine will work closely with Apenoun to create a fully on-brand Nouns Streetwear Bundle, with specifications that fit with the Nouns ethos.\n\n## **Creator Flow**\n\n![dopamine4|690x233](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fa39b45a6-b503-466c-83a6-ce00964ec3dd%2FScreen_Shot_2022-07-29_at_1.29.11_AM.png?table=block&id=aa58afb1-2776-42cf-9697-b2d8a7c09e83&spaceId=ba19d8ff-64a6-48a3-b1b8-4d690f10f95f&width=2000&userId=f55ed8db-e5a2-4f22-a7b5-744d0899742f&cache=v2)\n\n## **Dopamine Microchips**\n\nDopamine microchips are two-sided, 27mm round, 1mm thick NFC chips with silver foliage.

Spearheaded by [Toady Hawk](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk), [Ser Noadz](https://twitter.com/thenoadz) and [Noun 142](https://twitter.com/1fortytwo), administered by a talented committee of Nounish builders, and supported by a growing international community.\n\nAfter a two week unpaid experiment, plus a one month funded trial ([Prop 101](https://nouns.wtf/vote/101)), we believe we have proven our worth to the Nouns ecosystem, both as a daily touchpoint for the community, and as a powerful onboarding tool for Nouns-curious passers-by the world over. We are requesting funding to continue running and growing the show for the remainder of the 2022 calendar year.\n\n## Accomplishments\n* **58 Consecutive Daily Spaces**, none missed. \n* **A 24-hour Twitter Space** for the nouniverse with over 60 Nounish guests and 1,400+ attendees from all over the world (attendance never dropped below 100 unique listeners all night and day.)\n* **3 successful Coordinape Rounds** completed, awarding USDC to a total of 12 unique contributing members. Pioneering completely decentralized rewards-based compensation based loosely on Nouncil model. **Average compensation per contributor $1,500 USDC per round.**   \n* **120 Daily Attendees on average**, with some shows as high as 400.\n* **Surpassed our metrics** for the entire one month trial in just 2 weeks, and have now in some cases doubled expectations.\n\n\n### Our Stated Goals from Proposal 101\nScreenshot from Prop:\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-07-19-at-4-59-28-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/4dbt6VBr/Screen-Shot-2022-07-19-at-4-59-28-PM.png)](https://postimg.cc/62qyw2s0)\n\n### Our Actual Metrics to Date:\n\n* 1.2M Tweet Impressions(!!) (More than 2X of goal)\n* 1,750 Followers (1.5X goal)\n* Average attendance: 120 per day \n* FOMO players: average 50 per day\n* 1,650 Contest Entries (2X of goal)\n\n\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-08-09-at-4-12-11-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/hPHTSfFF/Screen-Shot-2022-08-09-at-4-12-11-PM.png)](https://postimg.cc/9rYrbXF1)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SINfRWV.png)\n\n\n\n\n### We Also Achieved All Broader Goals from Prop 101\n\n[![broad-goals-check.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/d1SJ4cm8/broad-goals-check.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/wyLKjPrv)\n\n## Amazing Nounish Content\n\n### Engaging Contests\n* **6 weeks+ of consecutive contests**: awarded over 11 ETH in prizes to creative and talented Nounsfolk. Contests have resulted in over 1,650 unique pieces of user-created Nounish art/content so far, and has spawned at least 3 individual Nounish art collections.\n\n[![nounish-cloud.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/N0Zrqbzh/nounish-cloud.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/R3Q0w1mG)\n\n* Among the winning entries of these contests have been some truly incredible pieces of art, including this Watercolor Cloud Noun by [Jheeart_NFT](https://twitter.com/jheeart_nft). \n    * We helped this artist to create a collection \"With Noun\" using Manifold, and release the piece as an NFT (which sold for 0.69!) and she is releasing more pieces in the same style, [you can see the collection here.](https://opensea.io/collection/withnoun)  \n* **Our show has become an efficient marketing tool** to discover and recruit new artists & builders for Nouns DAO. With contests we are able to identify top talent and funnel it to Small Grants or Prop House to onboard to building for Nouns!\n\n### Some Other Example Contest Entries \n\n*Contest entry from Yujujae 유주재 ⌐ⓝ°ⓒ 청어*\n[![yacht-club-conetest.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/xqVqMNyB/yacht-club-conetest.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/BPNqG6zC)\n\n\n*Nouniversary contest entry by Jhee:* [![jhee-nouniversary.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/hhRRp9Yb/jhee-nouniversary.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/hQsYG7cf) \n\n*Nouniversary contest entry by Skwalo691*\n[![clock-contest-entry.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/pdzGJwH7/clock-contest-entry.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/QBNJXnVk)\n\n*This physical oil painting contest entry from Sasohan*\n[![van-gogh-noggles.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/bN49Vm3j/van-gogh-noggles.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/D8dG8d9C)\n\n### Awesome Guests\n\nDeezeFi (twice), David Horvath, Taco Noun, Salvino, Oni, Messhup, Brennen, Grammy-winning Musician Violetta Zironi (who performed live), Stoopid Buddy, Jack Butcher and more.\n\n### A Platform for Builders\n\nWe provide a live and engaged audience for builders to update the audience on the progress of their projects. This is a very effective way for builders to get attention to their work.\n\n### FOMO Engagement: Just Look At Those Nouns\nThrough increased FOMO engagement, we have helped mint some truly beautiful Nouns (including an incredible triple Void run!)\n\n[![sexy-nouns.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/TPyq8KQs/sexy-nouns.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/CZgfkL3C)\n\n### Using POAPs to Gamify Participation and Give a Platform to Artists\n\nWe have given a daily POAP to attendees of The Noun Square every day since our inception. This is the purest use case for the protocol, and works well for us to incentivize people to attend our Twitter spaces, play FOMO live and participate in our contests. \n\nAdditionally, this has allowed us to feature the art of talented established artists like Ser Noadz, Sam Ellis, SuperTightWoody and Greta Grempllin, as well as giving exposure to talented new creators like [0xAprilia](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock/status/1555013482222870528?s=20&t=l1iqwV_VBZS7cDVu0b6HNw), [Illustradora.eth](https://twitter.com/ilustradoraeth/status/1556418817244422144?s=20&t=l1iqwV_VBZS7cDVu0b6HNw) and [Leetlestar](https://twitter.com/hapsigmi/status/1556802875111550976?s=20&t=l1iqwV_VBZS7cDVu0b6HNw). \n\nWe also plan to continue to use the data from these POAP distributions in the future to do token-gated raffles and contests that reward past participants and strengthen our community.\n\n## Bonus Things We've Done That We Didn't Even Say We'd Do\n\n* **24-hour Nouniversary Celebration**: an audacious [Twitter Space](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock/status/1556348069662412802) on the Nouniversary with dozens of guests booked, contests, games and more. \n    * Over 1,400+ unique attendees, attendance never dropped below 100 at any time.\n    * 50+ Nounish guests\n    * Amazing community shared moments.\n* **Nounish NFT collections:** We have helped community members to set up Nounish NFT collections based on their Noun Square contest entries using Manifold. \n* **International outreach:** We have done outreach to international audiences by hosting non-English Spaces on some Saturdays, and making foreign-language channels in Discord with moderation.\n* **Community involvement in DAO governance:** Noun 142 Delegated his Noun to The Noun Square multisig so that we could initiate an Audience Voting initiative. \n    * We invite proposers to pitch their proposals to the audience.\n    * The audience then votes live in our discord.\n    * We then execute the voted on-chain accordingly. \n    * This has been a popular segment, and we look forward to expanding on the experiment in future.\n\n\n## The Future of the Noun Square\nWe hope the above sections paint a clear picture of all the accomplishments our team has achieved over the past 6 weeks, meeting or exceeding all the engagement goals we set for ourselves in Prop 101. \n\nThe Purpose of this Proposal is to ask the DAO to fund our proven team for an additional 5 months, until the end of the calendar year, to do the following:\n\n* **Continue to plan and execute daily Twitter Spaces**: Engage newcomers, Nouners and Nouns community members alike, with informative guests and fun contests that produce a plethora of Nouns-based art and authentic social media engagement.\n* **Continue to organize Contests for our community**: Using data from our trial, we have found that 1-2 weekly contests with larger prizes are both more effective and less administratively onerous compared to daily contests. We would plan to move forward with 1-2 contests per week with prizes ranging from 0.05-1ETH, which will no doubt encourage more thoughtful and skillful entries (while also peppering in smaller contests live on the show for variety.)  \n* **Innovate on contest voting and prize administration:** We have spoken with Nounder Seneca and, if funded, plan to move forward with an implementation of **Prop House** for our contest entries to be voted on weekly, as an alternative to the current system of emoji voting in Discord. \n* **Work with the [Noun O'Clock Web App](https://prop.house/proposal/777) team:** Iterate with the team to ship a product with product-market fit and integrate these clients with our own site and daily Spaces as much as possible. \n\n### Areas of Focus\n\nOur vision for TNS in the next 5 months:\n\n* **International growth:** As we enter a European/APAC friendly Noun O Clock, we want to seize the opportunity to introduce Nouns to these regions of the world even more than we already have been.\n* **Be a leading onboarding funnel to Nouns:** We have seen initial signs that our show is a great vehicle to onboard artists, builders, and future Nouners to the DAO. We want to lean into this and make sure our show becomes a strong funnel into nouns.\n* **Expand to new channels:** We want to explore growth opportunities via new channels like podcast platforms, Youtube, TikTok and Twitch.\n* **The Noun Square as a platform for builders:** We want to keep attracting talent to build on top of our show. Two teams ([NOC nouns client](https://prop.house/proposal/777) & [NOC Onboarding Materials](https://prop.house/proposal/864)) have already won prop house funding to build specifically on top of the Noun Square show, in addition to the previously mentioned artists whose collections have been prompted by our contests, and we hope to see more in the coming months.\n\n### So what does success look like at the end of 2022?\n* Grow our twitter followers from 1,600 to 5,000+\n* Average daily attendance by end of year 200+\n* 5,000+ contest entries\n* International growth: Our goal is to contribute to growing a much larger international noun ecosystem by end of year. We have already started this outreach and plan to continue with more foreign language \"takeover\" spaces on the weekends, and focus on non-English accessibility in Discord and Twitter.  \n\n\n### Budget\n\nMonthly Operations Costs: \n* **Contest Prizes:** 10 ETH\n* **Team Compensation and Administration:** 50 ETH per month, allocated by Committee Coordinape on a Biweekly basis.\n* **Time Period:** 5 months until end of 2022. \n* 5 x 60 ETH = 300 ETH\n**Total Proposal Ask: 300 ETH**\n(Cost of 3 Daily Nouns Auctions for 5 months of daily Nounish multimedia content and organic social media engagement.) \n\n\n### Team\n\nWe will continue with our \"3C Model\" of governance and accountability:\n\n**Core (Founding) Team (Responsible for Execution):**\n\nToady Hawk\nNoun 142\nSer Noadz\n\n**Council (Responsible for Decisions and Daily Direction)**\n\nAubtoshi\nBenbodhi\nSuperTightWoody\nRyanMac21\n!Xargs\nSam Ellis\nMaty.eth\nJoshua Fisher\n\n\n*Members of this committee may rotate depending on timezones, availability, etc. New incoming Committee members from APAC timezones will most probably include 0xigami, Goldy, Mr. Boney, Mintfaced, and more.*\n\n### Community (Talent Funnel for Council)\n\nAnyone in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/VQxv2BFw39) and Twitter communities can join and participate in all our public channels to help with contest ideas, guest ideas, and more, and can apply to join the Organizing Committee at any time. We have forked Nouncil governance with procedures for adding/removing contributing committee members at any time. \n\nThe above organizational strategy (modeled loosely on Nouncil) allows us enough structure to execute on a daily basis, as well as enough flexibility to adapt to new timezones and other challenges as they may arise.\n\n\n## Strategy for North American \"Nouns Winter\"\n\nNOC happening during North American late night/early morning may have some impact on our attendance rate, although we have been attracting a sizable audience from Europe and Asia already (for example, during our recent 24H long Nouniversary Spaces, attendance never dropped below 100 even during NA non-peak hours.) Nonetheless, we think of this as an opportunity rather than a challenge: \n\n### Proliferation opportunity\n* Auction times drifting enable fairer distribution of nouns across the globe. **We think of our show drifting with NOC as giving a fairer opportunity for Noun proliferation outside of the Americas timezones**\n*  We will have the opportunity to **engage with international guests**, and introduce our nounish energy to a new audience. \n\n### Host Recruiting & Scaling Ops\n\n* **We have begun recruiting additional hosts** and administrative helpers from Europe and APAC timezones so that we can smoothly transition into North American night.\n* Several of our Committee members are also excited to continue hosting/attending the show well into the North American night. \n* We are **already pulling in an impressive daily audience from Europe, Australia and Asia** (especially Japan and Korea.) \n* We plan to work with members of NounsDAOJapan, NounsDAO Brazil and GnarsDAO (Australia based) to continue to pull in new viewers and new Nounsfolk even through the North American early morning hours.\n\n\n\n### New distribution channels\n\n* We will begin posting recordings of our daily spaces both on a **podcast server and on Youtube**, so that North American audiences will still be able to listen and interact with our content daily. \n* We will also experiment with doing trial versions of The Noun Square on **Youtube, Twitch, and TikTok Live** to test engagement on those mediums. \n\n### Scaling with systems\n* Our team has created a robust Notion for knowledge management with **Planning Documents, Tracking Databases and Daily Run-of-Show Templates** to enable onboarding of new hosts and contributors as easy and decentralized as possible.\n\n\n## LFG!\n\nWe were funded for a trial and have surpassed all goals and metrics by a large margin, going above and beyond with initiatives such as the 24 hour Nouniversary Spaces. \n\nWe represent a group of committed Nounish builders with a good track record of success, and we are asking for the DAO's trust, as we lean into a very successful concept and continue to improve, grow and scale this new platform centred around the daily Noun O' Clock. \n\nWe believe that in a short time, The Noun Square has become the defacto watercooler of the Nounish ecosystem, as well as an impressive funnel for new Noun owners, artists and builders. \n\nWe are excited by how much more we can do if given a mandate to keep on building throughout the remainder of 2022. \n\n**Thank you for your support, and we look forward to having you as a guest on the show one day soon!**"},{"blockNumber":15321655,"blockHash":"0x7b6bcc21efe4468c61bc061d55381139607c3b9850c4b25032d1863e16684e02","transactionIndex":43,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x4b0c3bf6dc3c24d82cb65b7897f308d1903d480a7b34309ce96bc661bd0c01f6","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":129,"proposer":"0x3496f3600070CC01d9665d1057F6F39afC0fe149","targets":["0xff8EB6Aa355B117746d779d5b2B71D0A9377421d"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15334795,"endBlock":15354505,"description":"# Nounify New York Fashion Week\n\n![NOUNS1234.png](https://polished-walrus-b42.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fa049a25e-253b-45f9-bb78-e973b8065703%2FNOUNS1234.png?table=block&id=bbedeb12-c914-4bf8-9218-8c3078a11340&spaceId=aaa84961-448d-41f3-9787-b37867da72d8&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n*This is 0xBobatea, I'm submitting this proposal on behalf of my friends at Advisry:\n\nWe want to Nounify New York Fashion week! By branding and collaborating on Advisry’s official calendar runway show in September, we will introduce nouns to fashion in an illustrious way.\n\n**Why?**\n\nNouns has effortlessly aligned itself with all realms of high art. As a young fashion label, we are aware of the shift in culture and believe the Nouns Glasses logo is the Nike swoosh of web3. We feel it is necessary for Nouns to be represented in the most iconic facet of fashion culture, the fashion runway show.\n\n**Nouns x Advisry Experience**\n\nWhat Nouns is working towards in the future of web3 aligns closely with the overall goals of Advisry. Advisry and Nouns both strive to build communities to give individuals a voice and platform to express themselves and their ideas on a bigger scale. \n\nThe Advisry X Nouns experience involves “In Real Life” events that bring our conglomerates together to communicate the importance of unity and change. Advisry wants to involve web3 in fashion and continue aligning with Nouns on potential future projects. \n\n**How**\n\nTo Nounify the show and after party, we will:\n\n- Provide Advisry X Nouns POAPs to onboard show guests.\n- Provide Nouns gifts for every show guest.\n- Brand Nouns EVERYWHERE at the venue for the show and after party.\n- Include Nouns pieces & looks designed by Keith Herron on the runway.\n- Film a documentary of the process of Nounifying NYFW.\n\n**The Show**\n\nIn September Advisry will be showing their first womenswear collection at New York Fashion Week. The collection titled, “Masculin Feminin” aims to capture gender inclusivity through 32 looks of traditional and nontraditional womenswear. \n\n**Nouns On The Runway**\n\nAdvisry will include Nouns Sunglasses that will be featured in one of the looks in the runway show. Along with this, one of the models will graze the runway with the Nouns Soft Trunk. There will be two Nouns-themed looks in the show.\n\n![nouns soft trunk.png](https://polished-walrus-b42.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F3f9c2296-0f88-4cad-9653-e37319381ee3%2Fnouns_soft_trunk.png?table=block&id=30217e74-922a-4901-9f78-9c2fe4257837&spaceId=aaa84961-448d-41f3-9787-b37867da72d8&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n**THE NOUNS SOFT TRUNK**\n\nThe soft trunk design is a reference and ode to custom Goyard and Gucci trunks made for their premier clients. They Screenprint their client’s names and or logos on the baggage to make them custom. The more thoughtful side of the design is the altering of the trunk itself - changing it from wooden frame structure to a more soft leather structure, similar to a luxury duffle. This trunk design is intended to be immediately iconic due to the pure crossover of a nouns logo with Advisry’s monogram print.\n\n- A classical trunk shape & hardware, but no wooden frame - it will be made of vegan leather with gold plated .925 silver hardware - structured so it will maintain shape\n- The classic Advisry checkerboard monogram will be embossed into the leather - the nouns glasses will be screenprinted on the bag\n- Made in Italy\n\n**Venue**\n\nThe show will take place in the *Oculus NYC*, an artistic landmark located at The World Trade Center. We will be the first of many fashion brands to utilize this as a show space, which is on its way to becoming one of the new homes of New York Fashion Week.\n\nThe Oculus NYC is located in one of the most heavily foot trafficked areas in all of New York. The building is packed with many storefronts, an NJTransit & major MTA station hub, and was once even home to a Kanye West music video in 2019.  \n\n![Untitled](https://polished-walrus-b42.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fce2080fd-6ae6-4d01-b027-ba4995832001%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=d57f7ed1-c590-4088-8e11-a62f04b37034&spaceId=aaa84961-448d-41f3-9787-b37867da72d8&width=1460&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n![Untitled](https://polished-walrus-b42.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fd498554e-5c90-4cc2-a6cd-142be2f2c8ae%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=6aa96ec1-ce6d-4561-ae46-a754bac567bb&spaceId=aaa84961-448d-41f3-9787-b37867da72d8&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n**Set Production**\n\n- Dress the runway with Parisian style cafe chairs and tables where guests will be seated\n- Light the show with Parisian style street lamps that are manually operated to highlight models by turning on and off as they walk the runway\n\n**Proposal**\n\n**Fund Advisry to:**\n\n- Occupy the Oculus NYC space for the show and after party\n- Produce all garments and accessories for the show\n- Execute the set design of the show\n- Create collaborative pieces to seed and sell to Nouns new and growing audience of luxury consumers\n- Build out a team to produce, fabricate, style, cast, and model the *Masculin Feminin* Show\n- Brand Nouns throughout the venue using Vinyl, Signage, Video, and more\n\n**Branding**.\n\n- Nouns X Advisry T-shirt collaboration to be gifted and/or sold at the after party\n- Nouns branded drinks at the after party\n- Nouns signage and video being played throughout the venue\n- Nouns branding on all invites and Ads posted by Advisry\n\n**Billboard: a 60’ x 12’ Nouns billboard placed outside of the Oculus, designed by Advisry’s creative director, Keith Herron. This billboard will reach beyond our fashion week audience and be seen by the heavy traffic of tourists and locals walking through the historic Oculus Space.**  \n\nAccording to the City of New York data last updated on June 30 2022, the Oculus has an average foot traffic of 16,000 people per day\n\n**Documentation**\n\nWe want to create a documentary that captures behind the scenes footage of the Nounification of New York Fashion Week! \n\nTelling the story of how an IRL fashion show can be realized with a Nouns collaboration speaks to how valuable, versatile, and functional the DAO is. The documentary would be the first of its kind and a timeless piece in a world where web3 and the high arts will one day seamlessly grow and work together. \n\nWe would work to publish this documentary on a fashion youtube channel like Vogue, GQ, Etc. \n\n*We are interested in working with the creators of **Prop 73, Stoopid Buddy Doc** to film and produce the documentary but have not yet been in contact with them.* \n\n**How does this benefit Nouns**\n\nNew York Fashion Week is one of the most iconic and respected events in the global fashion industry. By working side by side we will transform the view of Nouns as not only having a “luxury” side of the brand with sunglasses and high quality garments, but also having a leg in the always changing industry of fashion.\n\nNouns holders in NYC will have the opportunity to place their name on our guest list for the runway show and all after parties using an alias to keep identities private.\n\nA multi-faceted branding opportunity that not only reaches the show audience but also the city of New York\n\n**Visibility**\n\nWith past coverage from Vogue, GQ, Forbes, WWD, CFDA, and more we believe we can bring Nouns to the forefront of fashion journalism. \n\nThese platforms will put Nouns on hundreds of thousands of peoples radar if not more. Vogue, GQ, and WWD alone average over 5 to 10 million monthly website viewers and have a combined following of over 100 million people on all of their social media platforms.\n\n**Why work with Advisry?**\n\nAdvisry is a fashion, film, and music label based in NYC. Keith Herron, 22 year old founder and designer, began Advisry when he was in 8th grade and has been growing the brand ever since. Keith has sold Advisry to 35 different countries, was awarded the Gucci Changemakers scholarship and was most recently added to the Designer’s Hub of CFDA: a members-only incubator of American Designers joining the likes of Marc Jacobs, Rick Owens, Virgil Abloh, and many more.\n\nLast spring Advisry debuted on the runway at NYFW. In his first live show, Keith designed 37 looks and packed out the venue with over 150 people in attendance. \n\nThe fashion industry is very gate kept. There is no actual way to break through the industry in an official way without working with a brand that has already broken through. Historically, the way brands get the opportunity to be on the official fashion calendar is by spending many seasons producing their own runway shows independent of the fashion calendar, hoping to gain the attention of the CFDA. \n\nThe benefit of collaborating with Advisry is it gives Nouns an authentic introduction and inclusion into the fashion industry. Not only is Advisry an up and coming line making a lot of noise for its unique approach, but the brand has also collaborated on web3 drops in the past. Keith was the designer of the Advisry X CreatureWorld clothing collection, one of the most successful physical web3 drops to date. \n\n**Collaborators**  \n\n- **Jean-Michel Basquiat Collaboration**\n\nAdvisry and [The Estate of Jean-Michel Basqiuat](https://www.basquiat.com/) are collaborating on 10 different pieces that will be debuted on the Advisry runway and be shown later on in the month at the Basqiuat museum. This is among the first collaborations ever that the family of Jean-Michel personally handpicked and approved. The pieces are the first of their kind to utilize never before seen artworks by Jean-Michel.\n\nThe fashion show will be closed with three Jean-Michel Basquiat collaboration looks as [Lolo Zouai](https://instagram.com/lolozouai?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) and the orchestra play a cover performance of Tu M’as Trop Ment. \n\n- **Adidas Collaboration**\n\nAdvisry and Adidas are collaborating on a shoe silhouette designed by Keith Herron that will be featured on many looks throughout the runway show. The shoes will be constructed by hand in New York City\n\n- **NOUNS Collaboration**\n\nFeatured as one of few collaborations in the fashion show alongside **Adidas** and **Basquiat,** with a trunk designed by Keith Herron alongside highlighting the physical glasses on the models. The Nouns collaboration completes the trio - highlighting fine art, heritage footwear, and the future of intellectual property.\n\n**Budget**\n\n*All production costs of the show will be split with Advisry evenly*\n\nNouns collaboration production: **$25,500**\n\n- Nouns x Advisry Soft Trunks: $1,500\n- Nouns Branding: $10,000\n- Clothing Production: $14,000\n\nVenue: **$11,500**\n\n- Rental Price: $10,000\n- Insurance: $1,500\n\nSet Design: **$10,000**\n\n- Cafe table and chair rentals: $5,000\n- Parisian style street lamps: $2,000\n- Audio: $2,000\n- Lighting: $1,000\n\nTeam: **$5,000**\n\n- Producer: $2,000\n- Stylist: $1,000\n- Show runner: $500\n- Models: $1,500\n\n**Total: ~$52,000**\n\n***33 ETH***"},{"blockNumber":15344690,"blockHash":"0xcd7f3b9b7c4919dae98695fe19d0a72df3c25ff54e0e281c7e22e1df978175f5","transactionIndex":31,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x79743856267bfa1fcd9baa8664ef56bdda4aa92c4f2906739c84b107a51e5c5f","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":130,"proposer":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","targets":["0xC185d966F64480BEDb2ED458E7d1A1e29d95231C"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15357830,"endBlock":15377540,"description":"# Nouns Almanac Second Edition\n\n## TL;DR:\n**The Nouns Almanac Second Edition book development extends the Nouns featured in the First Edition by another 256 Nouns, showcasing a total of 512 Nouns minted in 2021/2022.**\n\n---\n\n**Project: Nouns Almanac Second Edition\nOnchain Sponsor: [@Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi) (Nouncillor)\nFunding: 18.5 Ξ\nShip date: Dec 10th 2022** *(in time for Christmas shopping for kids presents)*\n\n---\n![](https://i.imgur.com/g7nzGhV.jpg)\n\n# What Is Nouns Almanac Second Edition\n\nThe Nouns Almanac Second Edition is a physical book featuring Nouns 257 - 512, following the First Edition that featured Nouns 0 - 256.

I was introduced to Nouns by Euwyn (Noun #122 and #341), and fell enamored with the sense of community I’ve observed so far. Nounish-ness is special, and I’d love to bottle up a bit of this and spread the word about Nouns to larger audience.\n\nThis proposal is for a community-driven, studio-quality animated short film starring a Noun, with a red carpet event in Los Angeles to cap off production and bring Nouns and film community members together to inspire more collaborations.\n\nWith an origin story of falling out of their owner’s laptop - think “Finding Nemo” - the protagonist Noun will be animated in stop-motion style, composited on real footage, and film their own journey home. With the Nouns community involvement at each step, the story will be written to be captivating to a broad international audience across different languages, crypto-native and not. \n\n## Why?\n\nAllow us to introduce you to: The Noun. An animated Noun, fallen out of his owner’s laptop and finding himself lost in the real world. Starting with an animated short, audiences worldwide will watch the charming, adorable, and sneakily snarky Noun overcome obstacles, find and lose love, and much more as he films his journey home. Modernizing the mold of fictional personalities like Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, or Annoying Orange, and inspired by early Pixar shorts, we aim to make the Noun into a well-loved, viral, memeable, sharable character. \n\nA big part of our effort will be involving the community in writing a unique, compelling narrative for the noun. As a storyteller, this is where I’ll be focused. The intimacy of telling his story from his POV, with his phone camera, intercut with 3rd-person footage of his adventures, will build a lasting emotional relationship with his audience that will transfer into future projects, from this team and others. Whether it be longer YouTube videos, a TV series, or even his own feature film, people will follow the Noun wherever he goes — in the world or online.\n\nHis story will be designed to be saturated with clipable, memeable, shareable moments that don’t need context to go viral on their own. However, for the curious viewer, the clips bring them in to a larger narrative designed and produced around a genuine story and loveable protagonist.\n\n## Community-Driven Production\n\nUltimately, we want the character, and the project as a whole, to be completely emblematic of all that is Nounish. Yes, this means quirkiness, humor, personality and spontaneity, but it also means myriad factors and traits we can’t even begin to predict. This is why throughout the entire creative process we will hold bi-weekly town halls to discuss the script and invite members to share their thoughts. The character bio, the general plot, the finished screenplay, design, locations, all of it. We promise to be receptive to feedback, and additionally will host community feedback sessions to ensure our protagonist is as Nounish as can be.\n\nAlong the Noun’s journey, he will inevitably interact with other characters and Nouns in the wild, and while the Noun overcomes loneliness, fear, and anxiety, the story will lead towards an ultimate message of the value of community and collective voice. This will open an opportunity for more creatives to build and expand upon what would effectively become the Nouns Cinematic Universe. Other writers, animators, directors, with their own backgrounds, aesthetic styles, and manners of storytelling, can build upon the framework Noun sets and expand with their own real-world Noun characters and stories.\n\nWe’re not only creating a viral character who will bring attention to the Nouns project, but a platform upon which like-minded creatives can find opportunities to build art.\n\n## Development\n\n\n### Pre-Production\n\n6-8 weeks\n\n- Writing\n- Location scouting\n- Establishing workflow for animation\n- Voice actor casting\n- The casting will likely be the longest part of pre-production. In building a project based around the personality of one protagonist, the casting is crucial. We do it once, we do it right.\n\n### Production\n\n6-8 weeks\n\n- Filming\n- Recording voice lines\n- Animation\n\n### Post-Production\n\n1-2 weeks\n\n- Hiring social media marketing specialist to maximize likelihood of going viral\n- Setting up digital marketing strategy (trending hashtags, etc)\n- Deploying the videos\n\n![Budget Breakdown](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/e/e272bac8a1a6e48b90b3caa34452bb40323cbf8e.jpeg)\n\n\nIt is our goal to create a professional, polished, award-worthy product. As such, we’re going to need a professional team. Above is our outlined 25 ETH budget, covering a worst-case scenario which can promise a perfect result. We will strive to remain under that budget, however, and any remaining surplus will go towards the following, which we hope piques your interest.\n\n## Los Angeles Red Carpet Premiere \n\nAs the Noun character falls into the real world, so to do we wish to bring this to life. To cap off production, we will host a screening event in Los Angeles with a Nouns step and repeat banner, red carpet, and more, inviting members of the Nouns and film community. It’ll be an opportunity to meet the team behind the project, celebrate together, and provide another occasion for the Nouns community to gather and grow.\n\n## The Team\n\nWho are we!? We’re (mostly) recent graduates out of LA and Austin, Texas, trying to carve our way creatively. With backgrounds in literature, screenwriting, film production, animation, and design, we’re coming together to build something not only with catchy style, but with weighted substance. We don’t just want to work with Nouns to make *something* — we believe we can make something *great.*\n\n**Fedja Celebic.**\nProducer, Writer, Director\n\n[Fedja](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fedja-celebic-853522199/) is a USC graduate with a degree that spanned all mediums of writing and a Masters in Literary Editing and Publishing, and has found his creative satisfaction in screenwriting and producing.

A white-labeled Nouns browser app will be used for scanning the patch to claim the NFT, as well as for authenticating and verifying the garment owner and manufacturer.* \n\n*Dopamine, as the first Nouns-fork to incorporate with fashion, would like to include Nouns’ drop as one of a select few to incorporate Dopamine’s new web3 streetwear technology (”Non-Fungible Streetwear”). Nouns streetwear will be sold both at the event and online.*\n\n*Funds requested are 62-82Ξ, with 85% of the primary sales revenue going to the Nouns treasury.*\n\n![Noggles](https://i.imgur.com/6dxtUlx.jpg)\n\n# Introduction\n\nDopamine is thrilled to collaborate with Apenoun to design a limited-supply Nouns-branded collection of NFT-bundled streetwear. The collection will feature ~500 Nouns streetwear garments, each of which will be patched with a cryptographic NFC chip connecting on-chain to a Nouns-branded NFT that can be authenticated and claimed through a white-labeled Nouns browser app. The branding and experience for this drop will be Nounish end-to-end, and will fully incorporate Dopamine’s new “Non-Fungible Streetwear” technology.\n\n[Dopamine](http://dopamine.xyz/) is the first Nouns-fork to incorporate fashion, with the mission to empower Web3 projects, NFT artists, and collectors through a community-owned ecosystem for Non-Fungible Streetwear. We are crypto natives with a passion for streetwear culture and web3 technology, aiming to bridge the gap between these two worlds. \n\nOriginally inspired by Nouns’ creative governance and community model, we want to become an incubator for up-and-coming streetwear designers and NFT artists and recreate the “Nouns Virtuous Cycle” for the budding web3 streetwear industry. \n\nWith this collab we’re aiming to push the Nounish culture forward and proliferate the Nouns meme and brand across the Metaverse and into mainstream pop culture using a powerful vehicle for hype: streetwear.\n\n# Designs\n\nDopamine will work closely with Apenoun to design the garments, which will feature the Noggles and the Nouns slogan “One Noun, Every day, Forever.” Around 500 pieces will be made in total, featuring a combination of t-shirts, hoodies, and various other apparel. Quality-wise, this drop will have a premium feel reminiscent of brands such as Fear of God or Acne Studios, leveraging entirely cut and sew assembly. In terms of past experience, Dopamine’s design team has worked with the likes of Billie Eilish, Young Thug’s Spider, and Siberia Hills. \n\nIn addition to the merchandise design, each garment will feature a Nouns clothing patch covering the NFC chip used to connect to its bound Nouns NFT, which itself will include a digital 3D design of the garment along with additional digital accessories (see next section). Finally, the patch itself will also be capable of triggering an AR hologram of the underlying digital design.\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/kLfrWi5.jpg)\n\n![2](https://i.imgur.com/kJYBPNF.png)\n\n![3](https://i.imgur.com/63NDcOM.jpg)\n\n![4](https://i.imgur.com/9eqWRdI.jpg)\n\n![5](https://i.imgur.com/FkUXpDq.jpg)\n\n![6](https://i.imgur.com/Axt3asS.png)\n\n![7](https://i.imgur.com/7sRU8u4.jpg)\n\nWe are continuing to iterate with Apenoun on additional designs while ensuring the entire drop remains cohesive.\n\n![8](https://i.imgur.com/31n8Mwe.png)\n\n![9](https://i.imgur.com/p8teGhg.png)\n\n# Non-Fungible Streetwear Technology\n\nDopamine is creating a decentralized fashion technology platform for authenticating and sharing a new form of chip-microchipped streetwear that we call **“Non-Fungible Streetwear”**.\n\nAt the core of each Non-Fungible Streetwear piece is a **physical-bound NFT (PNFT)**, an NFT *forever bound* to the garment through an on-chain registry that uses chip-generated ECDSA signatures for resolution, whose media represents a 3D model of the physical streetwear piece. \n\nBy scanning the garment’s patched chip with Dopamine’s white-labeled browser app, garment owners will be able to claim the PNFT, authenticate collection and manufacturer details, and view digital renditions of their streetwear in a 3D-like wardrobe. On top of this, PNFTs may be composed with arbitrary numbers of other digital assets, such as NFTs representing brand-related digital art, music, or perks. \n\nBelow, we dive into more detail on the customization process, on-chain connectivity layer, and scanning flow as it relates to Nouns’ curated Non-Fungible Streetwear collection. \n\n### Customization Process\n\n![wip10](https://i.imgur.com/gErPzVi.jpg)\n\nThe following assets will be required for the Nouns’ Non-Fungible Streetwear collection:\n\n- **Nouns 3D PNFT Design**\nThe design file for the PNFT, which in this case will be a 3D digital rendition of the Nouns physical garment bundled as a GLTF file.\n- **Nouns Accessory Media Files**\nAdditional digital media files may be provided to build accessory NFTs. These could be anything from Nouns Art Basel POAPs to complementary Nouns digital avatars. Unlike the PNFTs which are forever bound to their garments, these accessory NFTs may be attached and detached on-chain to allow for composability with any Non-Fungible Streetwear pieces.\n- **Nouns PNFT Collection Specs**\nOwnership attribution for the Nouns’ Non-Fungible Streetwear will revolve around a custom ERC721-compatible Nouns PNFT collection with a fixed supply of ~500, reflecting the total number of garments distributed. Besides the aforementioned accessorizing, additional specs may be added here, such as collection-wide metadata or whitelisting support.\n\n### On-Chain Connectivity\n\n![11](https://i.imgur.com/zs3fcSV.png)\n\nConnection between Nouns streetwear garments to Nouns PNFTs will be entirely on-chain, and will involve three major components: \n\n**NFC Chip**\n\nDopamine NFC microchips are machine-washable ~30mm round, 1mm thick chips capable of signing messages. Scanning the patched chip will enable chip-signed attestations (secured at the firmware level) to be passed through the on-chain registry to the Nouns browser app for authentication and claiming.\n\n**Chip Registry**\n\nAn ENS-like on-chain registry mapping chip ids to PNFTs will be used for connecting physical and digital worlds together in a truly decentralized manner. Included in each record will be a pre-registered IPFS cert provided by Nouns (e.g. an attestation signed by Nouns Deployer) and the chip manufacturer. \n\n**Nouns PNFTs**\n\nNouns PNFTs will act as the virtual representation and authentication interface for the Nouns’ streetwear garments. Unlike most NFTs, which are normally only owned by a user EOA, these will include two forms of ownership attribution - one involving the garment owner, and one involving the paired chip itself. \n\n### Browser App\n\nThe three above components allow the white-labeled Nouns browser app to process claims, verifications, and transfers in a way that is truly 100% decentralized. Below, we outline at a high-level how claims and normal scans work:\n\n**Claims:**\n\n![12](https://i.imgur.com/KLykF7M.png)\n\nDopamine's Non-Fungible Streetwear uses a physical-first standard for claiming. This means that recipients of the Nouns’ Non-Fungible Streetwear collection will first get the physical garment, and then scan the patched chip using the Nouns browser app shown above to have the ownership attribution of the PNFT assigned to them. For security reasons, only addresses of those which have purchased the collection pieces (either online or live at Art Basel) will be able to invoke the initial claim.\n\n**Scans:**\n\n![13](https://i.imgur.com/uWHAKW2.png)\n\nAnyone with an NFC-enabled smart device will be able to tap their devices on the Nouns’ chip patches to view details regarding garment owner and authenticity through the Nouns browser app. In addition, these scans will showcase the PNFT media assets in an interactive 3D wardrobe-like environment, along with any bundled accessories.\n\n## Dopamineland @ **Art Basel Miami**\n\nThe Nouns x Dopamine drop will feature at our Art Basel Miami multi-day event “Dopamineland” as part of a select group of 5 partners representing the best and the brightest of web3 culture and meme power. \n\nThe Nouns area will be a fully Nouns-branded immersive experience featuring on-site “activations” giving users direct interaction with the Nouns bundles and their physical-digital features.\n\nNouns Non-Fungible Streetwear will be available for purchase on-site and online via credit card or ETH. For online orders, shipments will be handled through Shopify.\n\n## Nouns x Dopamine Bundle Cost Breakdown\n\nSupply: ~500 (TBD)\n\nCosts: ~82Ξ \n\nSupply: ~500 (TBD)\n\nCosts: ~62Ξ  - 82Ξ \n\n- Curation Fee (incl.

It’s a wild, novel genre that’s inspiring a new generation of creators, artists, and storytellers. \n\n### Click image to watch Blu present the proposal\n[![Image alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ktZaS52qyYA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktZaS52qyYA) \n\nWe’re a team of two with a shared passion for bringing avatars and worlds to life. We want to help bring Nouns into the 3D metaverse with our unique storytelling and world-building skills. We propose a XANADU x NOUNS collaboration consisting of two parts:\n\n### Part One - Nouns Episode of Xanadu \nWe would create a mega-episode of Xanadu where Blu, the hero of Xanadu, teams up with Nouns in an action-packed deep dive into the Nouns Universe.\n\nThe episode features Blu questing through Planet Nouns desperate for the Nouns help to save him from a posse of intergalactic gangsters. To satisfy the bounty on his head, Blu must submit a winning proposal to Nouns DAO which kicks off a wild escapade through the Nouns City Center, the historic Nouner Capitol building, and the Nouns Underground. Along the way, Blu meets a master Noun who gives him a crash course on NounsDAO, how it works and why it’s awesome — education disguised as Hollywood quality entertainment. But it doesn’t stop there…\n\n![Alt Text](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/e/e4951cf151fd7bfb2f983a7dbcb7ed901ce5614d.gif)\n\n### Part Two - CC0 Nouns Toolkit\nUnlike a Hollywood feature where all the creativity and work vanish after the movie’s made, all of the Nouns assets created for this episode will be crafted into a Nouns World Toolkit that will live on in an innovative and powerful new way — in the hands of the community, available CC0.\nThis is more than a simple library of assets…\n\nBecause Xanadu is built in a game engine (Unreal Engine 5), it’s a story world that can be cinematic, interactive, gamified, live-streamed, or experienced in VR. So, armed with this massive toolkit of AAA animatable Nouns characters & pre-lit, animated environments — complete with how-to guide books & tutorials created by us — the Nouns community can inhabit a Noun for VTubing, Zoom calls, or create cinematic content, marketing materials, NFTs, or even build a Nouns VR experience, game, or metaverse. It’s our hope for this to become the beginning of a dynamic Nouns repository that grows over time and is contributed to by other builders. (Full list of Toolkit deliverables below in Extra Details)\n\n![Alt Text](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/1/137fa14e33c6b60152c5c4700e5f77bb82b719f1.gif)\n\n### How does this benefit NounsDAO?\n- **The Episode** — Exposure for NounsDAO in a novel, powerful narrative – with analytics & insights (average results per episode: 2.7M impressions, 321K views, 12K watch-time hours)\n- **The Toolkit** — 3D tools that enables Nouns creators, creations, remixes with other IPs, and continued proliferation of Nouns to a new degree.\n- **Our Vision** — Inspire creators with the episode, enable creations with the toolkit, and catalyze a cohort of Nouns as VTubers and next-generation virtual avatars.\n\n### Community \nWorking directly with the Nouns community is key for this project in several ways:\n1. **Help choose what Nouns derivatives to feature** such as LilNouns, SharkDAO, skateboards from GnarsDAO, and art pieces from prop house. We love the extended Nouns community want to infuse this thriving ecosystem into the Toolkit and Episode.\n2. **Help define the 3D style of the Nouns characters and environments**, as well as how Nouns express themselves using motion capture and animation.\n3. **Help choose Nouns characters to be featured in the episode.** Some Nouns will be chosen for story purposes but we’d love the community to vote on what other Nouns get featured. Those Nouns holders will have the option to voice & motion capture their own Noun (assuming there’s dialogue).\n\n### The General Timeline\n* Phase 1: **Concept & Design + Episode Writing.** starts immediately (est 2 months)\n* Phase 2: **Asset creation.** Starts as concepts complete (est 2-3 months) Will overlap with Phase 1\n* Phase 3: **Launch Beta Repository.** Nov 2022 Assets are made available as they are created.\n* Phase 4: **Episode Production Starts** Jan 2023 *When assets are finished (est 3 months)\nEst Episode completion March 2023\n\n### Toolkit Repository Timeline\n* Phase 1: **Launch Beta Repository.** Nov 2022 Post assets as they become available\n* Phase 2: **Create Beta How to Docs & Tutorials.** (these will roll out starting in Dec thru March)\n* Phase 3: **Launch final Toolkit Repository.** March 2023\nWe will be sharing fun BTS & asset creation along the way via YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram content.\n\n### Our Ask & Budget Breakdown \nWe are asking for a total of $307.2K USD (192E @ $1600)\n* Toolkit Concept Art & Design — $20,480 (12.8ETH)\n* Toolkit 3D Modeling & Texturing — $99,040 (61.9ETH)\n* Nouns Character Modeling & Rigging — $33,440 (20.9ETH)\n* Toolkit Assembly & Episode Production — $141,280 (88.3ETH)\n* Toolkit publishing & maintenance — $12,960 (8.1ETH)\n\nThe proposed budget + 15% to cover volatility will be converted to USDC immediately, and everything in excess will be retrurned to the DAO. If, due to high volatility, there is insufficient ETH to cover the proposed budget (307.2K USD), a second proposal will be made.\n* Total: 192ETH * 1.15 = 220.8ETH\n\n---\n\n## Extra Details\n\n### The Nouns World Toolkit Repository \nThe CCO repository will consist of the cast of Nouns characters and environments made for the episode. Everything will be set up in the Unreal Engine (Free game engine software) and we're going to include all the scenes, cameras, lighting and animation from the episode which means, the Nouns City center will be alive with ambient animation and amazing cinematic lighting.  Additionally, the scenes from the episode will provide a starting point for making new content that looks amazing. All the Nouns characters will be rigged and ready for motion capture style animation (Both face and body similar to how Blu is setup in Xanadu).  For those with the right gear, this means you can instantly puppet any of those Nouns for V-Tubbing or creating your own cinematic content.  We're also exploring 'off the shelf' webcam mocap solutions (Cheap or free but body motion quality not as good as the expensive mocap suites) to include, if possible, to make inhabiting the nouns characters more accessible.  This would also allow using Nouns for Zoom calls, etc. \n\n### Nouns World Toolkit Details\n* 12 Hero Nouns (Face & Body fully rigged for motion capture)\n* 24 Secondary Nouns (Body fully rigged for motion capture. Minimal to no facial animation)\n* Beautifully lit and fully animated environments:\n* Nouns Downtown City Center (exterior, like Time Square)\n        * Buildings reflecting the Nouns extended family\n* Nouner Capitol Building (Exterior & Interior) \n* Nouns underground city / town (Exterior)\n* Noun masters Dojo (Exterior & Interior)\n* General modular city assets *for building new structures\n* General nounish props & furniture \n* Nouns transport vehicles\n* Wide Establishing model of the Nouns Planet\n* Guide Book & Tutorials on using the Toolkit to create Vtuber & Cinematic content \n\n### Technical Details\n* Unreal Engine 5 project - CC0\n* Assets performant in Real-time (Streaming)\n* Assets performant in VR\n* Fully animated Hero scenes from episode included as examples\n        * All hero Nouns characters ready for motion capture (Face and Body)\n\n### Production Team\n* Art Direction, Episode Writing & Directing\n* Producer\n* Lighting\n* Motion Capture\n* Animation\n* Cinematography\n* UE4 Integration & Tooling\n* VFX\n* Actors\n* Editing\n* Music\n* Sound Design\n\n### Episode Details\n* 20-30 minutes\n\n### About Xanadu & beyond\nThe heart of Xanadu is its zany stories and wild characters, but its soul burns to bridge and play in other universes. Thus Blu wants to help bring to life the budding spectrum of web3 Pop-Cultures from Nouns, cloneX and BAYC to small burgeoning Avatar projects backed by talented teams or individuals. All so they can collide on a bigger, more wild stage, with bigger, more wild crossover stories! Think Ready Player One and the Marvel Universe but creator content style!\n\n### FUN BONUS IDEA: Wild Story Twist!\nBlu’s adventure with the Nouns will live on beyond this episode in a ‘first-of-its-kind’ melding of entertainment & reality; After this episode airs, Blu’s fictional proposal (The one he formulates in the episode with help from the Nouns) is actually a real proposal that he submits to the Nouns DAO… and the outcome of that proposal dictates Blu’s future storyline – Will his proposal be good enough for approval, or will Blu have to evade the gangsters and find another solution to survive?\n\nIf you haven’t seen Xanadu yet, check it out [Xanadu on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/xanaduBlu) and our original proposal teaser.\n[![Image alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/xJTpIGK3tUc/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/xJTpIGK3tUc) \n\nThank you,\nCory & Stephen"},{"blockNumber":15455294,"blockHash":"0x76c121259a53605870bd2972a5ac20d6c125bd179afd142789e27e3112036ee1","transactionIndex":22,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xe9ae9f606e20aab6b0126972fe3e4f77f66019f460642c4095202f204a3c4e7c","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":136,"proposer":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","targets":["0xB293c23Ed9A0241Da1DE4AAB649246652346BdD6"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15468434,"endBlock":15488144,"description":"# Founding Partners of NFT Seattle\n\n(*TLDR, NFT Seattle is the first large scale Web3 event in the entire Pacific Northwest. We think it would be pretty sweet if the Nouns came in as title sponsors of this inaugural event*)\n\n### **DESCRIPTION**\n\n- Becoming the Nounding Partners / Presenting Sponsors of NFT Seattle creates an opportunity for the Nouns to build relationships with the Pacific Northwest’s Web3 community and solidify the Noun meme in the foundation of these new relationships.\n- As we establish Seattle as a hub for Web3 innovation, we'd love for the Nouns to come in at the ground level and cement the meme as an integral part of Seattle’s Web3 ecosystem, positioned for maximum and lasting brand exposure. The Web3 community is still growing in Seattle so the probability of reaching new people (vs people that already know about the Nouns) is likely higher here, than most other major US cities. Plus Seattle's technically inclined demographic lends itself well to everything the Nouns stand for, though people here are still warming up to the whole idea of NFT's.\n\n### **WHAT IS NFT SEATTLE**\n\n- NFT Seattle is the first event catering to the broader Web3 community in the Pacific Northwest (Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, BC).\n- The vision behind NFT Seattle is to establish Seattle as a hub for Web3 innovation & connect the growing community in the Northwest. We want to unite people in Seattle to educate & expose them to the opportunities & possibilities that Web3 brings to creators, businesses, artists, and communities.\n- This event is mainly targeting the Web3 curious and as such, has a heavier leaning towards education.\n- NFT Seattle will take place from 9/30/2022 - 10/1/2022 in Seattle at several venues including Block 41 and the Seattle NFT Museum (the worlds first NFT Museum).\n\n### **WHY SHOULD NOUNS BE INVOLVED & WHY IT MATTERS?**\n\n- NFT Seattle presents a unique opportunity for the Nouns to proliferate the Nouns meme and imagery (think, Noggles in downtown Seattle) across a region that is still trying to figure out Web3 but is on the cusp of a major Web3 breakout. A region that has already cemented itself as a global hub for technological and cultural innovation, with everything from Amazon/Microsoft to Starbucks and many more having been birthed here.\n- As the first Web3 event in the Pacific Northwest, NFT Seattle will draw people in from Portland, Seattle, Vancouver BC and will lean heavily towards education plus fostering deep, meaningful connection between brands, thought leaders and other attendees. Early data suggests the audience will be a healthy mix between the Web3 curious, and those that are pioneering in the space.\n- This event also creates a perfect opportunity for an IRL Noun meetup, for Nouns that are local to the region to come and engage with the local community while providing *Nouns on the Ground* an opportunity to execute their existing IRL events strategy, in a new untapped market. Also, hoping to partner with the Nounish marketing team to up-level the Nounishness of this activation if the prop passes. (Initial conversations have been started).\n\n### **THE BREAKDOWN**\n\n- **Presenting Title Sponsor of NFT Seattle** (”NFT Seattle presented by the Nouns”). Nouns branding will be prominently featured at the Event and the official After Party.\n    \n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/jDWDkc8.png)\n\n\n    \n- **Live Art Premier** that is nouns-inspired and incorporates the noggles, showcased by local high profile NFT artist [Jaiden ‘Jasti’ Stipp](https://www.instagram.com/jastidesigns/), the 16yr old that made over a million selling NFT's.\n- As a way of thanking the Nouns for being a founding event partner for NFT Seattle, this commemorative art-piece will become a permanent fixture at every NFT Seattle annual event, an exclusive benefit only being extended to the Nouns. We’ll store this piece for future use, or the Nouns can opt to claim it for use at other IRL events.\n- **Evergreen Video Content** to drive meme awareness and exposure: 2 daily sizzle Reels to be shared upon completion of each event day specifically highlighting the Nouns, and 1 sizzle Reel showcasing the creation of the custom mural. Video content to be produced by local media partner Brandtegic.\n- **Nouns Branding exclusively featured on each String Backpack** provided to all attendees upon entry. Nouns stickers and swag will also be included in each swag bag (we'd need help designing the stickers).\n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/poa1pxT.jpg)\n\n\n    \n- **Nouns Branding prominently featured on Social, Website, and Emails** that will be widely visible to all attendees, the public, and reviewed by various news outlets and media partners. We just recently kicked off a regional PR campaign, the Nouns imagery will be added to the the forefront of all marketing materials associated with the event as a title sponsor.\n\n- **Fireside chat with a Noun**, an optional speaking opportunity where a designated Noun can share a bit about how the Nouns continue to play a key role in the advancement of the overall DAO ecosystem via the prop house model or a deep dive into cc0 NFT's, using Nouns as a use-case.\n\n\n### **THE ASK**\n\nThis is a title sponsorship for NFT Seattle, and cost breakdown will be as follows:\n\n- $65,000 USD ~ 40 ETH (calculated at 1 ETH = $1,600)\n    - 10 ETH - Towards venue costs + event production team (labor)\n    - 16 ETH - Towards A/V production + other venue related expenses\n    - 10 ETH - Towards PR campaign, advertising, event marketing, videographers and video editing. (This includes printing graphics for all Nouns signage and marketing materials)\n    - 4 ETH - Live painted Nouns inspired mural/art piece by Jasti (reusable at future events)\n    \n    ***N.B.** This cost also factors in event admission for Nouns that wish to attend (up until a pre-negotiated number) as well as an optional booth activation, if there are nouns on the ground available to man it.*\n    \n\n### **WHY SEATTLE**\n\n- Seattle is an emerging market in Web3 with events just starting to take place. (ETHSeattle, blockchain events, and now NFT Seattle)\n- Starbucks is entering Web3 and launching an NFT collection ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/04/starbucks-teases-web-3-platform-in-nft-announcement/)) and it’s in good company among other major brands with a substantial presence in Washington who are either ALL-IN or dabbling in Web3- Salesforce, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple.\n- Besides SF, Seattle has more tech talent than any other city in the country ([425 Business](https://www.425business.com/news/greater-seattle-no-2-in-tech-talent-report/article_37815015-8e5d-58f2-81fa-593715c7f695.html)) and it’s also the country’s most desired location for people aged 18 to 24 ([Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/cost-of-living/seattle-wa/)), making the city an ideal place for Web3 brands to establish a presence in order to attract and retain top talent.\n- 75% or more of PNW Angel Investors are interested in Web3 companies and founders.

We seek to impact various causes by addressing problems that affect our society. Mucho Love aims to cultivate a community in which all members feel part of something bigger than themselves, making them feel nounish.\n\n### How does Mucho Love work?\n\nMucho Love was created by 5 founders, who wear many hats and structured what it is today. We plan to expand the team next year to escalate further and establish more specific scopes. Currently, we have over 30 community members eager to volunteer for the causes we are aiding.\n\nMucho Love currently works on a 9-step system.\n\n1. **Ideation:** planning and deciding on activities.\n2. **Outreach:** contacting the organizations/places, writing letters/petitions, and setting up dates/places.\n3. **Chronogram/Requirements:** Itinerary, step-by-step program to be performed on events, pre-event checklist, proofreading.\n4. **Quotations:** quotation of each item or service (3 quotations from different companies per item or service)\n5. **Payments and Negotiations:** negotiating with businesses, establishing formal relationships, explaining MUCHO LOVE, and paying for services/items.\n6. **Pre-Event:** revision of the pre-event checklist, volunteer count, and Zoom meetings with volunteers and multimedia team to prepare for the event.\n7. **Event Day:** role call, transportation to the event, itinerary execution, feedback.\n8. **Post Event:** post-event multimedia management and feedback from participants.\n9. **Documentation:** establishing the framework to replicate the current working system by documenting for the continuous improvement of the project.\n\n### How does this benefit the DAO?\n\n**Charity** is a recurrent activity/topic within the Nounish ecosystem—that’s why we decided to start a nounish volunteering community that makes sure to proliferate Nouns with the values and vision it represents. **Mucho Love aims to become one of the Nounish platforms regarding community service, social work, and volunteering campaigns.** Mucho Love’s activities will all be shared through Twitter and Instagram, appealing to the masses and expanding global Noggle adoption.\n\nMucho Love is starting operations in the Dominican Republic but aims to develop a model that is replicable internationally. Also, if needed, we want to be able to travel to any part of the world to aid any team who needs help developing charitable efforts in their respective communities. \n\n### Goals\n\nOur goal is to **establish the foundation of Mucho Love as a future Decentralized Non-Profit Organization** **that will allow us to replicate the model in any part of the world.** The structure/model created will be available for any team that wants to make charitable efforts in their respective communities. We also want to keep collaborating with established Nounish projects (like BigShotKlim’s pins and Messhup’s books) that can contribute with donations to proliferate Nouns further.\n\nMucho Love will carry out during the 4-month extension events/donations/activities among the following:\n\n* Hospital Robert Ried\n* Hospital Hugo Mendoza\n* Red Misericordia (Orphanage)\n* Hogar Escuela Santo Domingo Savio (Orphanage/School)\n* Escuelita Café con Leche (Orphanage/School)\n\n*2 institutions have not given a definitive yes; therefore, they are subject to change.\n\n### Pilot results\n\nThe pilot successfully helped children feel joy despite going through difficult moments. We also showed what the Noggles are and what they can do. People fell in love with Messhup’s books and BigShotKlim’s Noggle pins. Children that used glasses felt even more identified with the Noggles. I can genuinely say that the pilot was a success; the Noggles were well received, and we helped out 300 children and their parents while proliferating Nouns, love, and optimism.\n\n300 Children received 300 Nounish goodie bags containing:\n\n* Messhup’s coloring book (300 total)\n* Crayola box (300 total)\n* Diapers (1440 total)\n* Stickers (600 total)\n* BigShotKlim’s Noggle Pins (100 total)\n\nVideo recap:\n\n\n#### [MUCHO LOVE ](https://twitter.com/mucholovedr/status/1565689757740535808)\n\n[@mucholovedr](https://twitter.com/mucholovedr/status/1565689757740535808)\n\nSpreading ❤️ with ⌐◧-◧ *⌐◧-◧ are used to protect children’s identity https://t.co/PWvO4nhZYA\n\n### Budget\n\n24 ETH to be distributed in the following way:\n\n* 19 ETH for donations\n* 3 ETH for photo/video crew\n* 1 ETH for t-shirts and hats for volunteers to use during the events\n* 1 ETH for a storage facility\n\n*The team has not received any compensation, nor is it interested in getting compensation until we go on-chain again by the end of the year.\n\n*If any Nounish Project creator wants to collaborate with their products/ideas feel free to reach out to me.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FGPF9af.jpg)\n\n"},{"blockNumber":15491791,"blockHash":"0x9a41ddbdbe01344d02d3907d55448caa53f61b8d474d72f36e3e3ef1ed1721fe","transactionIndex":188,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xf49ddb019aa5e7294ef414b6aa3c05fd721be4e5f168ddb3fa2501a0a028b31d","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":138,"proposer":"0x96c80ab80A920efD32485Bc2FB9DFeC601F357e6","targets":["0x96c80ab80A920efD32485Bc2FB9DFeC601F357e6"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15504931,"endBlock":15524641,"description":"# Nouns X Internet Game: Season 2 w/ gmoney\n\n**Dear NounsDAO,**\n\nI’m a *huge* fans of Nouns. A big part of my Solidity education was forking the Nouns contract back when we were at Noun #3. So I’m super thrilled to present an idea that integrates Nouns into what I've been working on for 2 years, & can contribute to the Nounish goal of spreading the Nouns meme far & wide.\n\n----\n\n**TLDR:** We are Internet Game. We host massive web3 game shows with thousands of players and blue-chip NFT prizes. Our Season 2 is coming up next, hosted by gmoney, and we’d like to re-skin one of the games to feature Nouns, as well as educate our players about Nouns with a video prior to the game.\n\nBefore we get into specifics, we’ll share a bit more about who we are and why we’re qualified to propose this…\n\n## What is Internet Game??\n\n[Internet Game](https://internet.game/) is Squid Game meets NFTs. We create live, interactive game shows that anyone can play at home with hyper-simple, yet dangerously fun mini-games. 60% of buy-ins go to blue-chip NFT prizes, all voted on by the community in Discord.\n\nIn March 2022 we launched our Internet Game: [Season 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ut4uEdKyydQ3lFZFoGIMUWpsqXQh_ZE3NugP6UGIE-c/edit#slide=id.g13ad4d9e874_0_0). 8000 players minted $2.2M in NFTs to play. We then purchased $1M+ in NFT prizes as voted on by the players, including Bored Apes, Mutant Apes, Doodles, Azukis, CloneX and many more.\n\nThe best way to fully understand how our seasons work is to[ look at this case study](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ut4uEdKyydQ3lFZFoGIMUWpsqXQh_ZE3NugP6UGIE-c/edit#slide=id.p).\n\nInternet Game: Season 2 “Bear Market Battle” launches on September 12th. Season 2 features 6 brand new games taking place between September 12th and 23rd. The entire event is hosted by the infamous gmoney & comedian Leah Lamarr. Gmoney will appear as a full 3D version of his cryptopunk by being rigged up in a high-fidelity motion capture suit, and will then be superimposed on an XR stage (picture a gigantic LED screen & floor) next to Leah.\n\n## Season 2 Trailer:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lr3GruECkk\n\nHere’s a preview of what that looks like from the podcast we did with gmoney on the XR stage with him in the co-cap suit:\n\n![|624x323](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/R2_yJv7VgaZlSyENj-pB3qwG82IdRuM9S1i94XuvPAeTjmR2gD5Hnqiz-vE7NWVMMAFtEY4ZTSFat4h1jg9DTlxnubOXHtnfWIhRnJIAmcmypoVrmrmuGvGc5RIU2Hw-z3xxbllb31NhvAAY-eXIk8w)\n\n## The Opportunity: Nouns Game + Video in Season 2\n\nInternet Game Season 2 is made up of 6 mini-games that take place over the course of two weeks. Each game runs for 24 hours.\n\nThere is an opportunity to fully brand the third game, currently titled as “The Last Spaceship”, and transform it into “The Last Noun”.\n\nThe game itself is similar to an old school Asteroids / Galaga space shooter, but with an original take on how you move around the space. We think the 2D arcade aesthetic is a perfect match for the Nouns art. Both the main character as well as the enemies would be Nouns:\n\n## The Opportunity: Nouns Game + Video in Season 2\n\nInternet Game Season 2 is made up of 6 mini-games that take place over the course of two weeks.

If desired, we could include a trailer / explainer / hype video for Nouns in that video. This would need to be provided by Nouns DAO.\n\n**Additional opportunities during Season 2:**\n\n* Including Nouns and/or Lil Nouns in our prize pool\n* Skinning the entire Internet Game tournament page during “The Last Noun” game to be Nouns-branded\n* Upon the launch of the game, post a write up on our social platforms (Twitter/Discord) to educate our audience on Nouns DAO and the Nouns mission & mechanics\n\n## Our Ask:\n\n**ETH Sponsorship:** Nouns DAO would contribute 20 ETH to Internet Game Season 2. The sponsorship would be split to further contribute to the prize pool and cover operational expenditures incurred by Internet Game.\n\n## Proposed Timeline & Next Steps\n\n* Engage in discussions to answer any questions derived from this proposal\n* Gain approval to transform “The Last Spaceship” into “The Last Noun”\n* Announce partnership with Nouns DAO for Season 2 including the donation to the prize pool\n* Complete redesign of the tournament page and game and showcase to Nouns DAO for feedback\n* Launch “The Last Noun” Game on September 16th, along with the optional pre-game video\n\n## Long-Term Opportunity: Nouns Custom Casual Game\n\nWe we would love to continue the relationship and build a fully custom game for Nouns that can live on in perpetuity. The game would be co-created by the DAO and Internet Game to provide a unique experience that allows consumers to connect with the Nouns brand in an interactive way. Casual gaming is a juggernaut of an industry due to its accessibility (ease of learning), low effort requirement, and repeat value (easy to hop in and out of) it provides. We see a Nouns Game as a way to engage the general population in a highly scalable and interactive way all around the world. Details on this longer-term partnership opportunity can be submitted through a separate proposal.\n\n---\n\n*Thank you for reading! We'll be excitedly watching the voting.*"},{"blockNumber":15493528,"blockHash":"0x92123063e23cefa2571689acaa6d873e68f3b859a801482971c3c576814bdb60","transactionIndex":231,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x026ca1107cddf565d3e00c3adc3e85bfca764fd8a5cc9a9be368f94f5aaa2dd7","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":139,"proposer":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","targets":["0xE8cF782Bb4aCB9000fae76bA940295CA988DE7Be"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15506668,"endBlock":15526378,"description":"# Noun Sounds Proposal\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/AqMhNe3.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/746662212\n)\n\nWATCH VIDEO: https://vimeo.com/746662212\n\n## **TL;DR** \n\nNoun Sounds will provide a much needed audio-scape to the Nouns ecosystem.  SuperTightWoody and Papaya will create a platform and ingest processes where anyone can create, export and contribute CC0 Nounish songs, stems, samples, sounds effects and more.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/96a5gtJ.png)\n\n# The Problem\n\nThere is currently no Nouns audio aesthetic, and no environment for it to flourish. There are no sonic logos, sounds or songs that have a consistent use case in the Nouns world. Nounish creators of apps, videos, games and beyond have nowhere to turn for audio. \n\nNounish creators have to source their own audio, often out of their own pocket while being forced to manage limited use rights.\n\nAll of this makes brand consistency/recognition difficult and next to impossible. Sonic logos, sounds or songs are a core part of any brand.  \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VN0FNJY.png)\n\n\n# Our Solution\n\n**nounsounds.wtf**\n\nWe will create a robust website that will act as a hub for all things related to Nouns audio. This will include an easy to use music “PLAYground” to build a unique Nouns song for your project, a repository of samples/sounds/songs and a robust roadmap with processes and structure, allowing our environment to grow.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UevPiIZ.png)\n\n---\n\n# The User Experience\n\n## **Homepage**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Z53wdaT.png)\n\nOn the homepage, the latest Noun Sound will be displayed along with the Noun it generates!  **This, and all Noun Sounds, will be available for free use and CC0**.\n\n How does it generate this Noun Sound you might ask?  Let’s head over to the…\n\n## **PLAYground**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pwDMdY5.png)\n\nThe visual Noun will be generated via the PLAYground tab.  \n\nIn this area, a song is split into its different tracks. Here, one of the 10 songs created for Nouns will be selected.  Each song will contain 5 variations per instrument. Each instrument will correspond to a Nouns layer whose assets will be randomly generated when the page loads. \n\nRefreshing the page or hitting the “Randomize” button will randomly select a new SONG and new set of LAYERS.  Every time you create a new Nouns Sound, a unique new Noun will be born to accompany it!\n\nPut together your favorite song tracks for your project and…VOILA!  You now have your own unique Noun Sound.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/kAFMtLi.png)\n](https://vimeo.com/738442849/e3cdaf3d87)\nWATCH VIDEO: https://vimeo.com/738442849/e3cdaf3d87\n\n## **Sounds**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9DU37V1.png)\n\nIf you want to grab any of the full songs, stems, loops, samples or sound effects by themselves- this is the place to go.  Easily filter these via metadata and get to creating your Nounish multimedia! \n\n# How Does This Proliferate Nouns?\n\n***Sound*** is the backbone of any cohesive brand and multimedia creation.  This CC0 resource will assist in the production of music, apps, games, videos, social content, sonic branding and more- all revolving around Nouns.  As we work along side Nouns DAO in the future, a self sustaining library of high quality audio will fill a void for creators across all mediums of creative content. \n\n# The Team\n\nWith 20+ years of music production and engineering experience, **SuperTightWoody** is a Grammy Nominated music producer.  Having works featured on major label albums, TV shows, movie trailers and television commercials.  In the Nouns space, he has created the theme song for the Nouncil along with theme songs for The Noun Square Twitter spaces (and the “soundboard” for TNS).  As a Nouncil and TNS member- he is very much looking forward to expanding his contributions into the Nouns space.\n\n**Papaya** is a software engineer with 15+ years of experience known for his attention to detail. He has worked on numerous NFT Collections, tools and Defi protocols. He loves building unique experiences for web3 communities and developers. \n\n# Timeline\n\nThe creation of everything laid out in this first proposal will take 3 months to complete from proposal approval.\n\n# Proposed Funding\n\n72ETH for deliverables + timeline. \n*Signers will be SuperTightWoody and Papaya for multisig wallet 0xE8cF782Bb4aCB9000fae76bA940295CA988DE7Be*\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables\n\n**This Proposal: First Audio Library + Infrastructure**  \n\nOur first proposal is to create the first Nounish audio library, a website, an easy-to-use tool for builders to create songs, and laying out the workflows for onboarding new music makers into the system processes.\n\n- *A fully functional Noun Sounds website with user friendly audio interfaces*\n- *10 CC0 Noun Sounds songs (+ 5 variations of each instrument for the PLAYground)*\n- *3 Nouns sonic logo stings*\n- *20 bleeps, bloops, swooshes and more for apps and games*\n- *All songs, stems and individual samples page available for download*\n- *Twitter account and Discord for building the Noun Sounds community*\n\n---\n\n**Next Proposal: New Tools + Bring on other musicians**\n\nOnce this infrastructure has been built and our ingestion flow for new audio is set, it’s time to grow independently.\n\n- *Create Noun Sounds DAO*\n- *Start developing system to Fund DAO through the sales of generated Noun Sounds NFTs.*\n- *Create pipeline for onboarding new musicians via sounds submissions + legal processes*\n- *Create professional VST instruments that music makers can use in the DAW of their choice, to create an audio palette that allows total freedom while keeping brand cohesion*\n- *Explore the use of AI and other technologies to push the envelope of what is possible*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/etJbiGT.png)\n\n## Additional Links:\n\nwww.supertight.co\n\nwww.soundcloud.com/supertightwoody\n\nwww.soundcloud.com/nounspoap\n\n## Proposed Transactions:\n\n1. 0xE8cF782Bb4aCB9000fae76bA940295CA988DE7Be.transfer(\n 72 ETH\n)\n"},{"blockNumber":15522832,"blockHash":"0x999379341eb3cb7e332e5aafe36a0f53ac5af593b06e827082b874da4020c21e","transactionIndex":208,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x314ce8abcac3147b44e7f1d4fd5238cb15310ae502409207b03fb6fe09172844","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":140,"proposer":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","targets":["0x58a25b8C593C75F6bcEb2C805a53437DA3C53757"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15535972,"endBlock":15555682,"description":"# Pilot: Crowdsourced Prop House\n\n### tl;dr:\n\nRequesting 40 ETH to pilot using Prop House as a self-curation tool.\n\n### Preliminary Round:\n\nThe preliminary round will be used to source ideas for prop house topics from the community.

We have communicated updates weekly on the [Discord here](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/973957832015761428) and have had many conversations on [Discourse here](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nounish-friends-nouns-town-collectible-figures-and-more-by-bigshottoyworks/967/42?page=3&fbclid=IwAR2b6AnS2-xKAbn0eja5dL0k1LCufZM4v_nT5NbJXzZ_ZWWb5FEo_PIxly8), gathering feedback from over 50 comments to arrive at the final designs we’re proposing today. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mJ5emSS.jpg)\n\n___\n**II. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT COSTS:**\n___\n**CURRENT STAGE:**\n - **Engineering:**  tooling masters, paint masks, production molds, Packaging, Final branding, box and display box design and dies: $45K ***(one time cost)***\n - **Manufacturing:** $53K for 10K pcs \n - **Logistics/warehousing:** $29K\n - **Marketing, project management & B2B & B2C sales:** $40K for 6 months. This involves sample photography,press, targeted social media engagement, onboarding  and follow ups, potential partner onboarding and communications. This includes unexpected sample creations and air shipping for events such as Art Basel, Dcon, NFTNYC and other opportunities world wide while the mass production run is being produced.\n - **TOTAL ASK:** $167K USD\n\n**PAYMENT SCHEDULE:**\nPayments to be broken down into 3 milestones as follows: \n - **35% upfront** ($58,450 USD)\nPreproduction deposit for further final development of graphics, packaging templates, tooling molds, paint molds, and final samples.\n - **35% on Milestone 1** ($58,450 USD)\nDeposit for mass production deposit once tooling test shots and painted counter sample approvals,\n - **30% on Milestone 2** (50,100 USD)\nFull balance paid out once production passes testing. QC inspection and is ready to ship to our warehouse by sea.\n\n**PAYMENT DETAILS**\n - **GNOSIS SAFE**\nETH will be sent to a 2/3 Gnosis Safe with the following signers:\nBigshot Klim - 0xd25912007EBC2527d4ED9DC536f928E550b0f02C\nJoshua Fisher - JoshuaFisher.eth\nJoel Cares - JoelCares.eth\n\n - **ETH -> USD CONVERSION**\nCalculations done on 9/14/2022 at $1,600 USD / ETH\nProject Cost = $167,000 USD = 104.38 ETH\nVolatility Buffer (10%) = 10.44 ETH\nTOTAL ASK = 114.82 ETH \n\n - **PROCEDURE**\n   - A 10% buffer was added to the ask to account for volatility in ETH prices prior to conversion.\n   - Upon recieving the funds Gnosis Safe operators will immediately convert ETH to USDC to cover total Project Cost. The USDC will be held in the safe and released to Bigshot Klim when Milestones are completed.\n   - If for any reason there are excess funds (ETH remaining  after conversion, milestones not hit) any unspent funds will be returned to Nouns DAO.\n   - If the value of ETH falls sufficiently before conversion and this value no longer covers project costs another proposal will be submitted to cover the difference. \n\n - **TRANSACTION**\ntransfer 114.82 ETH to 0xA04D191Ae755c442B5e4a0ea10136b7B0354cC6a\n\n___\n**III. FUTURE STEPS**\n___\n\nOur 10,000 physical toys will be utilized for both sales and giveaways for maximum reach and value. We believe that both are important aspect of this proof of concept model moving forward:\n\n - 10% -1,000 toys(100 sets) allocated to community members and other Nouns initiatives like Nouns OTG, Rose Bowl and Art Basel Miami etc. Final production Toys will be allocated and shipped from our warehouse (worldwide approx shipping/handling cost $35 per case of toys) \n - 9,000 units to be sold at SRP $14/toy, or approx $7 wholesale + shipping. Portion of the sales will be used to develop series 2 and put forth in a proposal if the project is a success. \n - Option for DAO allocated additional quantities from this edition at $7/unit \n - Option to re-order at lower unit cost ($5-6/unit) in a future run.\n - Option to create unique colorways & revised single-unit packaging at lower unit cost.\n - A collectible card with a POAP is included with each toy. Use TBD, but it will help with future engagement and retain customer attention.Collectors and fans could receive digital goodies, participate in games, contests or win prizes from our NOUNWORKS shop, and/or have access to unique experiences for POAP holders only. Goodies and prizes can be things in our shops or future items from the community based on the promotions and future partnerships and collaborations(TBD) based on Nounish partners and collaborations.\n\nIt is imperative that we expedite manufacturing so that we can have product ready for public introduction and review at Designercon in November 18-20 2022 (10X20 Booth booked), Art Basel in Miami in December, and possible availability for distribution at Rose Bowl (Jan 1, 2023) with Stoopid Buddy Studios. We can support global meet ups with products as well as some blank figures for local artists to paint.\n\n\n\nAll of the items ship from a central location in USA so the marketing and proliferation logistics are perfectly aligned.

The instructor explains what are “the secret crypto words”, how they can “control magic internet money”, and how anyone - even kids - can earn, use or store such money.\\n\\n**b) NFTs:** the instructor shows attendees how digital wallets can hold other digital stuff. A series of these valuable things have been scattered through the Skate Cuida Institute (QR codes linking to a minting page). A treasure hunt leads attendees to earn their first NFTs.\\n\\n**c) DAO:** the instructor shows a site where they can use their NFTs as tickets to join a club. He tells them there is a proposal there where they can vote for a prize that will be distributed either to half the “club”… or to all of its members - depending on how they vote it. The instructor reveals the results (awarding a prize in crypto to every participant) and teaches basic concepts in cooperation and game theory. He tells the audience the workshop was sponsored by a “club”, too - NounsDAO - that collaborates online to do cool stuff in the real world. And incites attendees they can do the same via the club they now belong to.\\n\\n**d) Skate & Lunch:** to wrap things up, Bob Burnquist invites the kids for a ride on the Institute’s track, then **food and drinks** are served for all.\\n\\nWe plan to bring 30 kids in each workshop.

Most of the amazing projects that Nouns funds need help telling their story, and video is the best way to do so.\n\nIt is safe to assume that without the videos we published, Nouns DAO would have missed the opportunity of amplifying the stories of these wonderful projects. \n\nWith video, we are able to tell a much deeper and colorful story and evoke much more emotion. We believe this must be 10Xed to recruit more builders to help the meme proliferate. \n\n## The Nouns Funnel\n\nWe think of builder & community onboarding as a funnel: \n\n\n\n* **Top of Funnel**: People who heear about Nouns from a friend, stumble upon a Nouns project in their city, enjoy a piece of nouns art on twitter etc. \n* **Middle of Funnel**: People who become curious to understand what Nouns are, want to learn how to get funded, or want to join the community.\n* **Bottom of Funnel**: People who are ready to submit a proposal, buy a noun (or nounlet), or to join the community or a sub DAO.\n\n\nIn the next 6 months we want to focus on the **Middle of the Funnel**. We want to help explain what Nouns are to the world and get many more people noun-pilled. \n\n**Why focus on Middle of Funnel first and not Top of Funnel?**\n\nThe majority of people that have heard of Nouns do not really grok what it is, never-mind all the potential builders outside the NFT bubble that we are missing out on because it’s too esoteric to dive in to. In reality, almost no one gets what we’re doing, and it’s impossible for them to have a vision for Nouns.\n\nThe hurdle to understand what Nouns is and how to interact with the community is absurdly high for someone not native to our ecosystem.\n\nIt’s imperative that there’s quality consumable content out there that helps people **not only understand what Nouns is doing but be inspired to join in**. What we need is social media channels (eg. YouTube and Instagram) that have a significant catalogue of content you can just sit and consume. \n\n* We are going to try to answer questions that are not easily answered today like:\n\t* **“So what does nouns actually do and stand for?\"**\n\t\t* This is a branding exercise, this is key for our work to answer.\n\t* **“What is Nouns actually to me?”**\n\t\t* The answer is not NFTs, or a DAO (that is just infrastructure), it's an open source brand that you can be funded to build on (or build on permissionlessly). It’s an energised and broad community. It’s a movement. We need to demonstrate this through our videos.\n\t* **“What’s a nounish concept / proposal?”**\n\t\t* Current way to understand this: read hundreds of proposals on nouns.wtf/vote, tally their results, investigate if they were “successful” or not, if the dao likes them, analyse all this data… etc. What if instead they could watch a handful of nounish videos that show the things we’re proud of?\n\t* **“How do I get funded?”**\n\t\t* Videos about this will be hugely valuable, currently it takes a lot of effort to understand this. Our top priority here is to make a few videos focused exclusively on getting funded via Prop House and then other videos about the other ways as a whole, and individual videos on specifics (on chain, nsfw etc.)\n\t* **“Can it be any cultural domain?”**\n\t\t* Here are some screenshots from version 1 of our intro. We will continue to experiment and iterate with ways to tell this story all the time. This is hugely important to be understood if we want to experiment in every vertical.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xeVv9Yh.jpg)\n\n## What we will deliver as part of this prop\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VfTyQw4.gif)\n\n\n### Nounish across all social networks\n\nWe will spend the next 6 months churning out high quality video content about Nouns and its builders. \n\nWe plan to work on all major Social Media networks. We have started building a following on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nounish) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thats_nounish/).

Instead, the Noundry evolved into a collaborative experience — a festival — where artists from around the world came together to inspire and build upon each other's ideas, using Nouns pixel art as a canvas to unite around.\n\nThe artwork we eventually added to the Nouns Descriptor contract resulted from a group effort and would not have been the same without the participation of the larger community.\n\nWith this proposal, we want to acknowledge that the collaborative, explorative side of the Noundry is as vital as the outcome and hope to set an example for upcoming Noundrys.\n\n## Compensation\n\n### Community compensation\n\nWe think community compensation is best left to the community to decide.

Total ask of 142.69 eth.**\n\nWe believe that Noundry compensation is more than a box-ticking exercise. Pixel art is part of who we are; it's in our bones, and adding new pixels to the Descriptor contract is a big deal. It's an opportunity to celebrate nounishness, reinforce our culture, and create new traditions.\n\nWe want the Noundry to become a continuous event, a new tradition, and a significant driver of Nouns proliferation within artistic circles. In that light, the compensation outlined in this proposal is not just about the work that was completed, but also about future signaling.\n\nWe think one of the most exciting possible outcomes of the Noundry would be if every artist in the world aspires to put their artwork into the Nouns contract (and by extension, the public domain). And while high compensation may not be the primary motivator, it can help initiate the right feedback loop and create the breeding ground needed for future Noundrys to thrive.\n\n## Compensation\n\n### Winner compensation\n*[https://nouns.wtf/vote/125](https://nouns.wtf/vote/125) (Integrate 8/8 Anniversary Art)*\n\nNoundry Season 0 winners are compensated per winning trait.

They are compensated for organizing the event, curating, and fine-tuning the winning contributions. \n\nIt's hard to put a figure value on the committee's efforts — in many ways it's priceless.

In V2, quorum has a dynamic range, rising as a function of against votes up to a defined cap. Read [this post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE) for more info.\n2. **Vote with Gas Refund**: Allow Nouners/delegates to vote and receive a gas refund. The vote still takes place in the case of insufficient ETH to refund.\n3. **Voting Delay Editing Bug Fix**: In V1, editing voting delay was unsafe. V2 makes it safe to edit anytime. More info on the bug [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-diligence/blob/main/reports/proposal-58.md#major).\n4. **Cancel Proposal Bug Fix**: The DAO has a spam mitigation feature, allowing anyone to cancel a proposal if the proposer has an amount of votes less than or equal to proposal threshold. In V1, this feature didn't work when proposer had exactly proposal threshold votes; in V2 it works as expected.\n5. **Vetoer Change Is Now 2-step**: We received audit feedback that V1's vetoer change process was risky as a single-step process. In V2, the risk of setting a wrong vetoer is mitigated using a 2-step process where the current vetoer sets a pending new vetoer. Once set, the pending vetoer must accept for the change to take place.\n\n## Audit\n\n1. The code has gone through internal reviews and a [code4rena audit](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-08-nounsdao/).\n2. **No high-risk issues were found in V2**.\n3. **Unrelated to this proposal**, one high-risk issue was found. See [this audit summary on discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-dao-v2-audit-summary/2525) for more information.\n\n\n## Dynamic Quorum Parameters\n\nAs articulated in this [detailed post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE), three parameters need to be set for dynamic quorum. This proposal sets their values, and we’re offering the thinking behind them here:\n\n1. **Minimum quorum %**: keeping it at 10%, the same as today’s quorum.\n2. **Maximum quorum %**: setting it to 15%, taking into account recent participation levels around 30%, allowing proposals with more than 15% For votes to be decided by simple majority; the intent is for this value to provide extra protection from voter apathy, while allowing most all proposals to be decided by simple majority rather than quorum.\n3. **Coefficient**: setting it to 1, such that each against vote raises the quorum requirement by one vote, until the maximum quorum is reached.\n\nThese parameters can be edited at any time via a proposal; treat these values as the first experiment.\n\n## Vote with Gas Refund\n\nA bit more on how this feature works:\n\n1. Governance clients (like nouns.wtf/vote) need to update their code to support it.\n2. Refunds are subject to certain constraints:\n    1. Gas base fee is capped at 200 gwei.\n    2. Gas priority fee is capped at 2 gwei.\n    3. Total gas is capped at 200K, supporting voting reason text up to roughly 9,190 characters.\n    4. If the contract’s balance is insufficient, voter will receive a partial refund.\n3. This feature requires the DAO to maintain the DAO contract’s ETH balance, which should be done via periodic ETH transfer proposals from the treasury to the DAO contract (this proposal performs the first funding).\n4. The DAO can choose to withdraw refund ETH back into the treasury at any time via a proposal.\n\n\n## Proposal Transactions for Humans\n\n1. `_setImplementation`: upgrades DAO logic to V2.\n2. `_setDynamicQuorumParams`: sets dynamic quorum params to:\n    1. Minimum quorum BPs: 10% (1000 basis points).\n    2. Maximum quorum BPs: 15% (1500 basis points).\n    3.

We've clarified our deliverables, increased transparency, reduced the ask by 20%, and implemented a payment stream*\n\n## TL;DR\nWe’d like to seek funding to keep developing [Agora](https://www.nounsagora.com/) in order to improve the governance efficacy of Nouns through delegation. Our goal is to significantly increase the participation rate of nouns through a combination of software improvements, and delegation drive programs over the next quarter.\n\n## Progress so far\nWe got [funded](https://prop.house/proposal/1023) on August 31 via Prop House mandates to build an MVP. In less than one month, we’ve built a delegate platform for voters to broadcast what they want to see, and for builders to find voters who might support their proposal. To illustrate the outcome with some numbers, so far we’ve seen:\n\n* 19 statements from delegates representing 127 nouns (>25% of all votes!)\n* 25 statements from builders who are seeking delegation\n* 5 nouns delegated via Agora (that we know of)\n* Hosted a delegate race to “auction” 3 more votes to delegates\n* Proposal passed to deploy on lil nouns, as well as inbound interest from many other DAOs\n\nIn sum, Agora has created a hub that turned delegation from an invisible, behind the scenes activity, to something the community can see, participate in, discuss, and improve upon.\n\n## Roadmap & Goals\nNow that we’ve landed an MVP of a delegate platform, it’s time to start leveraging it to meaningfully drive delegation & governance participation. We expect to complete these goals and achieve their resulting outcome in roughly one quarter. Note that all points here consist of our best plan of attack today, but as we continue to build Agora, we expect the roadmap to naturally evolve as we double down on what’s working, and deprioritize what’s not.\n\n**Goal 1: Dramatically reduce friction to delegation:**\n* Integrate with nouns.wtf to propose “post-win” delegate suggestions\n* Enable direct delegation on Agora (where today we borrow the nouns.wtf flow)\n* Enable time-bound, fractional, and supercedable delegation by a proxy contract to unblock funds & whales who are currently unwilling to delegate\n* Productize delegate race so that Nouners who don’t want to pick a delegate can let the community pick for them\n\n**Goal 2: Make governance and delegation more transparent and easy to understand**\n* Continue investing in surfacing more delegate and voting data on Agora\n* Build a governance activity feed that highlights delegation, ownership change, voting, and other governance related activities.\n* Make other general improvements to Agora to make it a first class experience for governance participants\n\n**Goal 3: Activate nouns holders to either vote or delegate**\n* Direct outreach to inactive Nouners from Agora team to find them a suitable delegate\n* Implement an inactive nouner bounty program, highlighting and incentivizing the community to reach out to inactive holders.\n* Run a marketplace experiment to allow anyone to rent votes from Nouns holders\n* Run a direct reward (in both ETH and NFT prizes) experiment to directly incentivize voting\n\n**Target objectives in 3 months:**\n* 75% of new nouns are delegated to voters who vote on more than 50% of props they're eligible to\n* 50% participation in a rolling average of past 3 proposals\n\n## Transparency & decentralization\nAs a governance platform, we will take measures to maintain transparency and avoid centralization of power by taking the following measures: \n* Make Github repo public within 1 month (with proper documentation to come over time)\n* Publish all data monthly to public google sheets, or equivalent (such as API or onchain mirror)\n* Current Agora team members added together will commit to not represent more than 5% of nouns.\n\n## Team\nYitong – Project lead & designer: co-founder of Vector DAO, and previously design + product at Coinbase. Prop builder for #87, contributor to Nouns Vision, delegate.\n\n0xcaff – Engineer: Built the v1 of Agora, previously engineer at Coinbase.\n\nTom Taubkin – Protocol Engineer: Contributor to several defi projects, previously engineer at Coinbase\n\nMrtn – Ops / Community: Delegate from nounlets, funded via Prop House as governance historian, deployed Agora on lil nouns, previously pm on nouns.builder, and pm at Google.\n\n## Funding request & terms\n**Funding request:**\n\nWe’d like to request $221,000 to fund the team for a quarter (170ETH @ $1300/ETH, a 20% decrease from previous ask) and 20 ETH to incentivize voter participation.\n\n**Fund transfer mechanics**\n\n50% of the team portion & the participation incentive will be immediately deposited to the team’s wallet\n\n50% of the team portion will be streamed over a period of three months from a 3/5 multisig held by trusted members of the community. Signers for this safe will be: Elad, Krel, Yitong, Seneca, and one more to be confirmed.\n\nAs of this writing, $221,000 is 170 ETH. In order to account for ETH volatility, we will request a 30 ETH buffer. Upon fund release, $221,000 worth of ETH will be sold, with half deposited to the Agora multisig, and half deposited to the stream multisig. The remaining ETH will be sent back to the treasury.\n\n## Appendix: some illustrative mocks\nThese are purely concepts to illustrate some of the areas we’re going to invest in. We’ll need to iterate on these designs a lot before implementing them, so please take them as general directions vs exact specs.\n\n ![](https://i.imgur.com/WiopwP2.gif)\n*Enable time-bound, fractional, and supercedable delegation by a proxy contract to unblock funds & whales who are currently unwilling to delegate*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jhXYctm.png)\n*Implement an inactive nouner bounty program, highlighting and incentivizing the community to reach out to inactive holders.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uFmaeEI.png)\n*Run a direct reward (in both ETH and NFT prizes) experiment to directly incentivize voting*\n"},{"blockNumber":15770605,"blockHash":"0x055230d9b453b967b8eb7a034f462b224c2a65324804bd34924d6d6cc6b5b726","transactionIndex":120,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xadfacf8b3da9c839ea10db2897f08a82df6df72e562702ae549115db2f438925","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":155,"proposer":"0x177751396D8236569C5C7B04232C7b7281a3B9f3","targets":["0xBD910e42a051da2252EB87B6f43d5E6e7cA85E3c"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15783745,"endBlock":15803455,"description":"# CDT Work Continuation\n\nHey all, my name is Christian. Working on Nouns full-time has been an amazing opportunity. I'd like to continue my work for the next 6 months as well. It's been an incredible learning experience, and I love building projects that serve the DAO and bring joy to the Nouns community.\n\n### **Overview of what I’ve done the last 6 months:**\n## **[PROP HOUSE](https://prop.house/)**\nI spent most of my time working on the **complete site redesign**. Besides making it more aesthetically pleasing, and cleaning up the codebase (removing unused code as we prepared to open-source it), I worked on new features to **increase the overall user experience** including:\n**-** New homepage with statistics\n**-** Dynamic social sharing cards\n**-** House & Round pages\n**-** Voting progress bar\n**-** User proposal progress card\n**-** Japanese translations\n**-** Rich text editor for prop creation\n**-** Search bar for Home, FAQ, House, and Round pages\n\n![prophouse](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/1/190db5ad7841b57c47f1765534f99ea4ea514aaf_2_1380x832.jpeg)\n\n\n\n## **[NOUNS CENTER](https://nouns.center/)**\nThe site has received **18K total site visits** and is officially **linked from the Docs tab** of [nouns.wtf](https://nouns.wtf/). It has been forked by 4 NFT communities: Lil Nouns, Mfers, Blitmap, and Forgotten Runes to be used as a tool for their community. I did automation work with Brian to allow for projects and talent to add themselves more easily as the site scales. I also shipped several new pages and updates: \n**-** Funding (plus 3 funding guides: proposals, small grants, and prop house)\n**-** SubDaos\n**-** Dev Center (Docs, APIs, contract links, and Github repos)\n**-** Discord Channels\n**-** Learn (educational content from Nouncil YouTube)\n**-** Ideas\n**-** New assets (2 Figma boards, updated color palette, and 3D voxel noggles files)\n**-** New homepage\n\n![nounscenter](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/d/dd1863e672d5828dce841f6074f1110d5bcaa06f_2_1380x834.png)\n\n## **[NOUN O' TALK](http://nounotalk.com/)**\nI released **14 episodes** with **33 guests**.

I personally edited all past episodes. I recently brought on 2 producers to increase the quality. The next push will be YouTube. I created a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR5cYWsmNUELNY7-txoba-Q) (69 subscribers) so that we can upload full episodes, as well as 3-5 video clips, each week. I am personally a big YouTube user for podcasts and I believe this will be a great way to spread the word about Nouns on a platform we don't have a huge presence in. \n\n![new_episodes](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/c/ce7a16ae87085bcb48ad405ed1a84ab0daff1ddd_2_1380x832.jpeg)\n\n### **What I plan to work on for the next 6 months:**\n\n## **[PROP HOUSE](https://prop.house/)**\nI will **continue developing the Prop House web app**. As we prepare for the protocol launch, I will work on fixing bugs and frontend improvements, as I manage the vast majority of the frontend you see. I will add Spanish translations to the site and I will continue to ensure it's the best tool that it can be.\n\n## **[NOUNS CENTER](https://nouns.center/)**\nI'd like to [conduct a Prop House round](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-prop-house-design-round-for-nouns-center/2601) for a proper redesign of the entire site and lead the development to create a **Nouns Center v2**. I will add documentation, as in a README with install instructions, and clean up the code to make it fork-friendly for other communities. I aim to **implement Search** across the entire site for easier access to all the information. I plan to **add translations** (Japanese & Spanish) too.\n\n## **[NOUN O' TALK](http://nounotalk.com/)**\nI will continue to book guests, do my own extensive interview prep, and **host the pod** itself. I also **manage the podcast team** (Messhup for art and Matthew & Brileigh, our two producers). Besides the weekly podcast I want to grow and **proliferate Nouns via YouTube** as I mentioned above. Lastly, I'd like to create a custom site for nounotalk.com.\n\n### **Funds requested:**\n\n$175K* paid over 6 months in USDC which equates to ~132E by todays valuation.\n\n*the equivalent of ~$190k (to absorb potential volatility in ETH from time period between submission and execution) would  be sent to a multisig managed by trusted members of the community (Seneca, Steve, and cdt), they would then convert $175k worth of ETH to USDC, set up the stream and then send back the remaining ETH to the DAO.\n\nThe safe to handle cdt's transaction was created at `0xBD910e42a051da2252EB87B6f43d5E6e7cA85E3c`.\n\nSigners:\nseneca: `0xfC9e8dB5E255439F430e058462360Dd52b87cB4f`\ncdt: `0x1Bf87eAd2Fc2A4751CF5Bda011E5Afa320391cc2`\nsteve: `0x7D81478Ad18ad375e53De6F74F3122F6be3499ca`\n\nRecipient\ncdt's address: `0x1Bf87eAd2Fc2A4751CF5Bda011E5Afa320391cc2`"},{"blockNumber":15772454,"blockHash":"0x873210fdad17f4bdc31eb15039d268cc49df9ef5d863f33ffef9286f1abcb8fa","transactionIndex":262,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x1440be44ad98199f63e9e343c85a12192a50305eeb420054cbf109dc37355ce4","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":156,"proposer":"0x5d4df391F56f0D8F854434E52A15b10b6501129f","targets":["0x9Ff7794DceE8a5FAf1ae91E964BC9C10E6916d6a"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15785594,"endBlock":15805304,"description":"# The Nouns AI Pod\n\n## DESCRIPTION:\n\nThe AI generated scripted, voiced over, and visuals created PROMO video for the pod :)\n\n[The AI pod promo Video!!](https://youtu.be/b5Ojfo6gVcU)\n\n### **TL;DR:**\n\nFollowing the initial AI residency, we wish to create The Nouns AI Pod.\n\nThis prop is to fund 3 months of focus on continuing the research of our resident AI researchers:\n\n1. Further empowering Roko to be an AI secretary/assistant for the DAO! Helping information flow better with summaries, transcripts, reviews, answering questions and more. \n2. Generating Nounish rich media (images, gifs, videos) and making the tools to generate such media accessible to the community at large to unleash their creativity\n3. Empowering other pods (e.g. ai-based team drafting for e-sports, planning events for otg)\n\nWith each of these being built with monetization / expansion to other organizations in mind.\n\n---\n\n### WELL HOW DID THE INITIAL RESEARCH GO?\n\nYou can see the initial small grant proposal here [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929)  and Honk's extension post here [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357)\n\n![https://imgur.com/JPkgn07](https://imgur.com/JPkgn07.png)\n\n[https://staging.roko.dev/](https://staging.roko.dev/) Is a live website where the team is experimenting and adding features with the goal of building a production ready webapp.\n\nWe initially set out to accomplish two sprints, the first to be able to break down proposals into understandable summaries / reviews. The second was more focused on demonstrating some of the possibilities of AI and what it could bring to Nouns.\n\nI am happy to report that, thanks to an engaged community and support from key contributors Honk and Evets.eth we blew that goal out of the water.\n\nTogether, we:\n\n- Held weekly sessions on Tuesdays which about 30 people regularly attended that shared developments with the project as well as educating them on fundamentals as well as cutting edge developments in machine learning\n- Built a pipeline that can breakdown proposals into reviews automatically as they as proposed on-chain (and post them to Twitter!!)\n- Built pipeline to turn recorded calls into text using SOTA voice to text then using a large language model to convert them into a bulleted summary\n\n![https://imgur.com/voyrcfZ](https://imgur.com/voyrcfZ.png)\n\n- Built a web interface that enables participants to easily consume summarized proposal content as well as edit them to better reflect their opinions\n    - [https://staging.roko.dev/](https://staging.roko.dev/)\n- Tested the ability to finetune our model using user generated content as guidance\n- Setup a backend infrastructure setup to support the ongoing development and improvement of the web interface\n- In addition, due to popular demand we began diving deep into AI generated media, we were able to generate images and video content (reactive to sound!) that features custom content (Noggles!)\n\n![https://imgur.com/hCb6gWe](https://imgur.com/hCb6gWe.png)\n\n![https://imgur.com/J1KHLy6](https://imgur.com/J1KHLy6.png)\n\n![https://imgur.com/gKTir4X](https://imgur.com/gKTir4X.png)\n\n![https://imgur.com/Vd9t0po](https://imgur.com/Vd9t0po.png)\n\n[The AI pod promo Video!!](https://youtu.be/b5Ojfo6gVcU)\n\n---\n\n### NEXT STEPS: THE AI POD\n\nThe proposed AI Pod will have 3 main focuses:\n\n1. Continue Bringing Roko to life in the form of an AI Assistant to DAO members:\n- All Nouners and teams of funded props should have access to Roko's summarization capabilities for their related audio or text content (as long as they provide feedback on their results!!)\n- Work towards improving Roko’s corpus of data (e.g. Discourse posts, Discord messages) and learn how to incorporate these into a model to improve Roko’s Nounish knowledge base.\n- Roko's website could also be updated to include a search page where people could semantically search across that knowledge base whether it is just meeting / proposal content or if Discord / Discourse content was included.\n2. Explore AI Generated Media\n- Implement and host SOTA open source image generation models customized to be able to generate Noggles on powerful GPU servers so any DAO member can access it. \n- Implement cutting edge developments as they are released (e.g. text to video, img to img, text to 3d, etc.), share our knowledge with the community, and incentivize their use!\n3. Community Engagement, Marketing, and Outreach (Competitions!!)\n- Put together competitions (with prizes!!) alongside groups like NoC to show off the best showcases of AI generated media leveraging Nouns AI tooling.\n- Assist various pods and DAO members with content generation - we've already had suggestions from helping visualize proposals to making and AI content generated coffee book and I know the community will have plenty more great ideas!!\n- Potential prop house round for utilizing the tooling?\n- Seek out partnerships with these opensource or other organizations to see if they would be interested in collaborating to try and further proliferate the brand!\n    - I’d LOVE to see us partner with some musicians to work with them to make them free music videos they could post that have Noun glasses in them or have a live show with AI generated visuals featuring Noggles\n\n---\n\n### THE FUTURE OF AI POD:\n\nHopefully, during these three months, we will be able to not only share significant advancements in AI with the community, but also have a plan for how to take the next steps to grow the AI Pod further.\nWe want to be able to show a path where this could become a self-sustaining effort that could grow and expand to other organizations, opening up a pipeline for monetization.\nWe believe that this is a great opportunity to only grow and expand the Nouns ecosystem but give everyone who is a part of it superpowers that help proliferating the meme!!\n\n---\n\n### TEAM:\n\n- The Hero Shep (Background in AI/Education/Product Management)\n- Honk Diddly (Wizard [elite full stack developer])\n- Evets.ETH (Wizard [full stack developer])\n\n---\n\n### BUDGET: 164 ETH\n\n- 10% for all related infra (5k/mo)\n- 30% for The Hero Shep (20k per month)\n- 25% for Honk (15k per month)\n- 15% for Evets.ETH (10k per month)\n- 20% for Marketing and Community Engagement (Not only compensation for prizes but also to pay people to manage / run the competitions (e.g. prop house, NOC contests) & support other initiatives that arise. )\n\nBUFFER of 15% for volatility - All ETH not used strictly for reasons relating to volatility in ETH price or infra will be added to the Marketing and Community Engagement Funds\n\nThis budget will be governed by the members of the AI Pod and controlled by a 2/3 multi-sig."},{"blockNumber":15775877,"blockHash":"0x305490b33a91d8eb5cf1f249ed24919a30d1f0cb9431075013acacba077f9372","transactionIndex":145,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x9502586794b9c7d75d91fea37a93ce27eacef37039b8942b99d261e932ac4fd8","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":157,"proposer":"0xd44e9b676e74aE45C0A39150be771Eb189BB2337","targets":["0x027c8c6B4ddf6103EA95D528c67bbd436c4577eD"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15789017,"endBlock":15808727,"description":"# SaveArtSpace x Nouns Billboard Exhibition in NYC\n\nSaveArtSpace x Nouns Billboard Exhibition\nA Mix of Static Billboards & Digital Bus Shelters for $40k USD in NYC:\n\n8 - Billboards sized 22x11 - will be live for at least 4 weeks, up till someone else buys the space.\n6 - Digital Bus Shelters - will be live for 4 weeks total.\n\nLocations can be selected from a map/list of options.

This activation will be a localized nounish experience with photo opportunities, games, merchandise, and an NFT gallery. The proliferation of culture á la nounish. The following are examples of what happened in Bogotá and what we’ll create for San Francisco with a different flavor:\n\n**Photo-opportunity & noggles**\nA fully Nouns-branded photo station where attendees can take selfies and full-body photos will serve as a welcoming station. We want to create a photo set where people can feel nounish and share it on the internet. Of course, physical noggles are key.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XGMsKWG.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/i9Ww7cU.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/W9LifGd.jpg)\n\n\n\n**Games**\nTwo different games will be available at the place: **foosball**, and **a traditional local game**. We believe these games have a nounish feeling and will serve as an engagement factor.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/14ONVu1.jpg)\n\n\n\n**Merchandise**\nPins, stickers, and T-shirts will be distributed as rewards for spending time and engaging with the Nouns Fair by playing games and taking photos.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TEqCnbF.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/exzjPyD.jpg)\n\n\n\n**NFT gallery**\nA 5 screens NFT gallery representing local artists and some nounish representatives.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SvvfxNS.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iCu328D.jpg)\n\n\n**Costs and execution**\nGiven our past experiences and the recent Nouns Fairs at ETHMexico and ETHBogota, we came up with this budget to make it suitable for ETHSanFrancisco in the US. **We are asking for 23.25 ETH**.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XSlixrD.png)\n\n\nCosts are approximate. ETH avg. price of 1,200 USD. Prices in red are not final and we'll seek to reduce costs as much as possible. The difference in these prices will be returned to the DAO.\n\nWe are excited about this new opportunity to keep creating nounish experiences IRL that can be replicated in other countries. But most of all, to spread the ⌐◨-◨ in a fun way!\n\n**Transactions**\nDue to the time sensitive nature of this proposal, NSFW has already funded NounsDAOAmigos to execute on this project.

Expect it to be a \"bloody nounish shindig with all ya mates\" – an invitation to join [Nouns DAO'n Under](https://twitter.com/nounsau).\n\n### Live nounish panel discussion\n\nLeaning on a previous [nounish panel discussion during NFT London](https://nftlondon.sessionize.com/session/382247), we will focus on explaining what it means to be nounish, through the lens of building atop Nouns DAO and highlighting case studies such as Gnars. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wgYSrFJ.jpg)\n\nThe goal of such an approach is to inspire others to come and build on Nouns while showing future nouners the potential unlocked by joining the DAO. Our own launch of Nouns DAO'n Under also serves as a [Nouns Builder](https://nouns.build) case study. \n\n### Noggles worn by event staff\n\nOur iconic noggles are wildly underutilised, especially in the context of collaborative branding and marketing opportunities. We are paving the way and defining our own category as the official \"optical sponsor.\" \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tb9UvSm.jpg)\n\nAdditional to Gold Sponsorship benefits: \n* Branding on the registration page \n* Panel speaking opportunity \n* Branding on homepage\n* Branding across social collateral \n* VIP access to all events\n* Speaker concierge service\n* Logo on media wall\n* Branding on NFT Fest '22 banners \n* Feature inserts\n* Bespoke collateral\n* Branding on ticket & event webpage\n* Branding on event collateral\n* Event ticket allocation\n* Inclusion in email communication to attendees pre/during/post event \n* NFT Fest social media channels recognition pre/during/post event\n\nNFT Fest's organisers and event staff have proudly agreed to wear noggles to show their appreciation, make the event unforgettably nounish and of course, have fun!\n\n### Street poster campaign\n\nTo raise awareness in the leadup to and during NFT Fest, we will print and distribute 200 x A0 sized street posters in key locations around St Kilda.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iUV8NCU.jpg)\n\nMr Boney has run similar campaigns in Melbourne to great effect. Prior to rebranding Douns to Nouns DAO'n Under, he received funding from Nouncil to run a tracked experiment and we're able to leverage the relationships built.\n\n## Nouns DAO Contribution\n\n**Required funding (22 ETH) as follows:**\n\n- Optical Sponsor package including Gold sponsorship (10 ETH)\n- Dioramic POAP powered photo booth activation (5 ETH)\n- Silver Sponsorship on behalf of Gnars DAO (3 ETH)\n- Merchandise to hand out during the event (2 ETH)\n- St Kilda targeted street poster campaign (2 ETH)\n\nWe trust that voters will appreciate the importance and foreseeable impact of making a lasting impression on the Australian scene.

Seeking to catch fresh eyes and celebrate the strides made so far, the future potential and why it’s such an exciting time to get involved in the Nouns project.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CEhktTX.gif)\n\n## Who is NeverSitStill?\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/wz4HFXO.png)](https://vimeo.com/675295630)\n\n[Homepage](https://neversitstill.com/) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/neversitstill.tv/) | [Behance](https://www.behance.net/NeverSitStill)\n\nNever Sit Still is highly experienced in creating premium brand films, often focused on abstract or hard-to-explain concepts. We have collaborated with many high caliber clients in and out of web3 such as:\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/7kdbuvP.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/586628568)\n\n\n[Compound](https://www.behance.net/gallery/129713109/Compound-III) - Compound III is a collateralised borrowing protocol that optimizes capital efficiency, gas costs, and security.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/ugBEZmu.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/715516917)\n\n[STL](https://www.behance.net/gallery/146273121/Smart-Token-Labs-TokenScript) - A revolutionary new Web3 technology designed to take Token Gating to the next level.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/mjRPzlF.png)](https://vimeo.com/553216699)\n\n\n[Coinbase](https://www.behance.net/gallery/131256363/Coinbase) - Coinbase is the easiest place to buy and sell cryptocurrency, via a trusted and easy-to-use platform for accessing the broader crypto economy.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/yeJCvDP.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/575631888)\n\n[Adobe Splash Screen](https://www.behance.net/gallery/129640141/Adobe-After-Effects) - Each year, Adobe commissions artists from a variety of disciplines and styles to show off the power of Creative Cloud by producing custom artwork to represent each product.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/auygyYd.png)\n\nWe at NeverSitStill encourage creative thinking  and personal development amongst the company,  which lead to a conversation about Nouns with motion designer [James Vallance (MrSEAKs)](https://twitter.com/SeaksMr). His collaboration earlier this year with Gnars DAO, and his work with Gami (Noun 189), to create an animated piece for NFT NYC proliferating Nouns. A major component of Nouns' participation in NFT NYC.\n\nSee more here: [Full video](https://create.zora.co/collections/0xdcbca59d38eb3abfcb5055fe7bd7f5ce027d03c3) | [Artist BTS & NY billboard footage](https://twitter.com/SeaksMr/status/1553862678795661312)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8ja4qFe.png)\n\n## Proposal\n\n### What will we make for you?\n\nA 30-60 second, crafted hype video that represents Nouns in an exciting way. Exploring Nounish themes through visual metaphor, celebrating the culture with existing users, and onboarding the new.\n\nThink of it as an above-the-funnel video encapsulating the key themes of Nouns in a punchy, artistic, and fresh video to make people go WTF is Nouns?\n\nThe look and tone of the piece will be designed to capture attention, potentially becoming an ownable style for future Nouns advertising and messaging material. \n\nIt's a catalyst video to start the gravitational pull that is Nouns.\n\n### What is the video going to be about?\n\nThe video will represent strong themes that Nouns focuses on through visual metaphor:\n\n- Use case of NFTs for raising funds for positive change\n- Evolution and growth of Nouns\n- DAOs/community\n- Bootstrapping/launchpad\n- Interaction of Nouns and IRL, bringing the power of crypto to IRL\n\nWith these ideas at the core, we spin them into a powerful narrative that follows the birth of the Noggles and its exponential growth to become an object of power, one for positive change in the world.\n\nTo represent the multi-faceted nature of the Nouniverse, we intend to use a mixed-media approach, with input from various artists within our team. Distinct flavours coming together to create one visual style in a seamless video.\n\nWe feel this approach also carries the spirit of the Nouns DAO. A diverse pool of people building something great together.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/A0oZVgy.jpg)\n\n### The Nouniverse & Big Bang\n\nIn the beginning, at the centre of it all is the Noggle. The Noggle atom, molecule, cell, animal, vegetable, mineral. We want to place the Noggle at the centre of this big bang and follow the narrative of it's growing impact on the universe.\n\nThis rippling wave will take effect on the world around it, transforming and creating. What does the world look like through a Nounish lens?\n\n### Why hype video?\n\nThe current state of our fast-paced digital world needs information to be condensed into a highly digestible format to relay anything valuable.\n\n[Prop 143](https://nouns.wtf/vote/143) spoke to the fantastic concept of the video marketing funnel. To borrow a term from the Nounish team, we want to talk to the top of the funnel and go even more front-facing, above the funnel. This is why it’s important to create a first point of contact with broader audiences that inspires them to care about what they’re seeing. We want to ignite a spark within viewers to seek out and learn more about Nouns of their own volition.\n\nA hype video executes this perfectly. A short, visually rich video, presented in an artistic, eye-catching way, that grabs people's attention and hooks them in, down the Nouns rabbit hole.\n\n### Do traditional hype videos work in web3?\n\nIt’s well known that video is a perfect medium to promote and create awareness of a brand/product. Hype videos are a tool used by luxury brands within web2 and we want to bring these tried and tested methods to web3 and Nouns.\n\nTake the promo video for [Doodles v2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv9TaQ5z9jw), or the [Otherside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1equGhkQE) Yuga Labs video. These are both great examples of highly crafted, short animated hype videos to blow up awareness of a brand/product to funnel new audiences into web3 and their brand.\n\nThese videos aren't about explaining how, but what and why.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IbzEFzH.gif)\n\n### Video Lifespan\n\nA hype video has a long shelf life and is easy to re-use. Whenever you need promotional content, take an already existing hype video and place it at the front of marketing to interest viewers.\n\nCombine the re-usability of a hype video with assets that are CC0 and you have a piece of art that can be re-used, re-jigged, and a video that can live on for a long time.\n\nRender characters, assets, scenes, and the entire video as CC0 for all to share and spread Nouns proliferation.\n\n### Meta\n\nAir-drop current Noun owners their very own piece of this hype video in the form of NFTs created from scenes of the entire piece. This will create a collection of different NFTs from the entire video.\n\nOwners could even trade/swap/collect these separate NFTs to piece together the sequence and receive a rare airdrop of the entire video minted as an NFT. This is a way to celebrate the creation of the work, and reward holders who were already a part of the ecosystem when it happened.\n\nPOAPs for voters. Incentive to vote, a reward for being involved in bringing this project of Nouns proliferation to life.\n\n## Process\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pjCL5wT.png)\n\n### Process\n\nWe use a traditional linear pipeline for development, from concept through to mastering. This stepped approach allows us to spend an appropriate amount of time in each phase, delivering top notch work in an efficient timeline. At each major milestone, our clients give condensed feedback to ensure that the work is communicating its message clearly.\n\nTo ensure the work is original and ownable, we use a period of time for high level research and development. This means we aren't aiming to re-create a reference, but build something new and ownable for the Nouns DAO.\n\n### Pre production\n\n- R&D (Community liaisons to guide content)\n- Concept art, thumbnails\n- Design, visual language development\n- Storyboarding\n- Animatic\n\n### Production\n\n- Animation\n- Music development\n- NFT + POAP creation\n\n### Post-Production\n\n- Compositing, Grading\n- Sound design\n- Mastering\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- Brand hype video (Widescreen 16:9, 4K, 30fps) [archival master + web ready]\n- Working files\n- NFT ready exports (TBD with community)\n- POAP artwork (TBD with community)\n\n### Production Schedule\n\nPre production to begin before EOY if approved.\n\nFull production starting no later than January 8th, taking approximately 10-12 weeks to complete the final piece.\n\n### Communications\n\nRegular updates and WIP process interaction with the Nouns community is important. We want to build in public and share progress openly. Our team is comfortable with Discord and presentation, major milestones will be submitted for the community to feedback as well as enjoy the process.\n\n**Contact**\n\n**Gami**  *Noun 189*\n**Discord** 0xigami#0001\n**Twitter** [0xigami](https://twitter.com/0xigami)\n\n**James Vallance**  *NSS Motion Designer, MrSEAKs*\n**Discord** MrSeaks#0944\n**Twitter** [seaksmr](https://twitter.com/seaksmr)\n\n**John Grist**  *NSS Creative Lead*\n**Discord** brunch#5470\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HIqJvZt.gif)\n\n## Cost\n\n### Pricing\n\n- Approx 2.5 months production time\n- Project Management\n- Visual Development\n- Design\n- Motion\n- Custom Music Track\n- SFX (Sound Design)\n- NFT & POAP Development\n- Source Files under CC0\n\n**110 ETH / 160K USD (approx)**\n\n## Proposed Transactions\n\n- [Multi-sig Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x44ddf107C7B920312a98F4753Ba209443428c881/home) has been established at [neversitstill.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/neversitstill.eth)\n- Signers include [0xigami.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xigami.eth), [mrseaks.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/mrseaks.eth) and [a company address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2eF00c3860bC6Fe48b2508620a883E9b1f90d90F)\n- Upon receipt ETH will be swapped for USDC to hedge volatility\n- 50% upfront swapped for AUD, remaining 50% at completion\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ls1xRxa.png)"},{"blockNumber":15847688,"blockHash":"0x71943f375a5ae8acb8edb3ffe1ee6c000e8b1b9ae4611d2c24091a3622bc20f2","transactionIndex":96,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x9763af937ac0762e0e20866f3e3ecec74938422b3014ae4291b8535887b5d361","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":166,"proposer":"0x5D802e2Fe48392c104Ce0401C7ECa8a4456f1F16","targets":["0x5474d4eF13b7f6A280266015a852a7Fa13561262"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15862088,"endBlock":15898088,"description":"# NounsOTG x Stoopid Buddy x Rose Parade\n\n**What do 2 on-chain Props, 1 fifty-foot float made of flowers, and 6 life-sized Nouns have in common?**\n\n\n\nThey will all be in one place to ring in the New Year for the largest nounish proliferation event ever!

NounsOTG will be working directly with the team at Stoopid Buddy in person on the ground for 10 days during this event. The Stoopid Buddy team has covered all build and production costs for the float during this event in [Proposal 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73). After multiple conversations discussing how this event could be further bolstered, Aubtoshi and NounsOTG have been asked to be a part of this event. NounsOTG plans on adding to the already-established effort that Prop 73 has put forth in the following ways:\n\n**10 Days of On The Ground Activations + Brand Ambassadors**\n\nAfter Christmas, all of the floats for the parade (which are being framed out and built off-site) are transported to their final location prior to the parade, which is where thousands of volunteers come to help decorate the floats with flowers. This time period will include full days of OTG (On The Ground) interviews, filming, activations with volunteers, activations with people who are waiting for the event to begin, and more. We will also be filming with the life-sized nounish “walk-arounds” (nouns costumes made by Stoopid Buddy, creators of costumes seen on the celebrity singing show “The Masked Singer”) during this time. Post-event, the floats will be staged in a different holding area to be observed and photographed one last time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5jlT56O.jpg)\n*Nounish \"Walk-Arounds\" by SB*\n\n\nAdditionally, NounsOTG will scout and hire 10 trained brand ambassadors that will be active the day before the parade, during the parade and afterwards, and at the Rose Bowl when handing out the mini limited edition footballs. The responsibilities of these ambassadors will include being on-brand, walking (waving, jumping, dancing) in a 5-mile parade line. We have allowed for the cost of their food and beverages during specific meal times, transportation to and from the event from the staging area, additional hours on the day prior during the final prep; as well as team meetings, zoom calls and fittings prior to the event, as we plan to deck them out in Nouns Brand and other nounish swag.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sbu1t1L.png)\n\n**Special Guest DJ + Custom DJ Set On The Float + Over 18,000 Nounish Giveaways**\n\nThe DJ will be none other than **Richerd Intern**, and his crew will perform with a full/unique set during the live event! Although the parade float images are still not public or released, I can reveal that there will indeed be room for Richerd... \n\nHis team is London based and the cost comes directly from their team and includes their travel and accommodation. We couldn't be more nounish with the Noun266 (Chart Bars Noun head) if we tried!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JiJ5BwX.png)\n\nOver the course of 10 days, we will be handing out over 18,000 unique nounish items, including limited edition mini footballs and shirts, low-fi paper noggles, sticker packs and nouns temporary tattoos. Our goal is to get these items national television coverage during both the parade and rose bowl game. Noggles on the faces in the audience and children throwing nounish mini footballs would be a lasting image during this important holiday event. This opportunity has allowed OTG to connect to other nounish builders and we are open to further collaborations with Nouners and builders.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jp42GOh.jpg)\n\n\n**Immediate Impact**\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with the Rose Parade or its impact, it is one of the major events of the year as the 5 mile parade ends with the start of the Rose Bowl football game. Outside of the 37 million viewers at home, the entire area of Southern California is focused on this event for several weeks prior!\n\nOver **1 Million people** will be in attendance on the day of the parade with a live broadcast to over 37 Million additional individuals nationwide. With a 5 mile parade line and an entire week of content creation and nounish item giveaways prior to the parade as the float is brought to completion, this will be one of the key proliferation event opportunities of the year for NounsDAO. Not to mention the day after the event sees 60-100k attendees that visit the floats to get a close up look at all the details - another amazing activation opportunity.   \n\n\n\n\n**Proposal Cost Breakdown**\n\nTotal ETH: 52, Total USDC: $78,000 *amount calculated with 1 ETH = $1,500 USD\n\n\n* 2.77 ETH: 250 Limited Edition Shirts (Nouns X Stoopid Buddy X Rose Parade)\n* 3.50 ETH: 5000 Stickers packs & 5000 Temporary Tattoos + Nounish MVPs for product placement\n* 5.65 ETH: Full custom DJ set by special guest DJ (includes Travel & Accommodation for their team)\n* 6.45 ETH: 10 Nouns Brand Ambassadors walking next to the parade and handing out items\n* 6.55 ETH: 250 Limited Edition Footballs (Nouns X Stoopid Buddy X Rose Parade)\n* 11.72 ETH: On-Site Coordination & Production Management: Aubtoshi & Emma & 2 PAs (10 days)\n* 14.84 ETH: Travel Costs & Accommodation & Staging Area for Items (10 days)\n* 0.00 ETH: 7000 Lo-fi Paper Noggles (Send purchase order to NSFW, no additional funding needed)\n* 0.52 ETH: Fees to cover for multi-sig transactions outlined below\n\nTo account for any ETH volatility during the time this prop goes through the voting process, we are adding an additional 10 ETH to this prop. After the initial conversion to USDC, any extra eth from this 10 ETH will be immediately sent back to the DAO. Additionally, any ETH left from the Travel Costs & Accommodation budget will also be sent back to the DAO.\n**Total ETH amount requested from NounsDAO: 62 ETH**\n\nAll funds will be held in a multi-sig wallet that will initiate the following transactions:\n* Convert ETH to $78,000 USDC ($780 for txn fees)\n* Send any remaining ETH back to the NounsDAO\n* $3,395 USDC: Sent to PA1 for on-site production assistance during 10 days\n* $3,395 USDC: Sent to PA2 for on-site production assistance during 10 days\n* $5,395 USDC: Sent to Aubtoshi for production coordination payment\n* $5,395 USDC: Sent to Emma for production coordination payment \n* $8,475 USDC: Sent to DJ + team upon confirmation of their booking and release forms collected\n* $9,405 USDC: Sent to OTG to order Stickers, Temporary Tattoos and Shirts\n* $9,675 USDC: Sent to OTG to have payment ready for OTG Brand Ambassadors\n* $9,825 USDC: Sent to VSVSVS to order limited edition footballs\n* $22,260 USDC: Sent to OTG to book travel/accommodation/food/additional costs\n\n**The multisig (2/3) signers are:** \n\n[**Aubtoshi**](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/aubtoshi.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)\n[**Toady Hawk**](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/toadyhawk.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8) \n**Nounder 9999**\n\n\n**Long-Term Value**\n\nStoopid Buddy has been actively engaged in the community and are clearly delivering on their prop. Outside of creating a successful experience at the event itself, footage from the event will be used in the documentary outlined in [Proposal 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73). I have been to the studio in Burbank, I have met the walk-around craftsman and have been trusted by the Stoopid Buddy team to see confidential alpha from their News Years Event and participate in production conversations leading up to it. \n\nThis additional push to create a nounish experience and vibe during the event will connect Nouns directly with all the many people in attendance, plus brand new audiences at home. **While the SB crew are focused on long form video for their documentary, this proposal will allow me and my team to supplement that content with visceral and viral short-form content perfect for social media. All our content will of course be made CC0 and available for future use, ensuring that the DAO's investment in this event is documented and that our brand is seen and experienced by an even broader audience than those reached by the documentary and broadcasts alone.** \n\nProp 73 will go down as one of the most successful funded proposals to date for NounsDAO, not only for its reach and high quality production, but for real nounish interaction with so many real people. I feel honored to have been asked by SB to help with the on-site activation piece for the Rose Bowl Parade, to ensure that our Nouns national television coverage has the best visuals possible with lasting effects. I look forward to the opportunity to bring this NounsOTG activation to life!\n"},{"blockNumber":15876623,"blockHash":"0x2b9c155a086d6915fff1484f5b7d867eec2f7cf5a8c64027ad190c5271be724e","transactionIndex":123,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x963637d8960013853c3d692e476d8f42a18aebd3b001c765886919db0119b19a","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":167,"proposer":"0xd1d1D4e36117aB794ec5d4c78cBD3a8904E691D0","targets":["0xC20Dac0B62b28eddE0C44aB1BE2206a1c48e6A67"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15891023,"endBlock":15927023,"description":"# Nouns Builder Protocol\n\n# Nouns Builder Protocol\n### Public Infrastructure brought to you by Zora and NounsDAO\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JycpSjR.png)\n\n**Mainnet Launch:** November 1st\n**Expected DAO Launch:** November 15th\n**Website:** [nouns.build](https://nouns.build)\n**Twitter:** [@nounsbuilder](http://twitter.com/nounsbuilder)\n\nLike you, we believe that Nouns DAO is a significant form factor innovation for NFTs and DAOs. Instead of giving all power and capital solely to a project’s founders, the Nouns model enables communities to emerge progressively, and to be active participants in how their brand and community evolves.\n\nWe believe that more Nouns forks should exist - so we’re building a tool anyone can use to build them.\n\nFor the past couple of months we have been working on the Nouns Builder: a product that makes it easy for anyone to create their own Nouns DAO with any art, any auction cadence and flexible DAOs that can evolve over time.\n\nAs we’ve been building this tool, we’ve increasingly realized that it makes sense to use this very tool to create a DAO that will govern, sustain and develop the Nouns Builder project itself. By doing so, Nouns builder can:\n* Demonstrate the utility of Nouns Builder as a public good\n* Utilize the ecosystem of tools in Nouns: Prop House, Agora\n* Experiment using the NounsDAO model as an alternative to the subDAO multisig\n* Experiment using the NounsDAO model to proliferate a protocol and products\n* Expand use of the NounsDAO model as a more effective governance model for collective decision making\n* Share governance of this DAO with Nouns, Zora, and future contributors as interested in expanding the horizon of this public infrastructure as we are. \n\nWe are going to call this DAO “Builder”, with its own art and NFT that will be minted each day. Builder will be NounsDAO from day 1, with the goal of proliferating this infrastructure.\n\n**Core details to note:**\n\n* Based on extensive feedback from the Nouns community, the protocol is entirely free. There is currently no protocol wide fee.\n* DAOs can opt in to gift a certain amount of their NFTs to Nouns or any other DAO or platform\n* In prior versions of the proposal, we proposed that NounsDAO would be the deployer of the Builder DAO. Based on feedback from the community we have removed this aspect of the proposal.\n* The protocol development has been extensive, with careful consideration made to\n    * Enable DAOs to easily upgrade and evolve themselves over time in a safe manner\n    * Be gas efficient\n    * Open up room for exploration around new distribution types like VRGDAs\n* The protocol has been audited via Code4rena, with Zora paying $129K USDC ($90k in prizes) to complete it.\n* We have built an easy to use tool at [nouns.build](https://nouns.build) where over 60 testnet DAOs have been created in the process of testing and refining the user experience.\n\n**Ask:**\n\n1000 ETH contribution to seed the Nouns Builder DAO treasury to help this public good reach its full potential. \n\n\n**Completed Work:**\n\nRather than requesting retroactive reward for development, ***we are asking NounsDAO to pay it forward* by seeding the Builder treasury with ETH** for funding the development of the Nouns Builder protocol as a public good and expansion of the ecosystem by the community. \n\nZora contributed ~4 months of development time on creating the Nouns Builder protocol\n* Full time contributions from the Zora solidity, backend, and front end engineering teams\n* Full time design and creative direction for Nouns Builder artworks.\n* ~100 ETH spent on the Code4rena audit.\n\nThis contribution to the Nouns Builder DAO treasury means there is sufficient Day 1 capital to immediately conduct prop house mandates and funding rounds for the development, proliferation, and accessibility of the protocol and ecosystem for the benefit of the public.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n* Audited Nouns Builder smart contracts.\n* Custom Nouns Builder generative artwork (CC0).\n* Builder DAO for anyone in the community to join and contribute.\n\n**All of the ETH will be going to the Nouns Builder DAO treasury.**\n\n**Builder DAO:**\n\nThe Builder DAO is created using the Nouns Builder tool and protocol. It is the entity onchain that will be responsible for funding the proliferation of the ecosystem and development of the protocol over time. \n\nWe believe Nouns Builder represents critical public infrastructure for community decision making, and we want to use the full power of the NounsDAO model to further this protocol and ecosystem of different apps built on top of it, as well as being able to natively tap into tools in the ecosystem like Prop House and Agora.\n\nBuilderDAO creators will receive the following governance rights in the Builder DAO for a period of 5 years after Builder DAO’s launch to allow the creators to support of the growth and development of this public good while in its nascency:\n* 1/10 to zora.eth\n* 1/20 to nouns.eth\n\nFor clarity, DAO members shall not receive any revenues from Builder DAO daily auctions. All funds in the Treasury shall be dedicated to improving the Builder DAO protocol and its public good function, and growing the community, brand, and ecosystem. \n\nThe Builder DAO will start with a daily auction. The NFTs that will be minted each day are a nounish artwork that expands on the ideas of “Internet flags”, a collection of unicode symbols that communities can organize around, with the nounish colors at its core, as well as the noggles.\n\nHere is a sample of the codex below:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kArgmJn.png)\n\n\n**NounsDAOs for Public Infrastructure:**\n\nWe believe it is important to experiment with Nouns forks as a way to further particular pieces of infrastructure within the nounish ecosystem. Instead of funded LLCs and companies to ultimately manage tools like Nouns Builder and things like Prop House, we want to actively explore using a Nounish DAO as the primary entity to further a public protocol and an ecosystem of many platforms built on top of it. \n\nThis is why we are leading from the front with the Builder DAO. We are also optimistic that this can become a blueprint for any team that is developing protocols—like Zora itself. \n\n**Sustainability:**\n\nIn prior proposals there have been open questions around the future models for sustainability without need for persistent funding from NounsDAO all the time. We believe that this is the first meaningful step in this direction, and we hope to set a precedent and blueprint for future teams to build sustainable Public Infrastructure that is native to the Nouns ecosystem and DAO itself.\n\n**Transaction Details:**\n\n1000 ETH transferred to an escrow smart contract that will hold the funds until the Builder DAO is live and operational. We are expecting this to be live on approximately November 15th.\n\n**References:**\n[Discourse post](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-builder-draft/2007)\n[Prop house](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/prop-house-protocol-public-infrastructure-by-nouns-dao/1594)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yPwwE6T.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M31ZnVx.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GLLYhTu.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"blockNumber":15911793,"blockHash":"0x5bfa548e782a4a4c80e121e43846ded7a91a0a7aa5718db84065bd15fa236dba","transactionIndex":112,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xd4be747509d8b0d1d5fdee9bf7137227f5a5c7df8db51618038dec6c7279a789","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":168,"proposer":"0x55b0a25d697647281553a177321DAd0a0Bf9A148","targets":["0x797C89d2b75D359B0404c1760974c6f48a84A88C"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15926193,"endBlock":15962193,"description":"# Nouns x MrBeast\n\nA proposal drafted by [**Hindsight**](https://twitter.com/0Hindsight) (ProNouns: NFT/OG) with the support of [**Jarmen**](https://twitter.com/jarmen43) (a man struggling to tell his wife he is a zebra on the internet) and [**Sam Ellis**](https://twitter.com/manofmissle) (Chief Meme Officer)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Dz7SOwt.jpg)\n\n&nbsp;\n## **HOW TO VOTE ON THIS PROPOSAL**\n\n* **Vote Yes:** If you think it would be good value for DAO to pay 500 Eth to have a Nounish focused episode on the most watched show on the internet - with a money back guarantee if it doesn’t happen. \n* **Vote No:** If you don’t think that would be good value.\n* **Abstain:** If you gift people toasters for their wedding.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **THE CHALLENGE**\nThis proposal requests that the DAO fund a project for **500 eth** in order to proliferate the Nouns by running **a competition, open to anyone, to** **convince** [**Mr. Beast**](https://www.youtube.com/user/mrbeast6000) **to give away $500k (340 Eth)**, preferably to charity, on his YouTube channel, given to him by the Nouns in a Nounish focused episode of his show.\n\n**The person or people that convince Mr. Beast to do this will be rewarded with a $250k prize.**\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **THE REWARD**\nThe $250k Reward will be awarded to the person or people that Mr. Beast credits with convincing him to accept the challenge on the following terms:\n\n*   $175k if he accepts the request and does the show.\n*   An additional $75k if he gives the majority (>50%) of the $500k to charity. (This can be the same person and message or different people and messages)\n*   The episode must be on Mr. Beasts main YouTube channel.\n*   The Nouns must be featured on the show for any of the funds to be paid out.\n\nSo it might be a good idea for people to submit ideas to Mr. Beast that inspires him to meet these criteria. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **TOTAL COST**\nIf this proposal passes but no one can convince Mr. Beast to take on and complete the project within the next 9 months – all the Eth will be returned to the Treasury. **Total Cost of 0 Eth.**\n\nIf this proposal passes and someone is successful in convincing Mr. Beast to feature the Nouns in the most watched show on the internet while hopefully giving a lot of money away to good causes it will have a **Total Cost of 500 Eth.**\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **WHY MR. BEAST?**\nHe is the most watched person on the internet (with over 100m subscribers and up to 300m views on his videos), so I think Nouns featuring on his show would bring awareness to Nouns, NFTs, DAOs and Ethereum to millions. In doing so, it will allow people to see the great creative initiatives that Nouns are working on and have funded (e.g.[73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73))  as well as charities it has supported (e.g. [104](https://nouns.wtf/vote/104) ,[42](https://nouns.wtf/vote/42) ). On top of this I would hope it will showcase the ability of a decentralised network of people to raise funds and successfully deploy those funds in innovative ways that leverages its community to make big things happen!\n\nMr. Beast already has a good awareness of crypto and he has a history of giving to charity at a large scale too so hopefully he will be able to bring awareness to all of this in a thoughtful, considered, and fun way.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **A $250k REWARD … THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY!?**\nI can imagine some Nouners balking at the $250k prize being paid to whoever can convince Mr. Beast to take on this challenge, which is understandable.\n\nMy goal is to create value for the DAO and while one could argue that people will take on this challenge for a smaller amount – we just don’t know if it would be _as_ effective and ultimately it will always be a guess as to what the _right_ figure is.\n\nThe goal is to mobilise 99.9% of the internet and get them interested in making this happen through the incentive of a big reward. And while no one can be certain of the exact figure that would be most effective, what I _do_ know is that $250k has a high chance of success. It will advertise itself by getting people talking about it and it will massively increase the chances of the challenge being accepted. I believe we would rather potentially pay more to increase the chances of success.\n\nWhile it is a lot of money, I think it presents extremely good value. Price is what you pay and value is what you get. If no one can make it happen, nothing gets paid out and the price is zero. But if someone does make it happen, a $750k price to have the Nouns featured on the most watched show on the internet will provide great value.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **WHAT DO I GET FROM THIS?**\nNothing\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Terms and Conditions**\n*   Transfer will be made to the prize winner after the video has aired on YouTube.\n*   Mr. Beast cannot refer himself as the person to win the prize.\n*   If Mr. Beast decides to do the show but does not (or can not) identify the person or message that convinced him to take it on - the $250k will be put into a prop house round where $50k will be awarded to 5 charities as voted on by Nouners.\n*   The $500k (340 Eth) will be transferred from the multisig to Mr. Beast upon written agreement between the parties.\n*   For the interest of transparency and to avoid conflicts of interest: I am not Mr. Beast nor do I have any affiliation with him in any way. If (somehow) it is me or this proposal that convinces him to do the challenge or to do it for charity, I will pledge the prize fund to charity and no Nounder will be eligible to win this prize.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Funds**\nIf the proposal passes, Eth to the equivalent of $750k will be converted to USDC to fund the challenge and any excess will be returned to the treasury. \n\nThe funds will remain in the multisig until either the challenge is accepted or converted back to Eth and returned to the treasury after 9 months if the challenge is not accepted.\n\nThe funds will be held in a 2 / 3 Multisig with the signatures being:\n\n*   Hindsight - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0Hindsight) - [Agora](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/0xhindsight.eth)\n*   Jarmen - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jarmen43)\n*   Sam Ellis - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/manofmissle) - [Agora](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/thepencil.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)"},{"blockNumber":15938629,"blockHash":"0xcf78e345e0af428c23057f6407df8e70359e4606533419dc0fcdec36431b058b","transactionIndex":69,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xe79e8ed55d5f6e918699a05b9971c8310c4a17e723887505cabedf64b50ef4bf","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":169,"proposer":"0x05A286e5165D72823A749B00b009a2aF0dc36Ff7","targets":["0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d"],"signatures":["_setImplementation(address)"],"calldatas":["0x00000000000000000000000051c7d7c47e440d937208bd987140d6db6b1e4051"],"startBlock":15953029,"endBlock":15989029,"description":"# Nouns DAO V2.1 Minor Fix\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal updates the Nouns DAO logic contract to a new version, with a single minor improvement:\n\n**Vote with Gas Refund**: change refund destination such that multisig voter that pays for gas get refunded, rather than sending the refund to the multisig contract. \n\nTechnically, this change involves refunding `tx.origin` instead of `msg.sender`.\n\nExact changes can be seen here: https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/604\n\nBecause this change is very minor, we're not going through an official audit process.

The first in the pipeline is a nounish NNS version of EtherScan. \n* Launch the Nounish Club project to push proliferation in and outside the Nouniverse through a new experiment of community reward and participation.\n* Create a full documentation for end-users and developers expanding the ways in which they can integrate the NNS in their projects.\n* Start the first experiments and collaborations for Phase 3.\n\n**Requesting** funding of 195 ETH to execute our Expansion Phase.\n\nFunds will be immediately converted in USDC to avoid volatility exposure of any kind.\n\n[![NNS-proposal-artwork-2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/yd7g5qPr/NNS-proposal-artwork-2.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/SXtx2vHW)\n\n## How the NNS started\nThe idea of the NNS originated from a question:\n \n*“Is there a way to transform a meme icon into a fully functional domain, where its utility grows proportionally to the meme adoption?”*\n \nDuring the first months of work, this idea evolved from its very first draft on Prop House, letting the NNS become a possible solution to several interesting scenarios:\n \n* In an ecosystem based on CC0 like the Nouniverse, with a lot of new communities and sub-DAOs, the .⌐◨-◨ could become a universal tool for companies and creators to interact with the entire ecosystem at once.\n***How so?***\nThe power of a CC0 ecosystem is the proliferation of a main idea in many sub-projects and communities. In the Nouniverse, that idea is represented by the ⌐◨-◨ meme. The noggles appear in every nounish community, but at the same time they are part of different NFTs and collections. At the moment, there isn’t a token that can unify the Nouns ecosystem at an infrastructural level. The .⌐◨-◨ can fill this gap, allowing companies and creators to reach the whole ecosystem by simply integrating the NNS into their token-gated experiences and initiatives.\n\n* The more the NNS is integrated on new apps and marketplaces across the world, the more the .⌐◨-◨  will help spread the nounish culture at an exponential level.\n***How so?***\nThe NNS serves as an on-chain identity badge for all the people who share the nounish culture. Having your .⌐◨-◨  attached to your web3 identity makes it clear that you belong to the “nounish internet society”. The more the NNS will expand, the more the Nouns proliferation will reach places that wouldn’t even have been considered before.\n\n* In a market dominated by 2 titan projects and few TLDs, the NNS could become the first experiment of a collaborative naming system on ETH. This would allow other communities to join the NNS and create their own TLD on top of the NNS, making the whole protocol stronger and more widely adopted, and offering the new communities the advantage of having their TLD natively resolved across the NNS network from day 1. \n***How so?***\nOnce the Nouns Name Service is globally recognised by important apps in the space, it could open its network to other communities as well. This way, communities will not only get their customized TLD (that’s nothing new), but this will be able to be natively resolved everywhere from the very beginning. This will literally onboard in the Nouniverse and in Nouns DAO whole communities made by end-users and talented builders, constantly bringing new ideas and improving engagement thanks to a proven system of funding based on Prop House, Small Grants and all the other nounish DAOs.\n\n**In a nutshell,** for a community joining the NNS would mean not only having a naming infrastructure, but also being able to build and nurture important relationships in the Nouniverse that will push new ideas and collaborations with the entire ecosystem.\n\nThese applications, which at the moment represent our focus, will offer Nouns and the Nouniverse an important value in terms of proliferation, new users in existing nounish platforms and the attraction of new builders.\n\nAnd we are confident this is just the beginning of many other applications for the NNS.\n\n[![Nouns-Name-Service-NNS-works.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/CKSxMGqR/Nouns-Name-Service-NNS-works.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/bZVh32LP)\n\n## Roadmap (The 3 Phases)\nBuilding this kind of Naming System is a big task. Which is why we split our development in 3 Phases. After the first one is completed, the NNS will be able to move to the next one, and so on.\n\n### PHASE 1: Core Ecosystem and Community\nThe power of any protocol lies in its network.\nThat’s why our top priority since launch has always been to build a strong core ecosystem from which we can expand.\n\nWhile new naming systems often rely on external plugins to resolve their names, the NNS aims to create a network where every NNS name is natively resolved without any additional action by the users.\n \nAt the time of writing, the NNS has been supported by all the major nounish projects, officially connecting the Nouniverse. \n\n[![Nouns-Name-Service-NNS-projects.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/SNcXyNvt/Nouns-Name-Service-NNS-projects.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/RNVCd99c)\n \n**ENS reservation period and stats:** \n\nDuring the first 60 days after launch NNS names could only be claimed by their correspondent .eth.\n \nWhile this impacted the NNS growth in the very short term, it also allowed the early adopters to have full control of their identities, thus focusing more on identity than speculation.\n\nThe ENS reservation ended on 19 October 2022 with the following results:\n\n* 355 names claimed\n* 252 unique owners\n \nAs you’re reading this, after 4 months of development and 2 months of Reservation Period, Phase 1 is officially completed.\n\nAt this time, 2 weeks after the end of the Reservation Period, a total of 526 .⌐◨-◨  names have been registered from 311 unique owners.\n\n[![nns-launch-artwork.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/KvH4WgjG/nns-launch-artwork.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/mt7bzk7J)\n\n### PHASE 2: Expansion and Nounish Club\n\nPhase 2 will start the real proliferation of the NNS.\n\nAs mentioned in the TL;DR, the Expansion phase will have several goals, starting from the integration of the NNS in new DAOs, apps and marketplaces outside the Nouns ecosystem, also solving the .⌐◨-◨ current copy-paste issue. \n\nPart of the Expansion will also be the building of an NNS Scan, which you can picture like an NNS version of EtherScan. We will also create a new and more complete website, where end-users and developers will be able to access a full documentation so that they can find new ways to integrate the NNS in their projects. \n\nThe NNS Squad will also have access to an experimental Treasury which will be used to reward active members and finance new missions.\n\nFinally, and what we believe is the most exciting part of this Phase, we will launch the Nounish Club project to push proliferation through an experimental form of community reward and participation. \n\nAt the end of these developments, we will start the first experiments and collaborations for Phase 3. \n\n### The Nounish Club \n\nThe Nounish Club is an experiment made to reward nouners, nounish projects and communities outside the Nouniverse through new forms of community participation.\n \nThe idea is to allocate to this initiative all the numbers from 0 to 9999.⌐◨-◨, making them a new coveted asset to stimulate NNS proliferation and inspire new community ideas.\n\nHowever, these numbers won't be available to be bought from the NNS.\n\nThey will only be earnable by taking active part in .⌐◨-◨ proliferation and in special initiatives, and they will be entirely distributed for free through what we like to call a “Proof of Proliferation” process. \n\nThe Nounish Club will be an exclusive group inside the NNS, completely in the hands of the Nouniverse.\n \nEvery nounish project will be able to add a special benefit to the club, such as discounts, NFTs, voting power, early accesses and more. They will also be able to ask the NNS to get a specific allocation of numbers to be shared among their communities or to be used as assets to keep in their treasury.\n \nThe more benefits will be added, the more the access to the Nounish Club will be valued.\n\nHere are some key points of how this would work:\n\n* The NNS will allocate an initial amount of numbers to the NNS Squad DAO created through Nouns Builder. This will add an additional asset to the treasury that will be managed according to DAO voting.\n* For the first 6 months, the numbers from 0 to 669 will be reserved for Nouners. Every existing nouner, as well as new ones, can request their specific numbers offering their help to proliferate the Nouns Name Service or to add benefits to make the Nounish Club more valuable. \n* Specific numbers would be used to invite new strategic users into the Nouns ecosystem.\n* Nounish DAOs and projects would be able to request a certain allocation of numbers for proliferation initiatives. This will make the distribution of the Nounish Club more and more decentralized.\n* If the experimental allocation to the NNS Squad DAO is successful, the NNS will gradually allocate a bigger amount of numbers to the DAO over time. \n\nThe Nounish Club benefits will be grouped on a url like nounishclub.wtf and new proposals about ideas, benefits and allocations can be managed through the NNS Squad DAO and discussed on the NNS Discord.\n\nThe Nounish Club will also use Prophouse as another important tool to generate and reward new ideas.\n\n#### Why the Nounish Club?\n\nWe are exploring what the NNS can become through a continuous loop of never-tried before experiments and feedback. The Nounish Club is one of them.\n\nThe reason we are excited about the Nounish Club is that we believe it can be an interesting experiment which, if successful, will be able to create a massive value for every community in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nThis value can be seen as:\n\n* **Building value:** It will be a further incentive for nounish communities to build cool things for the NNS and the Nounish Club.\n* **Proliferation value:** It will generate a further proliferation of the .⌐◨-◨  and can be used to onboard strategic users into the Nouns ecosystem.\n* **Economic value:** The more the NNS and the Nounish Club will grow, the more every name of the Club will be valuable (incentivizing more building around it).\n\n[![NNSproposal-artwork3.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/90rG85XH/NNSproposal-artwork3.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/hQRzvY72)\n\n### PHASE 3: Protocol\n\nOnce the NNS is supported by the major platforms in the space and successfully completes all the other tasks, it will be ready to open the protocol to other communities.\n \nThis upgrade will allow other great projects to build their TLD on top of the Nouns Name Service.\n \nThis will strengthen the relationship between the Nouniverse and worldwide communities working together for the proliferation of the Nouns Name Service.\n \nDwelling on the developments of Phase 3 is not the focus of this proposal, which aims to focus on the Expansion and Phase 2. However, our ultimate mission is making Nouns the center of a naming revolution that will attract not only end users, but also companies and other big projects.\n \nSome aspects of Phase 3 are still being brainstormed and we can’t wait to share more details with the community when they’ll be ready.\n\n## FUNDS\n\n### Personal context for full transparency from Dom (@dotnouns)\n\nBesides the 2 ETH received from Prop House in April, all the NNS development was bootstrapped.\n\nAs a founder and a true believer in the NNS, since the end of May I decided to commit 90% of my time on the project, gradually reducing the personal clients I was following in my day job.\n \nIf this can seem a hazard to many, burning the bridges that could act as a way out allowed the project to be laser focused on execution and allowed the NNS to become what it is today.\n \nThe goal of this proposal is helping the NNS to build a starting fund that will push the development and the proliferation with the same laser focus that has characterized Phase 1.\n\n### The request in a nutshell\n\nWe are requesting 195 ETH to scale the NNS, fully complete Phase 2 and begin experiments for Phase 3 as well.\n\nFunds will be immediately converted in USDC to avoid volatility of any kind.\n\n### How the funds will be used\n\nThe funding from this proposal will serve to develop the following areas, which will be crucial for the long-term success:\n \n·  \t**Expand the team** and hire top professionals for specific tasks or projects. In particular, main focus will be given to external integrations and community building.\n·  \t**Design a website** that will offer more support to end users and developers. This will include an extensive tech documentation and FAQ section.\n·  \t**Create a DAO for the NNS Squad through Nouns Builder.** The DAO treasury will be used to coordinate proliferation actions among members and to manage the allocation of numbers for the Nounish Club.\n·  \t**Create an NNS House on Prop House** focused on building new products for the NNS ecosystem, the Nounish Club and developing new integrations with important partners.\n·  \t**Push proliferation** in and outside the Nouns ecosystem through the Nounish Club.\n·  \t**Add a new .nouns TLD** that will help overcome .⌐◨-◨ copy-paste problems on external apps, thus making its applications more flexible and effective. \n\n### Thoughts about the .⌐◨-◨  copy-paste “issue”\n\nOne frequent objection about the .⌐◨-◨  is that noggles are not easy to type on the keyboard. This is indisputably true.\n\nThe .⌐◨-◨  is first of all an identity badge of the Nouniverse. That’s why it’s natively resolved on all the nounish platforms without any effort or action by the user.\n\nEven if every tool built around the NNS would make writing the .⌐◨-◨ easy as a click, to expand the applications of the Nouns Name Service we are also exploring the creation of a .nouns TLD.\nThis domain would ease the integration of the NNS in several apps (especially wallets) and would unlock interesting additional applications.\n\nIn the future, NNS users would be able to connect all their NNS names to this core extension and from their dashboard they could decide how they want to appear in their favorite communities.\n\nThis development is still in brainstorming mode, but we wanted to share it to give some context about our initial focus and what we’re going to work on next.\n\n### Milestones and funding release\n\nIn an effort to show our commitment and laser focus in the NNS mission, we decided to divide the funding allocation in 2 tranches.\n\nThe first 97.5 ETH will be unlocked upfront and will cover the first 3 months.\nIn particular, during this period we will: \n\n* Launch and proliferate the Nounish Club project and its DAO\n* Release the new website with a full documentation\n* Complete the first new integrations with projects outside the Nouns ecosystem\n* Start the first experiments with the .nouns extension. (If everything works smoothly we will be able to release it during the first 3 months, otherwise it will be launched in month 4.)\n\nThe list only refers to the goals highlighted in this proposal and doesn't include actions that will be part of the ordinary proliferation strategy of the NNS, such as community initiatives, viral actions and collabs with other projects in and outside the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nAt the end of the first 3 months, these milestones will be checked and verified by nouns community members Toady Hawk and Benbodhi.\n\nIf this first Milestone Check is successful, the second and last part of the funding will be released.\n\n### Multisig Wallet\n\nFunds will be managed through a Gnosis multisig wallet (2/3) with the following trusted signers:\n\n* [Dotnouns](https://twitter.com/dotnouns) (NNS)\n* [Toady Hawk](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/toadyhawk.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8) (Proposal Sponsor and Milestones Checker)\n* [Benbodhi](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/benbodhi.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8) (Milestone Checker)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis is what the Nouns Name Service is right now, and what it could become.\n\nWe realize it’s an ambitious vision, and that there might be challenges and many things we didn’t predict, as for every venture in unexplored waters. \n\nHowever, ever since the beginning, we’ve tried to earn the community’s trust. We are now fully committing ourselves to something that could be extremely beneficial for the Nouns ecosystem in the long term.\n\n**If you believe in this project, we ask you to consider supporting this proposal, so that we can together build the future of the Nouns Name Service!**\n\n"},{"blockNumber":15970714,"blockHash":"0xee44c2b6876db0cd3821bd0e680f44440c3e09a443427eee98e7f779143381fa","transactionIndex":55,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xadd05fe7e772f85a6feb48c0adaa64734cf828f6b1718d8c63c5abb25b31ed20","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":171,"proposer":"0x36A5Bc205DF1ED65C86301022cfc343a6ce546ff","targets":["0xf0FCB01E1B130a9B7AeD2d798A5877648D3ED517"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":15985114,"endBlock":16021114,"description":"# DCS Pod\n\n## tl;dr ##\nDCS is a pod that focuses on bridging the gap between existing off-chain funding options and larger on-chain props. Focused primarily on the sectors of software, arts and IRL with a funding range between 8-25Ξ, our goal is to help builders with a track record scale up within the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n## Overview ##\n\nThere currently exists a large gap within the current Nouns funding landscape that creates challenges for Nounish builders in the ecosystem. \n\nOn the lower end of the spectrum, there are many options for builders to seek funding for <10Ξ, between NSFW, Prop House, and a number of subDAO efforts (Gnars, SharkDAO, Lil Nouns, etc). On the higher end, there is virtually no limit as we have seen on-chain props go to $1M and beyond.\n\nHowever, in between these two points there is a gap that continues to grow as we see NSFW, Prop House, and subDAOs prefering to run more experiments with smaller amounts, all the while prominent Nouners are increasingly calling for the DAO to scale upward and not consider on-chain props lower than 20Ξ.\n\nThis places builders in a tough spot where they must figure out how to take their concept from point A to point B to achieve escape velocity. This issue is further exacerbated by the closure of the official Nouns Discord server, which will make it harder for the DAO to reach consensus on on-chain props as a governing body.\n\nDCS will focus on working with these builders who have \"graduated\" from one of the off-chain funding programs and provide them with bridge funding and guidance as they work towards the goal of passing a larger scale on-chain prop with the broader DAO base.\n\nSaid a different way, we help builders **Do Cool Sh*t**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pMkWTM2.png)\n\n## Pod Details ##\n\nDCS pod members will leverage their Nounish network and experience to guide and work with builders to ensure their further success in the DAO. DCS will act as a working group to ensure our funded builders are provided more than just capital but an active group to collaborate with and build alongside.\n\n**The pod plays a key role in four ways:**\n\n- Creates a stepping stone for off-chain \"graduates\" on their journey to larger on-chain props, both in terms of financial support and guidance in refining their project\n- Provides accountability and additional data points for the broader DAO to consider when the resulting props go on-chain\n- Emphasizes a transparent decision making framework that is data-driven and scalable\n- Actively works with builders to ensure their further success in the DAO by being a source of active support and guidance helping them move through the roadblocks and challenges they face\n\n**What areas will the pod focus on?**\n\nDCS will focus on key areas where we feel we can provide the most value and help ideas scale quickly. Given the subject matter expertise and experience of pod members, the following areas are our initial focus: \n\n- **Software** - dApps, smart contracts, mobile apps, gaming\n- **Arts & Content** - artists, musicians, video and content creators\n- **IRL** - local/regional activations, events, and other on-the-ground efforts\n\n\n**How will the group operate?**\n\n- Props (sourced from off-chain funding programs) will be be submitted to the pod online\n- Prop will be discussed on weekly DCS calls\n- Prop will be voted on in the DCS Discord\n\nWe will work with the operators of the various off-chain funding program to raise visibility for DCS as a \"next step\" for graduates. We will use Prop House and/or [AddressBoard](https://www.addressform.io/) to receive formal funding requests, so we can ensure proper data collection throughout the process for the DAO.\n\nThe pod will convene once a week on an open call to discuss what has been submitted since the last meeting and to discuss additional pipeline developments. These calls will be available to the community. This will foster discussion about props, help engage with builders and elevate the quality of props that get funded. Emphasis will be placed on data-driven processes to ensure greater builder accountability and proper measurement of ROI back to the DAO.\n\nAfter discussion, pod members will decide which props will be funded by voting on a dedicated Discord channel (or via Prop House platform).\n\nPod members are required to attend weekly meetings and actively give feedback on props. Pod members can be removed and replaced based on participation (which will be decided by the remaining members of the pod). Pod members will be rotated every 3-6 months in order to spread knowledge, boost decentralization and to ensure the pod is not overly reliant on any single member.

As soon as the rest of the USDC is available, it is sent to the recipient's wallet, no user intervention needed. We expect this to take a few days at most, depending on the total amount.\n\nTokenBuyer allows anyone to swap USDC for the ETH it holds. It uses Chainlink's ETH/USD price feed to set the price.\n\nWhenever a proposal requests USDC from the DAO, it will also include a transaction to top up TokenBuyer with additional ETH, proportional to the USDC amount requested.\n\n(*This \"automatic top-off\" is part of nouns.wtf; other governance clients can choose whether they implement this behavior*)\n\n### Example:\n* Builder A creates a proposal that requests 100,000 USDC\n* 2 actions will be added to the proposal:\n    1. Send 100K USDC from the TokenBuyer to Builder A\n    2. Send $150K worth of ETH to TokenBuyer to swap for USDC\n       * The extra $50K (50% buffer) is added in case ETH price goes down\n       * If TokenBuyer already holds ETH, then it will be sent less ETH accordingly\n* When the proposal executes:\n    1. 100K USDC it sent to Builder A\n        * If TokenBuyer has less than 100K USDC on hand, a debt will be registered towards Builder A\n    3. TokenBuyer will swap ETH for 100K USDC\n    4. Any remaining USDC debt to Builder A is paid as soon as it is swapped\n\n### UI preview\n\nThis is a preview of a new proposal creation flow for nouns.wtf developed by Brian.\nIt will go live once it's possible to request USDC.\n\n![proposal_ui_1](https://i.imgur.com/cOqFO3V.png)\n![proposal_ui_2](https://i.imgur.com/vZNqCJ7.png)\n\n### Parameters\n\n* `baselinePaymentTokenAmount`: amount of USDC to hold \"on hand\". Currently set to $500,000.\n* `botDiscountBPs`: a price discount to incentivize anyone (probably bots) to swap USDC for ETH. Currently set to 10 bps (0.1%).\n\n### Admin access\n* The tech pod & the DAO have an \"operator\" privilege with permissions to:\n    * Modify `baselinePaymentTokenAmount`, allowed range is: 0 - $1M\n    * Modify `botDiscountBPs`, allowed range is: 0-150 (0-1.5%)\n    * Pause TokenBuyer swaps\n    * Withdraw ETH from TokenBuyer and send it to the DAO\n    * Change the operator\n* Only the DAO has the ability to:\n    * Send USDC\n    * Change the allowed ranges for `baselinePaymentTokenAmount` and `botDiscountBPs`\n\n### Arbitrage bot\n* A reference bot has been developed and [open-sourced](https://github.com/solimander/eth-buyer-arbitrage-bot) by solimander. We encourage anyone to run their own bot or improve on the code\n* The tech pod will be running the reference bot at the beginning to bootstrap the system\n* Anyone can perform swaps against TokenBuyer. If we see low activity, we will increase the `botDiscountBPs` parameters to increase the incentive (e.g. if gas prices become high).\n\n## Auditing and Testing\n\n* The smart contracts were audited by yAcademy. [Audit report](https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer/blob/166ec30ecd5dada8e17b55317ce3823d4c36b35f/audit/yAcademy_NounsDAO_TokenBuyer_review.pdf)\n    * No \"critical\" issues were found\n    * 1 \"high\" and 1 \"medium\" issues were found. The \"high\" issue was fixed, and the \"medium\" issue was acknowledged as not being an issue for us.\n* Prior to this proposal a few rounds of funding and spending using Token Buyer were done on mainnet\n\n\n## Funding\n* Assuming `baselinePaymentTokenAmount` is set to $500K, we would want to fund TokenBuyer with enough ETH to swap for $500K. We suggested adding an extra 50% to account for price changes. At current ETH prices this 750,000 / 1200 = 625 ETH\n* The initial ETH amount will be sent to the tech pod multisig\n* The tech pod will deploy it into TokenBuyer in chunks while monitoring that it performs correctly\n\n---\n\nIncluded Transactions:\n\n* Send 625 ETH to: `0x79095391743e0f017A16c388De6a6a3f175a5cD5` (Tech Pod Multisig)"},{"blockNumber":15991498,"blockHash":"0xc8d0f10316f099c9a5c74552830beff746535183adae39639f8474799574cf03","transactionIndex":154,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x739a5b224f55d4c531505ee1718a9817125641113aa325553ddd32feb7221fc2","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":173,"proposer":"0xc2d4f2D86E9fF3415C7e0C3Ee44C8819D25Fe413","targets":["0xAC2671bAaA44b79cA1Fb006750c684E5349d721b"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":16005898,"endBlock":16041898,"description":"# Sail Nouns in the New York Harbor for NFT.NYC 2023\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PHkFAtJ.jpg)\n\n### TL;DR\n - Fleet of seven J/24 sailboats with Nounish sails and one bigger sailboat\n - Photo and video opportunities in front of Manhattan, Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty\n - 100 guests onboard will actively participate by steering boats and trimming sails \n - Post-event meetup at the Manhattan Yacht Club’s clubhouse\n\n# Description\n\n### Why Sailing?\nI ([fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)) have been sailing for 11 years and recently combined my passion for sailing and love of Nouns by organizing a regatta through Seoul (funded by [Prop 102](https://nouns.wtf/vote/102)). Sailing is one of the most prestigious sports and often gets attention of the media, guests, and residents. It's enjoyable to participate in, to watch live, and creates beautiful images and video to share.\n\n\n### Nouns in the New York Harbor\nNFT.NYC is only four months away. Most likely NFT and web3 projects are going to run the same promotions with posters and billboards. *Why not make something different?*\n\nFollowing the success of [Prop 102](https://nouns.wtf/vote/102), I would like to organize a sailing event on April 9th in New York with help of Manhattan Yacht Club. The NFT.NYC sailing event is going to be order of magnitute larger to match the gravity of the legendary New York.\n\n\nI will put together a fleet of seven J/24 sailboats and one bigger sailboat in New York bay with Nounish sails. We are going to invite Nounish people and sail together from New Jersey to Manhattan, Brooklyn Bridge, and the Statue of Liberty.\n\nWe'll be using J/24 sailboats for this event because it is the world's most popular one-design keelboat. It is a classic Porsche of sailing and respected by all sailors. It is easy to sail and looks beautiful when you get up the Nounish spinnakers.\n\n\n### Interactive Community Building\nThe plan is to make teams of 3 experienced sailors and 3-4 guests for each boat. The guests will be able to actively participate by steering boats and trimming sails. We are going to use one bigger boat to accomodate all guests and swap guests on boats near the Statue Of Liberty so all the guests can get full experience. 100 people will be invited, with priority to for the Nouns community. 20 invitations will be sent to special NFT.NYC attendees (media, artists, etc.) \n\nIt is going to be unforgettable experience. Later, we can gather together at Manhattan Yacht Club's clubhouse and share a few beers.\n\nLet's enjoy early spring sailing in NYC together and use this unique opportunity as a team building and proliferating event. A lot of New Yorkers and visitors are going to see Nouns logos during NFT.NYC and posted on social networks.\n\n### Documentation\nAll events/locations before and during the event will be documented and all media will be regularly shared with the [nounish ⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/nounish) team and posted on social networks.\n\n----\n# Details\n\n### Event map\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ysZx8iI.png)\n\n### Nouns branded sail designs\n![](https://i.imgur.com/S7SfqsE.jpg)\n\nBased on sail inventory availabe at Manhattan Yacht Club, it would be best to buy both mainsail and spinnaker sails. The available at manhattan yacht club sails have mount gay rum logos and wouldn't look good during our photo ops.\n\nDiscussions on sail designs and upcomming events will be posted on twitter and nounish discord.\n\nAfter NFT.NYC, the sails will be shipped and stored in my yacht club, in korea for possible future Nounish events.\n\nThere are four different design options availbe\n1) same color fabric, red noggles\n2) same color fabric, different color noggles\n3) different color fabrick, red noggles\n4) different color fabric, different color noggles\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Jiz8Rn0.png)\n\nIMO most of the beautiful thing about nouns community is collective hacking, designing, and thinking. I would like to get feedback from community to find best sail designs. \n\n\n----\n# Budget\n### Nouns NFT.NYC sailing photo op & team building\nWe going to invite as many people as possible, starting with Nounish folks. The event would be a best way to proliferate Nouns and organize a team building event for Nounish people.\n- **$24,000** Chartering fees for 7+ boats at Manhattan Yacht Club\n    - I received quote of $3,800 per boat for a general public\n    - The price might go down after I send an official request from my yacht club\n- **$35,000** Nouns sails inventory for 7+ boats\n    - (branded spinnakers and mainsails)\n    - I wil keep all the sails safe for future possible events. For example, NFT.NYC sailing event in 2024!\n- **$10,000** Small travel grants for sailing teams comming from Seattle, San Francisco, Texas, Michigan, Maryland.\n    - We need experienced crew to operate sailboats.\n    - The plan is to make teams of 3 pro sailors and 3-4 guests per one boat\n- **$15,000** Safety and media motor boats etc\n    - It is very important to have a couple motor boats available for media or in the case of emergency\n- **$5,000** The big boat is going to accomodate more guests. Later, on the way back from the Statue Of Liberty, we aregoing to swap guests and give more people chance to experience J/24 sailing.\n    - NFT.NYC is a big event and we might want to invite a lot of interesting people to the Nouns sailing event\n    - Also, some parts of New York bay is no fly zone for drones so it would be best to put a few photographers on a bigger boat\n- **$15,000** photo/video team\n- **$5,000** Nouns branded t-shirts and caps to look like a true team (120 pcs)\n- **$5,000** BBQ, beers, and rum for after party at Manhattan Yacht Club\n- **$21,000** expenses for operations team including me; $7k per person (I will need at least two reliable people with sailing experience with me to organize 7+ sailboats, photo ops, coordinate everyone etc; getting ready venue and boats 2 days before the event; 2 days cleaning boats and packing everything after the event)\n- **$15,000** budget for unexpected expenses and price offset (we can use some money to make invitations, rent more sailboats, buy more sails, stickers for boats, add more safety measures, shipping or storage for sails after the event etc)\n- **$10,000** I would like to request a small compensation for my efforts to plan the event for next 3 months.\n\n**Total: $160,000 or ~134 ETH (1 ETH = $1,200)**\n\nWe are asking for $160,000.

Conveying a good idea in a way that voters can understand and relate to is even more difficult.  With the increased number of proposals and ideas coming in weekly, it’s more important than ever to effectively communicate one's idea and value proposition.  For some builders, proposal writing may not be a core strength. So their proposals may fail on-chain, even if the core concept is valuable.\n    \n2. **Effective Communication with DAO Voters is Difficult**\n    \n    One of the most difficult challenges for builders in the Nouns ecosystem has always been figuring out how to have open dialog with voting Nouners and Delegates. These challenges will only increase as the DAO grows. Now, with the Official Nouns Discord closed, this is an even more pressing issue. \n    \n3. **Constructive and Honest Feedback is Rare**\n    \n    Very few people within Nouns are giving truly honest and constructive criticism to proposals that need work. Discourse and Nouncil feedback sometimes can be “soft”, as people may not want to publicly discuss the potential pitfalls of a fellow community member’s idea or hurt their feelings.  We see this occurring more frequently with on-chain proposals, and it doesn’t help anyone in the long run.\n\n\n\n[![boxbrain.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/14xN6w0Y/boxbrain.gif)](https://postimg.cc/wRVvYtGh)*Think INSIDE the box!*\n\n\n# Our Solutions\n\n**PropBox will aim to solve the above pain points in the following ways:**\n\n1. Ugly Dao has a talented roster of builders, many of whom have experience writing successful proposals for Prop House, NSFW and on-chain. We also have professionals with experience in the legal, marketing, education, and communications fields. With our combined training and experience, we can help builders create proposals that make an impact. Additionally, sometimes the most difficult part of seeking funding from Nouns is **knowing where to go.** We can help proposers understand if their idea is best suited to a Prop House round, an NSFW pitch, a discussion with the newly minted DCS Pod, or a full on-chain proposal. Finally, we believe that proposals should lean on multimedia content to achieve maximum impact in an attention-scarce environment. We want to help builders integrate engaging videos and visuals into their proposals.\n\n2. We know the Nouns community like the back of our Ugly hand, and can help new builders navigate the difficult task of amplifying the message of their proposal. From appearances on The Noun Square, discussions in Nouncil or other Nounish discords, as well as conversations on Twitter, Discourse, House of Nouns and elsewhere, we know how to help builders with the most difficult part of getting funded for a proposal: **Communicating directly with the people who ultimately will vote yes or no.** \n\n3. The DAO needs more well-intentioned people who are not afraid to give would-be builders The Ugly Truth, and we are prepared to do so.\n\n\n# The PropBox Value Prop\n\nOur goal is to become the premier resource to help builders create great proposals and find pathways to funding in the Nouns ecosystem. We plan to find and incubate teams and projects from multiple sources, including:\n\n- Current builders in the ecosystem who are looking for feedback and help navigating the proposal process.\n- New builders who need extra help onboarding into Nouns, writing proposals, and making the right connections to be successful.\n- “Uncut gems” from Prop House and Discourse to fund proof of concept projects and prepare the teams for potential larger on-chain proposals in the future. We aim to find builders with the highest potential and help them fulfill that potential. Ideas from this category should have at least 10x potential from the amount of initial funding.\n\n# The Origin Story\n\nThis project began as an initiative by [Andrew ](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/andrewladdusaw.eth)[Laddusaw](https://twitter.com/AndrewLaddusaw), through [Nouncil](https://discord.gg/nouncil), following the [Combinator Round in Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round:-25-eth) back in July (aka “the before times.”) Andrew saw a lot of talented teams that submitted great proposals, but of course the round only had one winner for the 25ETH prize. \n\nHe began contacting builders and building a system within Nouncil Discord to give these teams feedback to prepare them for an on-chain proposal, or to help them secure alternative funding sources. When they began reviewing proposals publicly as a group, other builders asked for help as well.\n\nDuring this initial trial, the Incubator team gave feedback to 9 proposals. Through that process: One secured funding through NSFW. One pursued another Prop House to fund a proof of concept, won, and later joined Nouncil. One ended up abandoning the initial idea, but moved on to other projects during the incubation process, and has now been funded for multiple other projects within the DAO (shout out [ripe0x](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/ripe0x.eth).) Two other proposals ended up with on-chain votes, one narrowly being defeated and one securing funding for 40 ETH (Prop 144 for One Click Bots). \n\n[![andre-testimonial.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/JnndSt6P/andre-testimonial.gif)](https://vimeo.com/774010662/b852cb4533)\n*Click to watch a 2 minute PropBox testimonial video from Andrei (BotFrens)*\n\nWe learned a lot through this experiment. We’re continuing to follow up with the builders as they hone their ideas, and expect to see even more fruit from these efforts in the coming months. We’re also continuing to improve our feedback process and we believe we’re ready for the next phase of growth.\n\n\n# The Timeline\n\n**This proposal will support the PropBox team for a 3 month period to do the following:**\n\n- Actively locate builders in the ecosystem to help drive their ideas forward and guide them through the proposal process that is most appropriate to their ideas and building stage.\n- Create an active Builder’s Guild in the PropBox Discord, where those who are creating tools and proposals can do so in the open, and together. This well help create consistent startup energy in the Nouns community.\n- Review every Discourse, and various Discord community posts, making sure everyone submitting proposal ideas gets quality feedback and the best possible Nouns experience when they first arrive in the community. One of our greatest desires is that new, talented builders would not leave the community discouraged after getting negative feedback, simply because they didn’t understand the funding process or the culture of what it means to be a part of Nouns.\n- Create a website to house a toolkit of templates, best practices, tips and tricks, and contact information giving builders a toolbox to maximize success.\n- We will also spend the next three months exploring several ideas, which we will present to the community at the end of the proposal funding period:\n    - *How to potentially make an incubator like this self-sustaining in the future.*\n    - *A system to temperature check proposals and gather feedback from as many sources as possible, including from those with the most likelihood to swing vote outcomes.*\n    - *How to create efficiencies in the proposal process, so that new community members can transition from their first interactions to building as effectively as possible within the DAO.*\n    - *Exploring systems of trust-building to make sure that scammers are not able to abuse the treasury through gaming or fraud.*\n    - *Decisions about what form this group should take in the future; how to incorporate new members, ideas, and processes to maintain the highest degree of quality feedback, help, and value to the DAO.*\n\n\nAll of the above is to serve the ultimate goals of PropBox: \n\n**To help builders write high quality proposals, and to make decision-making simpler and less time-consuming for DAO members.**\n\n# The Budget\n\n**75ETH** **Total**\n\n- **60 ETH** - In our trial, we were able to achieve a great deal of success with people who were just volunteering their time. We know that with DAO funding, we will have much more capacity to onboard talented builders and incubate many more proposals. \n    - **20 ETH** per month as a payment to team members, to be paid retroactively based on work completed and builders helped. This work will include engaging builders at every stage of the proposal process, guiding them, and helping to write effective and media-rich proposals. These team rewards will be distributed via biweekly Coordinape rounds (Nouncil model.) All payment data will be publicly available to the DAO. \n    - Our team goal will be to engage with a minimum of 30 builders about their proposals over the course of a 3 month period. \n    \n- **10 ETH** for a pool to fund some small projects, as an experiment in additional targeted flexible funding for the DAO: Taking small ideas that we encounter through the process of our work and helping those teams to execute small ideas or create MVPs of larger ones. \n- **5 ETH** of retro funding for what has been done to build this system already.\n\n# The PropBox Team\n\nWe are a group of Nounish builders that have created and executed successful proposals at every funding level. We are consistently active in Discourse, offering constructive feedback and working privately with builders to help them formulate effective proposals and seek funding. We are passionate about great ideas, effective communication, and robust proposals that drive the nounish meme forward. ⌐◨-◨\n\n[![propbox-group-shot-smaller.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qvQ8CwwZ/propbox-group-shot-smaller.png)](https://postimg.cc/ZWB9Gr1r)\n\n- ***Lead: [Andrew Laddusaw](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/andrewladdusaw.eth)***\n- ***Core Team:***\n***[BradQ](https://twitter.com/iambradq)***\n***[ProfWerder](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/profwerder.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)***\n***[SuperTightWoody](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/supertight.eth)***\n***[Toady Hawk](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/toadyhawk.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)***\n\n***Support: Other UglyDAO Members***\n*18 super builders and counting with diverse skills and talents who are passionate ambassadors for Nouns inside and outside of the community*\n\n**Multisig:**\n*Funds will be transferred to and held in a 3/5 Gnosis Safe (propboxvault.eth) with the 5 trusted Nouns community members above.*\n\n# The Bottom Line\n\nWe believe the DAO needs to attract more awesome builders, and needs teams of diligent people finding good ideas and helping them to bloom into full-fledged, effective Nounish initatives. \n\nWe are uniquely qualified to help these builders write awesome proposals, strategize ideal funding paths, and facilitate DAO communications, and we are asking for a mandate to do exactly that. \n\n## Think INSIDE the Box, vote YES for Prop 175!

We have seen full of delightful contest submissions with all sorts of genres from all across the world.\n\nI took an initiative to build a website where we can display all of the entries from NounsDAO's contestants because I personally feel it is very important for the DAO to do so. Additionally, it provides access to all future possibilities. \n\nAs time passes, I feel it needs to grow even more by including all of the Nouns projects from the community and not only the contestants. Our memes proliferations are all contained inside.\n\nWhy is it important to document and archive these things?\n\n> \"The body continuously explores time and space. It holds our history, if we listen closely.\" -Chloe Chotrani\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aDIU2rB.jpg)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n* **Long-term Vision** ; \n    * To retain past and future historical key data of all talented builders & artists that contribute around Nouns ecosystem.\n\n* **Objective** ; \n    * 1) To help **onboard newcomers** that are interested in Nouns so they can catch a **glimpse** of what the project is all about. Navigation will be improved through enhanced visual design to create a stronger first impression.\n    * 2) **References that act as inspiration**. Drawing from references is beneficial because it provides our imaginations with tangible things to model after.\n    * 3) To create potential opportunity for artists / builders to receive **commissions or collaborative works/projects** with others.\n\n* **Strategy** ; \n    * 1) **Simplified TL;DR / streamlined landing page with upgraded visuals** consists of ; *to browse relevant areas & specific parameters* ;\n            * simplified projects/contests brief\n            * project owner/hosts\n            * total funded/prizes\n            * categories (*ex; art, community, tech, marketing, physical etc*)\n            * links to discourse/full props/related infos/contests\n            * social media (*ex; twitter, discord*)\n            * tags / filters *(most recent, oldest, alphabetically)*\n            * distinct project images with descriptions\n            * status\n            * contest winners\n            * CC0 label together with proof of CC0 (*ex; toggle/submit forms etc*)\n            * search bar with data points\n            *( all are shown under **Details**)*\n\n    * 2) **Coordinate with other existing platforms** already in place (ex. ***[nouns.center](https://nouns.center/), [proposal.wtf](https://maty-eth.notion.site/maty-eth/NounsDAO-Proposals-Overview-b8c76e6ac8e44515966ee032ea20f860), [nounish](https://twitter.com/nounish)***) by pooling resources & efforts for maximum efficiency and also to complement each other.\n    * 3) **Contents sustainability** ; we will be using Notion for the database and will be publically viewable. Content submission form with formats will be available for community use. An additional idea is to work with Nouns AI team for data scraping by using certain hashtags/keywords *(to be discuss)*.\n    * 4) **CC0 Contents & Icon** ; any artist can **enable or declare** their work to be CC0 by submitting forms that will be made available soon. It is freely usable by anyone for remixing and other creative purposes.

Recent events have highlighted the dire need and importance of such work. This prop proposes to fund 100 ETH to their donation address: zachxbt.eth (address can be verified from their twitter profile).\n\nDonations have always been somewhat controversial within Nouns governance. [Prop 21](https://nouns.wtf/vote/21) donating 169 ETH to Gitcoin grants was one of the most contentious votes in our early history. [Prop 108](https://nouns.wtf/vote/108) donating 500 ETH to Ethereum protocol development (via the Protocol Guild) was much more unanimous but still there was discomfort and discourse around whether the DAO was becoming \"a tax inefficient way for DAO members to make donations.\" \n\nI agree that we shouldn't resort to becoming a complacent vehicle of passive philanthropy. We should instead aim to actively contribute and be a net producer of public goods ourselves such that our meme (brand) can fully capture the provenance value (claim on originality of) the public work and thus leverage the virtuous cycle to do more than what capital alone could have done. However, there should be exceptions to this rule if there is an urgent and common public cause that warrants highlighting. I would like to suggest that this is such a case. Crypto needs more validators like ZachXBT.\n\nWith donations we need to be extra wary of conflicts of interest or self-dealing. Unfortunately there is no way to prove this cryptographically, but I attest that I have no prior (or planned future) relationship with ZachXBT and that today was the first time I contacted them (via twitter) to ask for their permission to make this proposal.

The only place we actively incentivize them with ideas and funding is Prop House mandated rounds, which are retroactive, leaving builders who lose the round uncompensated for their work. Otherwise, they must figure out problems themselves and then ask for money, a difficult process if someone has no connections to the ecosystem.\n\n**Solution:** Create a program to actively recruit new talented builders and pro-actively fund them to explore the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n### TL;DR\n* 1 grant = 10 ETH for 2 months of exploration, goal for each builder is to have an on-chain prop by end of the period\n* 5 builders (50 ETH total) in first trial run\n* 3 members on operations team (mrtn, jihad, dot), lightly compensated; 2 more on multi-sig (yitong and krel)\n* Transparency is key\n\n### Eligibility\n- Must NOT be actively or recently funded by Nouns, or clearly an existing participant in the Nouns ecosystem\n- Must be new to the broader Nouns ecosystem\n- Must be working / actively exploring _something_ directly related to NounsDAO while on grant, or it will be revoked\n- Preference for people who can proactively create independently — particularly engineers, but also content creators, designers, writers, etc\n\n### Operation Details\nThe entire process will be transparent via a public Discord and run by the 3-person team, who will be lightly compensated to do this work, ensuring accountability and commitment. Our initial proposal had no funding for the team, but we were recommended otherwise by Nouners.\n\n**Public Application:**\n* Explorer Grants will be publicized via Twitter, 1:1 outreach from the team and its network, Twitter Spaces with Nouns community organizations, Discords, etc\n* Candidates will submit public applications, showing past work and motivations for exploring the Nouns ecosystem, as well as a couple problem spaces that interest them\n  * These applications will also benefit the community at large who can recruit builders from this group\n* Candidates will largely be assessed on talent, potential, and excitement about Nouns. Reasoning for accepted candidates will be made public. The 3-person team will decide on 4 final candidates to accept.\n* 1 slot in the program will be allocated to a Nouns community vote\n\n**Program:**\n* 10 ETH for 2 months of part-time exploration for each builder\n  * *Detail: Overpaying slightly is critical to attracting talent that may not otherwise come to us. We are targeting people who make more than $150,000 a year in their full-time job*\n* Weekly check-in call with builders. Members of the Explorer Grants team will help them explore ideas, connect them to Nouners and builders, and lead workshops\n* **End of Program Objective:** each builder submits an on-chain or Prop House prop for continued funding\n\n### Team\n* **mrtn, lead organizer:**\n    * Previously a PM at Google and NBA Top Shot, he has now contributed to a variety of Nounish projects - Nouns Builder, AI Pod, Agora, as well as doing a 24 Hour Nounish live stream, and receiving a Governance Historian grant. At USC, he ran an organization that guided students towards entrepreneurship, whose members include several YC startups. He's a big believer in diversifying funding sources for Nouns builders, and experimenting with the patronage model. *Comp: 3 ETH / month*\n* **jihad, community & product expert:**\n    * Core contributor at Forefront, creating media and building infrastructure for tokenized communities. He is also a delegate and “Lil Nouncilor” at Lil Nouns DAO, a contributor to Public Nouns, one of the winners of the recent Nouns Agora delegate race, and is part of the team building [Adjectives](nouns.terminal.co), an analytics and proposal evaluation platform for Nouns DAO. Jihad believes that Nouns must be a center of excellence for tokenized communities, and the Explorer Grants program would be a step in the right direction in attracting the brightest minds to do focused yet unstructured work in the Nouns ecosystem. *Comp 2 ETH / month*\n* **dot, technical expert:**\n    * Dot is an iOS dev turned nounish builder - a founding member of Nouncil and most recently Lil Nounder at Lil Nouns DAO; the first full fork of Nouns DAO. Dot started Lil Nouns as a way to expose nouns to as many people as possible. Lil Nouns DAO leverages its 8 nouns alongside its own treasury to fund and support public goods built by lil nouners. In doing so, Lil Nouns has become a builder onramp to Nouns DAO itself. *Comp: 2 ETH / month*\n\n***We will use a 3 of 5 multi-sig, with the core team members as well as krel and yitong.***\n\n### Questions\n**How will you actually find these builders?** Our team has fairly deep networks within the crypto and broader tech space; we'll leverage our personal connections as well as our social media presence to find more builders. Additionally, a large appeal of programs like these (Thiel Fellowship, Prop House, MacArthur Grants) is the benefit of continued funding + prestige, which we intend to lean into.\n\n**But what if the builders don't do anything?** This is similar to everything in Nouns already - there's a social contract to uphold, someone could always dissapear after receiving 200 ETH on-chain. We can setup the grant via Sablier to revoke if a builder goes MIA, however.\n\n**What will they actually build?** The first round will not have a particular mandate but future ones could be structured closer to Prop House mandated rounds, where there is a theme. We believe that time and freedom is key to allowing talented builders to find something meaningful to build long-term.\n\n**Why not just run this on Prop House?** Decisions are not always best made by large committees. Prop House rounds do not allow for deep conversation and analysis of candidates. A transparent, small committee allows for depth and betting on candidates who might not otherwise get a shot (i.e. people who aren't good at writing a description on prop house but would be amazing builders). Additionally, we'd like to create a long-term relationship with these builders via an organized cohort.\n\n**What if no good work comes out of this?** That's a possibility, as is the case with prop house rounds. However, we believe that Nouns already has a great enough brand to attract solid builders. However, if nothing goods comes out of this trial, then we will have learned that pro-active grants for attracting builders is not a valid technique for our DAO. If there are takeaways, they can be adapted into other funding sources, like Prop House or NSFW in the future.\n\n**Why are you being paid?** Our initial proposal did not include payment for the team, but it was suggested by Nouners that we should be getting paid to create accountability, as well as allow us to dedicate more time in making this more of a full-fledged program than one-off grants with no support from us.\n\n### Total Funding\n5 Builders x 10 ETH = 50 ETH\nTeam Comp: 14 ETH\nTotal: 64 ETH\n\n***Questions?

It’s like Adult Swim on a dozen espresso shots, in one-minute-or-less episodes, released as 1/1 NFTs.\n\nThis is an opportunity to expand Nouns DAO culture by unleashing highly visible artist-created, community-developed CC0 video content that can be distributed everywhere. It’s also a brand-new way to use web3 tooling to release episodic videos, and an opportunity to pioneer a decentralized media production model that can help inform the future of entertainment. \n**takes a breath*\n\nRead on and watch the below video to learn more.\n\n[![Worst Case Decision](https://cdn.hashku.com/wcd/Nouns_WCD_Pitch_vid_screenshot_1500x.jpg)\n](https://vimeo.com/772223496/a53f2e2dad \"Worst Case Decision\")\n\n\n## What’s Worst Case Decision?\nWorst Case Decision is maybe the first episodic “show” to be released as an NFT series.\n\nEach season of WCD features 7 bite-sized fever dreams that are handcrafted into 30-70 second “episodes.” Every episode chases surreal characters along a bat-shit hyper-casual narrative that loosely follows a theme. So far we’ve explored themes such as “mayonnaise portal,” “everyone is wet,” “hi-fi asparagus rain,” and “too many cats,” to name a few.\n\nThe show’s vibe feels like surfing in a sea of technicolor absurdity, with a low-fi, internet-infused, stop-motion animation style. Video, painting, web3, DALL-E, comedy, commerce… WCD has it all. (Scroll to the bottom of this proposal to view sample episodes.)\n\n**Worst Case Decision Quick Facts:**\n\n* 50 Seasons planned, 7 episodes per season (350 episodes total)\n* Episodes released episodically as 1/1 video NFTs via worstcasedecision.com\n* Each season features an ever-changing cast of characters and collaborators\n* NFTs can be purchased with credit card and digital currency (ETH)\n\n## What makes this exciting for Nouns DAO?\nWe’re at the dawn of a new era for entertainment—one that will enable audiences and creators to build sustainable models of cultural production together. As perhaps the first-ever serialized 1/1 NFT video collection, Worst Case Decision is taking a pioneering approach to launching meme-y, weird, funny narrative shorts with and for the communities who believe this kind of art should exist in the world. \n\nBeyond pioneering this new web3-native episodic production model, there are a few specific benefits that Nouners can expect from supporting this project:\n\n**Noun-ified Episodes**\nThe entire season will be built based on decentralized creative direction by opening up key decisions to the Nouners (and in some cases the internet at large, for max visibility). This includes community input/voting on:\n* The “themes” of each episode\n* Protagonists (I’ve got so many weird character ideas, man)\n* Supporting cast (really, so many weird characters)\n* Episode backgrounds\n\n**CC0 Content & Nouns Memes**\nThe Nouns season of WCD will be entirely CC0. This means that anyone can meme the shit out of the entire season, which will be full of Nouns references, noggles, and other inside jokes specific to Nouns’ community, culture, and lore. Cut up and re-mix the episodes however y’all see fit, and post wherever you want.\n\n**Additional Benefits to Nouns DAO**\n\n1)\t**Major marketing and PR exposure.** This is a first-of-its-kind video collection in the NFT space, and there’s “a lot of press to be had.”\n2)\t**WCD is planned for 50 seasons.** Nouns would be the 3rd season of 50, and the first-ever sponsored season—representing an early entry into supporting what could become a historic release.\n3)\t**Introduce Marc’s audience to Nouns.** I’ve been an independent artist for 25 years, and as a result I’m decently well known. I can help bring the fine art world’s attention to Nouns and web3 at large.\n4)\t**Reach non-web3-savvy folks, too.** Our tech partner [Hashku](https://hashku.com) has both crypto-native and custodial credit card minting solutions, meaning that non-crypto folks can participate in NFT auctions.\n\n![](https://cdn.hashku.com/wcd/nouns_pfp_collage%20copy_sm.jpg)\n\nThese are just mere examples of potential Nouns x WCD characters! Glorious, yes? Please feel free to take ‘em and make ‘em [your PFPs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ff52SL1p3PGzdxYtCO7kyA9kpE2N4EAY?usp=share_link). (Shhhh…. there will be plenty more via https://nouns.build/ in the future.) \n\n## What makes this exciting for Collectors?\nI care immensely about my collectors. I want to add value and make the experience as fun and engaging as the episodes themselves. We have an expansive vision and are thrilled to include our collectors along this journey. \n\nIf you are a holder of a WCD episode from any season, you’ll get access to:\n\n* My network via a private discord channel for collectors (a seat on the board so to speak)\n* Input on IRL WCD events\n* Early access to future WCD collabs and projects  \n\n## Marketing & Community Development\nOur philosophy for marketing and PR follows the vision for the project. Simply put: Our weird creative vision and IRL performances are going to cause some really interesting responses, which we’ll engage with using our built-in strengths with social media and PR.\n\n**Marketing Plan**\n\n* **Launch activities** – Our team will produce strategic content and a mix of online and IRL activations to generate as much pre-launch awareness as possible. We have an existing list of interested & interesting media partners to engage here. The web3 PR agency Serotonin is among them.\n*  **High-velocity engagement** – A dedicated Project Ambassador will act as a marketing strategist, online social maestro, and Nouns champion, using multi-channel engagement tactics to build momentum. \n\n* **Partnerships & sponsorships** – I (Marc) have a long history of partnering with brands to co-create projects. We will be bringing on some truly exciting collaborators and sponsors to spread the word even farther.\n\n* **Long-term community growth** – Our desire is to make this project fully self-sustaining. To do this, our goal is to increase the performance of NFT auctions and overall engagement with the series by aggressively growing the WCD community. \n\n* **Transparent success metrics** – We will track and analyze meaningful engagement metrics to keep the community informed on how we’re doing, and to strengthen our marketing approaches overall.\n\n## Open-Sourcing Our Promo Strategy\n\nWe wish to be as transparent as possible with our learnings about marketing and running this project. We’ll create a public document outlining our goals, metrics, successes, and learnings so that our efforts can help future projects and the community at large.\n\n## Project Team\n\nIn addition to an amazing lineup of advisors, our core team currently consists of the following:\n\n**Marc Horowitz** // Creator & Visionary \n**Chris Coy** // Partner & Spiritual Advisor \n**Damien Newman** // Creative Consultant & Power Supporter \n**Matt Casanova** // Builder of Technologies\n**Hashku** // Minting Platform\n\n## Budget\nAnticipated activities and budgets (by phases):\n\n* **Pre-Production** – $9,650\nStudio usage, lighting equipment, episode concepting/ production planning for all 7 episodes, props, backgrounds, art department (hand making all the noggles and weird other props).\n\n* **Production** – $16,875 \nDirector fee, cinematographer/camera operator fee, additional creative direction and shoot crew/collaborators, daily incidentals during shoot (food, grip, etc), and production assistance.\n\n* **Post-Production** – $11,500 \nSound finishing/sfx/sound design, music licensing, editing, smart contract customizations for specific season NFTs, season-specific website costs (video bandwidth and hosting). \n\n* **Promotion of Nouns + WCD Season (Outreach/Marketing/PR)** – $17,475\nSpread the word about the Nouns DAO and its sponsored season of WCD via strategic editorial write ups, podcast appearances, live events, IRL media stunts/performances, and other activations TBD.  See further notes in “Marketing Plan” (above).\n\n\n**Total Budget** ($55,500) + price contingency: **50 ETH** (converted to USDC immediately) \n\n\n## Timeline & Logistics\n\n**Mid-late February, 2023:** Launch the project with unsponsored seasons 1 and 2.\n\n**Mid-January:** Collaborate with the Nouns community. Using voting mechanisms and other means of gathering community input, we will collectively shape WCD season 3.\n\n**Mid-late January:** Once our Nouns season is planned, each episode takes roughly 2 days to film and edit. That brings pre-production, production, and post-production to 3-4 weeks total.\n\n## How NFT Auctions Will Work on worstcasedecision.com\nEach season of WCD video episodes will be dropped over the course of a week (dates will be announced via [@marchorowitz](https://twitter.com/marchorowitz)).\n* Each day at 9am PST a new episode will drop on worstcasedecision.com\n* Each episode will be released as a 1/1 NFT \n* Each NFT’s auction will end at 8:55:59 am PST the following day\n* When one auction closes, the next one drops—and this continues for 7 days in a row, Mon–Sun.\n\n## The Future of WCD and Episodic NFTs\nWe have the team and vision required to evolve WCD into a genre-defining series. Beyond this, we think we’re onto something in regards to how serialized NFTs can be used as a sustainable model to fund the production of some truly weird and great videos—and other creations as well.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more and chatting with Marc and the team personally, please reach out and we’ll have a chat ;)\n\n## Thank you, Nouners!\nIf I get the chance to collaborate with you all, I know we can make something really fun and amazing.

We will hand pick, and noun pill, five of our favorite creators to complete the other 5 shorts.\n\n**The Rules**\n1. The short must be funny.\n2. The short must be 15 seconds.\n3. The short must feature at least one Noun.\n\nProposers will submit a portfolio (or at least one example of previous work) + a 1 sentence creative pitch for their short.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nOnce the 10 shorts are complete we will plan for an entertaining online premiere, looking to collaborate with people in the Nouniverse, creators, and media outlets with established audiences. Then we will upload these to our own branded social media accounts and anywhere else on the internet that will showcase them. We will also provide the video files publically, allowing anyone to use them in future Nounish projects and news.\n\n**Awards**\n\nWe have an additional 20 ETH to award as prizes. We'll experiment with a variety of prizes and allocation methods including token gated Nounish community votes, live celebrity critic votes, and somehow we're going to get Goldy's dog to choose one prize winner. Also included will be a prize specifically for the best CC0 shorts to incentivize creators to release their content CC0.\n\nAll of our these additional prizes will be open to public submissions - artists not selected and funded through Prop House can create their short anyways and have another shot at competing for the prizes.\n\n**Branding**\n\n10 ETH is included to cover basic branding needed for this Prop House round. This could include logos, a simple website, a Nouns Shorts video bumper to play between shorts, etc. We will return any ETH we do not use to the treasury.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Who is Nouns Stories\n**Stoopid Buddy**\n8 time Emmy-winning studio behind Robot Chicken & Nouns Documentary\n\n**Walter Newman**\nSVP at Adult Swim overseeing such shows as Rick & Morty, Robot Chicken, Smiling Friends, Lazor Wulf + Adult Swim shorts.\n\n**Pixel**\n[Goldy's](https://twitter.com/Goldypix) Oscar Shortlisted hybrid production studio are behind [nounish ⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/nounish) and the soon-to-be-released  animated short film \"[The Wizards Hat](https://twitter.com/nouns_stories/status/1570433066900017152?s=20&t=T_vYbAun_YQEsZUlEwfjSA)\" from the original Nouns Stories proposal. \n\n**Joshua Fisher**\nCreative manager, SharkDAO Rep, Ugly Noun, The Nouns Square Foundooor, NounsDAO Buildooor and Nouns narrative advocate.\n\n**Joel Cares**\nCEO of [Lobal Global](https://lobal.global/), video [Director](https://joelcares.net/), founding member of [Nouncil](http://nouncil.wtf/), creator of [Nerman](https://twitter.com/nermanbot).\n\n\n---\n\n## The Future\nSeason 1 is just the beginning.

Nouns X Everybody is more about the process itself (which could be applied to other areas, not just content creation). Additionally, although this proposal pays more to the winning submissions - it is doing so because it requires the team to produce AND distribute without a guarantee of payment. While the number of views are not everything, they do matter, as we can have the highest quality content in the world but it only matters if people see it. \n\nInstead of determining what we think people will want to see, this proposal will instead outline the guidelines in terms of output as well as the minimum result we want achieved in terms of outcome. Leaving it open for anyone to implement their own creative process in order to achieve that result.\n\nBy funding this the proposal we would hope to achieve the goals of:\n\n\n* Having a minimum of 10 pieces of original video content created, each with a minimum of 2k views on YouTube (20k total views minimum but I would expect much much more).\n* Getting new and innovative ideas from both from within and outside of our existing community by allowing them creative control on the output.\n* Bringing people into the Nouniverse as they will need to learn more about Nouns so as to create content which will enable them to win this challenge.\n* Showcase how the various elements of the DAO (see: ‘The Process’) can be combined to create a cohesive process for project implementation.\n* Demonstrating a proposal process that brings benefit to the DAO and rewards creators while not requiring compensation for the proposer. With 86% going to content creators, 12% going to marketing and just 1% going to administration along with 1% earmarked for an independent report on effectiveness of the proposal after 9 months. \n\n\n---\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n# THE BRIEF\n\n**Create a short hype video that either explains or pulls people into the Nouniverse and if your video gets over 2k views on YouTube before April 30th 2023 you could be awarded part of the $200k fund.**\n\nThe **Top 10 Videos** ranked by number of YouTube views that meet the minimum entry requirements below will be put up for a vote where **4 winners** will be selected and awarded **$50k each**.\n\n* Any person or team is free to submit an entry to this challenge. \n* To enter, simply create your video, upload it to YouTube and get people to watch it.\n\n___\n\n_**MINIMUM QUALIFYING CRITERIA**_ \n\n- Has more than 2000 organic views on Youtube by the end of the Submission Period\n- Must meet the brief (i.e. It either ‘explains the Nouns’ or ‘pulls people into the Nouniverse’)\n- Content must be original. While videos may reuse existing content if it is not mostly original it will not qualify.\n- Is positive in nature and is rated PG\n- Must be a video and not a YouTube \"shorts\"\n- Should include ‘#EnterTheNouniverse’ in the description (so we can easily filter submissions)\n\n\n---\n\nComplete creative freedom is given to entrants on how they want to achieve the goal – it can be animated, live footage, a mixture of both or something completely different. Some teams might focus on higher end productions that explains Nouns to people while others might focus on something simple and unique that pulls people into the Nouniverse (i.e. see the different approach[ Coinbase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJ9pNQrz0fA&ab_channel=AnthonyKalamut) had vs other cypto companies during the superbowl in trying to achieve the same result). It is up to the creator to do what they think will work.\n\n\n\n---\n&nbsp;\n\n## SELECTION CRITERIA\n\nThe **Top 8 Videos with the most views on YouTube + 2 Videos chosen by the Selection Committee** will be entered into the Voting Round – where Noun holders will vote for the 4 winners of $50k each.\n\n\n\n* All videos must meet the minimum qualification criteria\n* Selected entries will be free to provide any additional information at this stage to be included in their entry which demonstrates why their content should win (for example, data from other social media platforms like Twitter, TikTok or any other measure of engagement)\n* Selected entries may be asked to provide information to the selection committee proving that their YouTube views were organic that the data has not been manipulated or paid for.\n* A person/team can submit as many entries as they want but only their best entry (which they can choose)  will be selected for the final vote.\n* We are including 2 videos selected by the committee due to the fact that some entries may not be in the Top 10 in terms of views of YouTube but may have merit for nomination through a disproportionate level of engagement on other channels and/or be of exceptional quality or have uploaded their video late in the process but has gained a lot of views in a short time period.\n---\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n# THE PROCESS\n\nIf this proposal is successful, the following process will take place:\n\n\n\n1. **Proposal Passes:** $200k and 25 Eth with be transferred to a multisig controlled by the Multisig. The challenge has officially started.\n2. **Submission Period:** There is a 5 Month window for anyone to create and publish their hype video.\n3. **Create Marketing Dept:** 25 Eth will immediately be used to fund a Prop House Round with 5 Eth being awarded to the 5 best proposals detailing how they will market and find entrants for this project. (see note at bottom)\n4. **Selection Period:** When the submission period has ended on April 30th 2023 there will be a 2 week selection period where the creators of the Top 10 videos will be invited by the Selection Committee to make their submissions. These submissions, including any additional information the creator wants to provide, will be uploaded to a Prop House round by the Selection Committee.The selection committee will be paid 3 eth for administering this.\n5. **Voting Round:** Nouns will have a 1 week voting period to cast their votes for the 4 winning submissions to be awarded $50k each.\n6. **Payment:** Funds will be distributed to the Winners by the Trusted Parties.\n7. **Analysis**: 2 eth will be earmarked for an indpedent evaluation of this proposal after 9 months. To see how effective it was at achieving the stated outcome. \n\n_**Important Note:** If no one meets the minimum qualifying criteria, the Nouns pay nothing (with the exception of the 25 eth used to fund the marketing dept prop house round) and all funds are returned to the Treasury. But for every person or team that does meet the criteria, we have at the very least a piece of original video content with more that 2k views on YouTube._ \n\n\n\n\n** **\n\n**Selection Committee:** The Selection committee will be comprised of 5 independent members of the Noun community, selected by Hindsight, whose job it will be: (a) select the Top 10 videos to be included in the final Noun vote as per the minimum qualifying criteria and the selection criteria above, (b) contact these creators to submit any additional information for the final vote and (c) upload those submissions to a Prop House vote.\n\nThe work of the selection committee is minimal and mostly administrative (checking that views are organic etc) and as such will only require 3 eth (of which I will get none).\n\n_In order to maintain independence and to ensure a fair process members of the selection committee cannot enter a video to the challenge_\n\n\n---\n\n**Stated Goals of this Proposal** \nIf this proposal passes, it success or failure will be measured against meeting the following criteria:\n* The creation of a minimum of 10 pieces of good quality, original content before April 30th\n* A minimum of 100k cumulative organic YouTube views across all content created in persuit of this prize before 9 months of this proposal passing\n___\n\n\n\n**Team** \nReally the point of this prop is that there is no 'team' but for the interest of transparency and to include a section I think should be in all props:\n* Hindsight: I am not a member of any other teams, councils or projects and I do not receive any compensation from any DAO source. I have no conflicts of interest and will not financially benefit from this proposal.\n* My only role will be to be on the multisig and to choose the selection commitee (A role I would be happy to give to someone else if they are suitable and want it!)\n\n\n---\n\n**Transaction Details**\n\n\n\n* 30 Eth will be transferred to fund a Prop House Round to create a marketing team for the challenge, the selection committee administration cost and the retrospective report on outcome.\n* $200k USD will be transferred to fund the prize pool.\n\n_If less than 4 teams do not meet the minimum qualifying criteria then any USDC that has not been used will be returned to the treasury._\n\n**Total Cost:** $200k + 30 Eth\n\n**Multisig**\n\nThe multisig is a 3/5 consisting of the 5 best looking members of the dao\n\n* [Hindsight](https://twitter.com/0Hindsight)\n* [Elad](https://twitter.com/eladmallel)\n* [Jarmen](https://twitter.com/jarmen43)\n* [Maty](https://twitter.com/matyETH)\n* [Adrianmcli](https://twitter.com/adrianmcli)\n\n___\n\n**A note on the 'Marketing Dept' creation**\n\n\nThe prop house round for 25 eth will award 5 submissions 5 eth to market this challenge and try and find people and teams outside both inside and outside of Nouns to make submissions. I will draft the prop house round if this proposal succeeds. An idea of submissions that will be encouraged are: contacting media schools, creating a landing pages with instructions, engaging with influencers to promote etc. \n\n___\n\n\n**Why YouTube Views**\n\n\nAs stated earlier, YouTube views are not everything, but they do matter and after looking at the view count of Nouns content I think we could benefit from a proposal with a proposal that has goals in terms of distribution as well as production. \n\nMany of these videos will have more views on Twitter and other platforms and I would expect the same from any video created for this challenge. But for the interest of managing the proposal we will have to set one medium as the primary one for measurement and I think YouTube is the most appropriate.\n\n2k views to reach the minimum entry requirement may seem small, and it is, but remember this is a MINIMUM, and we would expect any video that qualifies in the Top 10 to have many more views than that. \n\nHere you can see how many views Nounish content is currently getting on YouTube\n[![YT-V.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/XYSbwxm9/YT-V.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/bsTWP0zv)\n\nWhile some content that that use gimmicks, shows a lack of creativity nor effort, or does not show a clear comprehension of what the Nouns ecosystem is may meet the minimum qualifying criteria (whether due to the creator having large existing YouTube following or otherwise), ultimately the winning pieces of content be decided upon by a Nouner vote and so are extremely unlikely to be awarded anything for their efforts. So anyone who creates a video with the expectation of success should keep it classy and keep it Nounish.   \n"},{"blockNumber":16130488,"blockHash":"0xe853209749800bb6eec5feecb66b9c9ae2c9dc308dacb62c3bc8c7a5cbadc442","transactionIndex":101,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xb6903e6cf93fd8e833746c5a35aa95736fd2c8f71d18a869eefac913b0342263","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":182,"proposer":"0xc2d4f2D86E9fF3415C7e0C3Ee44C8819D25Fe413","targets":["0x9c74aE08Fd4337E14786f086D911E964df35e623"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":16144888,"endBlock":16180888,"description":"# Nouns AR Filters\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\n- Create 37 additional Augmented Reality Noun heads (increasing from 13 to 50 on Snapchat)\n- Heads will be fully expressive with responsive eyes, mouth, eyebrows, and custom animations\n- For the first time, bring all 50 Noun heads and 23 glasses to TikTok and Instagram\n\n**Why?**\n- AR filters can fully replace a person’s head or overlay Noggles to:\n  - Record Nounish content within Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok. \n  - Live stream as a Noun on Zoom, Discord, Twitch, etc.\n  - Remix and Nounify TV and movie clips to make memes\n\n**Compensation: 49.4 ETH**\n\n---\n## MEMES AND LIVESTREAMS\n![](https://imgur.com/sSv90Sh.jpeg)\n*Remixing existing footage and Nounifying it*\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/7N5B1WA.jpeg)\n*Noun Square live stream*\n\n[![](https://imgur.com/cEfJSf7.jpeg)](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1312698913)\n[*Twitch stream by Dota2 Esport Team*](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1312698913)\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/R60fKbf.jpeg)\n*On-chain proposal using the filters*\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/LeMQ1NN.jpeg)\n![](https://imgur.com/PEW6XYS.jpeg)\n*Simple GIFs made with [Snap AR filter noggles](https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&amp;uuid=d1507087c8f5479f89a73464805f76cb&amp;metadata=01), see [Tenor page](https://tenor.com/users/coralorca).*\n\n[![](https://imgur.com/dq8BsTw.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG14_cNTFqY)\n*[Nouns Coffee unboxing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG14_cNTFqY)*\n\n---\n## **VALUE PROPOSITION**\n\nThe Snap filters I created previously were used by the Dota2 Esport team (See [Grand Finals livestream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1312698913)), the Noun Square team (see [PropHouse winners interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOP8N49QBTc)), Nounish videos (currently in production) and can be seen in some on-chain proposals and memes across Twitter and Discord. \n\nThere is an increasing demand for Nounish content creation tools, and I often get the question: **\"Wen my Noun in AR?\".**\n\nWe are in the media propagation phase of Nouns, and with the expectation of AR-VR glasses becoming a main computational platform in the near future, Nouns should be AR-ready.\n\nI propose to craft an initial set of 50 heads as expressive Augmented Reality filters, with responsive eyes, mouth, and eyebrows motion, as well as fun animations, depending on each Noun (e.g. a dripping brush, a fin flapping shark etc).\n\nThese filters will be simultaneously published on Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok.\n\nNouns AR filters can be used for :\n* Nounish Videos / interviews / social reels\n* Live streaming / podcasts\n* Undoxxed video calls\n* Memes and GIFs. See my Tenor page https://tenor.com/users/coralorca\n* Side proliferation on large social networks with common keywords.

You can speed up the pipeline with work habits and experience, but each head requires specific attention to craft the Nounish details that make the difference.\n\n## **METRICS**\nI will share metrics from the different social platforms with the community.\nHere are some metrics from the Snapchat filters created with Prophouse funding and some recently published filters on TikTok.\n\n#### TIKTOK\n![](https://imgur.com/Qdb7oSX.jpeg)\n###### Close to 20k plays in two weeks with 0 marketing.\n\n#### SNAPCHAT\n\n![](https://imgur.com/PFoW7Ri.jpeg)\n\n###### The Robot Noun’s head has almost 600k plays in November! This is an interesting case of side effect proliferation. \n\n![](https://imgur.com/T1NMuqt.jpeg)\n\n###### BudLight was the first filter created, and currently totals over 4k plays.\n\n\n\n\n\n## **PORTING MODELS TO INSTAGRAM AND TIKTOK**\nI will import the 50 models to Meta’s and TikTok’s AR authoring software (respectively *SparkAR* and *Effect House*) to publish them to Instagram, Messenger, Facebook, and TikTok and reach a wider audience. \nRegarding the workflow, the 3D assets will be re-used, however, they still need to be imported, positioned, scaled, lit and the animation triggers need to be configured on an individual basis and depending on each software capabilities. \nFrom a technical standpoint Snap Lens Studio > SparkAR > TikTok Effect house. My goal is to make each Noun head as consistent as technically possible across all different platforms. See Frog head above.\n\n## **WHICH NOUN AND WHEN**\nI will deliver between 10 and 20 heads per month, released on the three platforms simultaneously as they are created. I will create community requested heads first, and otherwise will craft the traits that I think will be the most successful. \n👉Here is an open To-do if you want to add your favorite traits to the list: \nhttps://www.notion.so/Filters-List-1b12bdc8b51e42f4b726b650b3784f7a\n\n![](https://imgur.com/lrjR7ac.jpeg)\n\n###### Potential AR Filters candidates \n\n## **COMPENSATION**\nFor the Prophouse winning rounds, I suggested 4 filters for 2 ETH, when ETH was around 1800-2000 USD. The market price for such 3D AR lenses sits between 1500-5000 USD per filter. \nFor reference, [this MAYC filter I created](https://www.instagram.com/ar/1025321405001469/) was commissioned by LollaPalooza for Snapchat and IG and was around 5k USD - It is a little more complex with many eyes and snot coming out of the nose.\n\nWith ETH currently around 1200 USD, I adjusted the price to 3 filters for 2 ETH, around 800 USD.\n\n- Setting up the geometry and creating the expressions system for each of the 37 heads in Blender.\n**(37/3) * 2 = 24.7**\n\n- Porting the geometry to TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, setting up the animation triggers and publishing to these platform with consistent tagging and video previews.\nI am estimating this work at 0.18 ETH per filter for a total of 137 filters.\n**(50 on TikTok + 50 on Instagram + 37 on Snapchat) * 0.18 = 24.7**\n\nThis brings the total ask at **49.4 ETH** with an average price of 0.36 ETH per filter. \n\n---\n\n## **ETH ADDRESS**\n\n0x9c74aE08Fd4337E14786f086D911E964df35e623\n\n## **WHO I AM**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/jmO7FHf.jpeg)\n\nCoral Orca:\n- Community member \n- Early Nouncillor\n- 3D buildor: visualization with voxels, AR and VR, architecture and art. \n- [Prop 2](https://nouns.wtf/vote/2) we created [https://3dnouns.com](https://3dnouns.com/) with [0xFloyd](https://twitter.com/0xfloyd)\n- [Prop 126](https://nouns.wtf/vote/126) With [John Hamon](https://twitter.com/johnhamon_)\n\nHappy to be here, and build with my internet friends. \n\nThank you for reading this proposal!\n\nFeel free to tag me on Twitter or Discord to answer any questions.

Over that time period, Prop House has become a core piece of infrastructure for the development of the Nouns ecosystem – onboarding a sizable percentage of the most impactful builders while spreading the Nouns meme far and wide. We are requesting 570 ETH to continue to fund development of Prop House over the next 6 months (Jan ‘23 - Jun ‘23).*\n\n---\n\n***State of the Prop House(s):**\nOn Dec 1st, 2022, Seneca hosted an open call to update the community on what we’ve been up to since the [proposal #105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105). You can view the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TbJsbXWCPxbMyE25Xr_kfQjJJYMtGw0HEYuLrtdkndI/edit?usp=sharing) and recording of the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD9v1ihIRmw).*\n\n---\n\n## Onboarding builders\nThe most important outcome of Prop House for Nouns has been its ability to onboard a large percentage of the most impactful builders in the ecosystem. **More than funding, the core feature of Prop House is about activating builders**. Whether it be for folks who had never heard of Nouns before or those who were just hanging around, Prop House was the mechanism that took them from inactive to building within the ecosystem.\n\nGiven Nouns is about bottom-up brand building as opposed to top-down centralized direction, we hope that Prop House can continue to serve as a tool to execute on that Nouns vision. Below is a list of some of the builders who’ve been activated by Prop House:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2ZeeWk9.png)\n\n## Where we are today by the numbers\nOur last proposal ([#105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105)) passed on July 18, 2022. Since then, we’ve made substantial progress on all core Prop House KPIs:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JtrkRUm.png)\n\nAll our charts are seeing sustained month-over-month growth despite market downturns:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fBw6qTd.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P5rXSsH.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4q3e9hS.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jr1bwSR.jpg)\n\nThe funnel from prop award to prop completion has maintained a high conversion rate. Close to 85% of all prop winners go on to complete their proposed work. Below is an analysis on all prop winners from all funding rounds within the [Nouns house](https://prop.house/nouns) (18 funding rounds and 105 awarded proposals):\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/H71CV2j.jpg)\n\n## Spreading the Nouns meme\nOver the past 5 months we’ve onboarded several communities, most notably [Meebits](https://prop.house/meebits) via [Ape Coin DAO funding](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-110-meebits-prophouse-sponsored-by-apecoin/8219). By doing so, Prop House has spread the Nouns meme far beyond our immediate community. In tandem with Prop House growth comes furthering the reach of the Nouns meme along with what Nouns stands for: building.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nTQsPIo.jpg)\n\n## Product\nThe Prop House team has been busy working on the core product ([prop.house](https://prop.house)). A brief summary of what we’ve done follows:\n\n- Contracted one the best designers in the space (0xHab from Rainbow)\n- Revamped UI across the entire app\n- Implemented multi-round houses\n- Upgraded voting UX\n- Open sourced the [repository](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/).\n- Released a [GraphQL interface](https://prod.backend.prop.house/graphql) for Prop House data which lead to projects like [NounsAtlas](https://nounsatlas.com), [Voters.wtf](https://voters.wtf) and [Nounish.cv](https://nounish.netlify.app/)\n\n## Protocol\nWe’ve also made strides in the development of the Prop House protocol.\n\nThe protocol leverages both Ethereum and Starknet in an effort to provide the best possible user experience. This dual-chain architecture enables Prop House users to propose and vote by signing a message, while decentralizing the entire funding flow.\n\nWe use Ethereum as the operations and execution layer, where houses are managed and payouts are made, while Starknet handles all user actions that occur within a funding round.\n\nAll of the code is publicly available today in the [Prop House repository](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/tree/protocol).\n\nBelow are some of the core pieces of infrastructure we’ve developed to support the protocol, where we are currently, and what to expect as we near mainnet launch:\n\n- The [protocol](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/tree/protocol/packages/prop-house-contracts) itself, which has been deployed to Goerli.\n- The [Prop House SDK](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/tree/protocol/packages/prop-house-sdk), which simplifies interaction with the protocol (L1 & L2).\n- The Starknet Relayer, which is responsible for submitting signed proposals and votes to Starknet on behalf of users.\n- Ethereum & Starknet subgraphs, which are currently in development.\n- Current blockers:\n    - [Cairo V1 Migration](https://medium.com/starkware/open-sourcing-cairo-1-0-b3100a664bb0)\n    - [Support for V1 on StarkNet](https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-regenesis-the-plan-bd0219843ef4) (expected Q1 ‘23)\n    - Protocol audits (pending testing on testnet)\n\nAssuming no major hiccups, we aim to deploy the protocol to mainnet before the end of Q1 2023.\n\n## Financials\n*The Prop House financials doc is publicly available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iKGgedZmAzMNCFkd2PqjBd-ZgutrOjuYqfirDG1wS3g/edit?usp=sharing)*\n\nOver the course of one year and three proposals ([#23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23), [#62](https://nouns.wtf/vote/62), [#105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105)), Nouns DAO has funded the Prop House team 555 ETH for deploying towards Nouns builders and 695 ETH for development and operating expenses.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oxC4c8l.png)\n\n*Note: current burn rate for Nouns funding rounds is low (~20-30 ETH / mo). If at any point the DAO chooses to have another party deploy Nouns House Funding, we will return all remaining funds to the DAO.*\n\n## What’s next?\n### Protocol launch\nWe are aiming for a mainnet launch by the end of Q1 2023. What follows is the timeline we are executing against to get to launch:\n\n- Migrate to Cairo V1\n- Complete Goerli testing\n- Finalize Prop House SDK & Starknet Relayer\n- Launch subgraphs for Ethereum & Starknet\n- Developer documentation\n- Protocol audit\n\n### Product development\nAlongside the transition to the protocol as the data layer, we will continue to develop the UX of app:\n- Core UX: better proposing, discovery and voting user experiences.\n- The launch of house and round managers such that anyone can create a house, deposit funds and initiate funding rounds.\n- Implementation for infinite rounds for grant pods to run their entire operation via Prop House.\n- Develop social features for communities. \n\n## Sustainability\nThere are several avenues to explore on how to make Prop House sustainable. For the time being, we are continuing to pursue funding by Nouns DAO as we believe it to be a positive sum engagement. Below we dive into potential avenues:\n\n### Nouns DAO funded (current)\nTo date, Nouns DAO has funded development costs of Prop House over the past ~12 months (695 ETH). For the current model to continue to work, Nouners would have to agree that the value created for Nouns by Prop House is higher than that of the development costs. In this framing, Nouns DAO is a patron to Prop house where its ROI is the onboarding of high impact builders, the attention generated by Prop House as public infrastructure by Nouns DAO and it being infrastructure for Nouns to run on.\n\n### Fees for usage\nThe true and tried approach is turning on fees at the client and/or protocol. This approach would require a substantial increase in volume (to the order of about 50-100x) to maintain current burn rates. So while feasible, it is not a solution for the short term. \n\n### Experimental\n**Nounish DAO**\nIn prop [#105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105), we posed Prop House DAO as a plausible avenue to making Prop House sustainable. While it is still a potential route, there are concerns as to whether or not the DAO makes sense at all. At the core of it is whether the Nouns DAO format is appropriate for non-purely meme driven protocols. There’s also the question of whether every protocol needs a DAO and a corresponding governance token. So while the DAO is not out of the question, we believe that with experiments like [Nouns Builder](https://nouns.build/), the answer will become clearer over time. \n**Pure Meme NFTs**\nThere’s a case to be made where Prop House NFTs are minted to hold provenance value. This alone could capture long-term upside in the same way a visual artist and their collectors do. \n\n## Funding Request\n570 ETH to fund development of Prop House protocol & client over the next 6 months (Jan ‘23 - Jun ‘23). \n- 486 ETH: 3 engineers, 1 designer and 1 all hats.\n- 84 ETH for OpEx including contractors, infra, audits, bounties, translators, etc.\n\nFunds would be received by the [Prop House team multi-sig (3/5)](https://app.safe.global/eth:0x5BcD6f3B0a5519D448FBDf33204091bbE097C992/) where the signers are Seneca, Solimander, CDT, VapeApe and Devcarrot."},{"blockNumber":16141338,"blockHash":"0xb84f511d5f33d17c4be592eeb409b616bef3771642952364c997d59955f18715","transactionIndex":115,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x737527b043841f7ef905c3351e8073f3bedc5a32f2ca1ac576995928e0c892b8","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":184,"proposer":"0xa555d1Ee16780B2d414eD97f4f169c0740099615","targets":["0x9D727911B54C455B0071A7B682FcF4Bc444B5596"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":16155738,"endBlock":16191738,"description":"# Nouns funding ZachXBT\n\n**NOTE: This prop is a resubmit of prop 177 since it was cancelled in the \"queued\" stage due to [my error](https://twitter.com/noun40__/status/1600889013216235525).

Recent events have highlighted the dire need and importance of such work. This prop proposes to fund 100 ETH to their donation address: zachxbt.eth (address can be verified from their twitter profile).\n\nDonations have always been somewhat controversial within Nouns governance. [Prop 21](https://nouns.wtf/vote/21) donating 169 ETH to Gitcoin grants was one of the most contentious votes in our early history. [Prop 108](https://nouns.wtf/vote/108) donating 500 ETH to Ethereum protocol development (via the Protocol Guild) was much more unanimous but still there was discomfort and discourse around whether the DAO was becoming \"a tax inefficient way for DAO members to make donations.\"\n\nI agree that we shouldn't resort to becoming a complacent vehicle of passive philanthropy. We should instead aim to actively contribute and be a net producer of public goods ourselves such that our meme (brand) can fully capture the provenance value (claim on originality of) the public work and thus leverage the virtuous cycle to do more than what capital alone could have done. However, there should be exceptions to this rule if there is an urgent and common public cause that warrants highlighting. I would like to suggest that this is such a case. Crypto needs more validators like ZachXBT.\n\nWith donations we need to be extra wary of conflicts of interest or self-dealing. Unfortunately there is no way to prove this cryptographically, but I attest that I have no prior (or planned future) relationship with ZachXBT and that today was the first time I contacted them (via twitter) to ask for their permission to make this proposal."},{"blockNumber":16141447,"blockHash":"0xd60cb2a44684e79a981ecbc94ada71534d44062ea399cb1ffc5dc31ae65f6303","transactionIndex":192,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x07a92b8f24710ac12aabec1e74ca53e82c9cdf6a6d29d08efe74694c72353598","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":185,"proposer":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","targets":["0xd8e6b954f7d3F42570D3B0adB516f2868729eC4D","0x6ff4FF4Fe59D7EC571f36e36961B032027e68ceE","0x6ff4FF4Fe59D7EC571f36e36961B032027e68ceE","0x6ff4FF4Fe59D7EC571f36e36961B032027e68ceE"],"signatures":["setApprovalForAll(address,bool)","addAllowance(address,uint256)","addAllowance(address,uint256)","addAllowance(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000006ff4ff4fe59d7ec571f36e36961b032027e68cee0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001","0x000000000000000000000000b903576f03a1010d7b915783c728b5c39edd9a540000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000032","0x0000000000000000000000000658f4ed17289144717713adffc2539ef7c2ef8e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000032","0x0000000000000000000000008b45d1caccb3593e9f1015ba8e97afb68de3a0d10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000032"],"startBlock":16155847,"endBlock":16191847,"description":"# Distributing Nouns Vision Noggles for Proliferation Purposes\n\nWritten by [Sasquatch](https://twitter.com/PartSasquatch), [Toady](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/toadyhawk.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8), [Maty](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/maty.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8), [Benbodhi](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/benbodhi.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8) and [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami).\nSpecial thanks to [9999](https://twitter.com/lastpunk9999) for helping by creating the [custom contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6ff4FF4Fe59D7EC571f36e36961B032027e68ceE#code).\n\n## Intro:\n[Prop 57](https://nouns.wtf/vote/57) funded the creation of 8,250 pairs of luxury sunglasses made by Nouns Vision.

We want to make governance participation fun. \n\nOur vision is to create a governance platform that is both delightful and easy to use, empowering voters to effectively govern NounsDAO. The client is being created on top of an upcoming open-source framework, built by nounish developers, for nounish developers.\n\n# Current progress\n\nWe've had early success with [House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.wtf/), with many Nouners and non-Nouners alike expressing their love of the intuitive interface. We want to continue building on this success and make it easier for people to participate in governance in an engaging way.\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 9.40.34 PM.png](https://imgur.com/D7F1Q0a.png)\n\nNot familiar with House of Nouns? You can discuss proposals with others, view important context, and vote all in one intuitive interface on [https://houseofnouns.wtf](https://houseofnouns.wtf). \n\n**Some data:** \n\n- MAUs - growing 100% month / month\n    \n    ![Screen Shot 2022-12-08 at 7.03.38 PM.png](https://imgur.com/aKCSwBO.png)\n    \n- Working with Nouns, Lil Nouns, and Gnars. In talks with many more communities.\n    \n    [https://houseoflilnouns.wtf](https://houseoflilnouns.wtf/proposals/69)\n    \n    [https://gnars.house](https://gnars.house) \n    \n- ~13.5% registered-user market penetration\n    - 170 registered users / 1263 total members in Nouns (delegates + Nouners + anyone who has voted or made a proposal on-chain or in Prop House)\n\n# **Core vision and goals**\n\nOur vision is to make it easier for voters to participate in Nouns governance by providing rich context, intuitive conversation tools, and seamless integrations with other Nounish platforms. This will be built on top of an open framework, empowering developers and solving impactful problems specific to nounish governance. \n\nIn short:\n\n- Provide all context on proposals, voters, builders, and team members, and view all conversations from Discord, Twitter, and Discourse in one place\n- Build a custom forum client directly into HoN that is backwards compatible w/Discourse, allowing users to create and discuss proposal drafts and get early feedback\n- Provide first-class support for Nouns forks and Prop House, and deeper integrations with Atlas, Federation and Agora\n- Create the open source House of Nouns framework, serving core data displayed on the site through a GraphQL API, paired with a developer friendly SDK for building on top of House of Nouns infrastructure\n\n## Product Breakdown\n\n### **Context layer**\n\nWe will attach more information to proposals, such as FAQs, comments, relevant links, conversations from other platforms, video attachments, and more. We're currently working with @maty.eth on integrating data from [proposals.wtf](http://proposals.wtf). \n\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-09 at 1.20.48 PM.png](https://imgur.com/NWxsu7o.png)\n\nWe also will provide more context on Nouners, builders, and team members, such as their past proposals, voting record, and Agora profile, directly in HoN. \n\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 9.35.06 PM.png](https://imgur.com/b8zipr3.png)\n\nAfter a proposal is executed, we will make it easy to see what has been delivered as a result.\n\n### Forums + conversation stack\n\nWe're building an alternative forum client like Discourse that pulls data from Discourse, and integrates token signaling and Ethereum-based identities. This will be built into House of Nouns and will allow users to create and discuss proposal drafts, get early feedback, and graduate drafts to proposals. It will also provide context on builders and [members](https://collective.xyz/nouns/members), and allow token-based voting.\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-09 at 1.19.55 PM.png](https://imgur.com/oXSPL8Y.png)\n\nWe also want to provide more intuitive ways to get early community consensus, such as upvote/idea boards. This will allow users to easily move from an idea to a draft proposal, get comments, and then move to an on-chain proposal with ongoing comments and voting.\n\n### Integrations\n\nDeeper integrations with other Nounish products like Nouns Atlas and Nouns Agora. \n\nView conversation from Discord, Twitter, Discourse etc. in-line on [houseofnouns.wtf](http://houseofnouns.wtf). \n\nFirst class support for Nouns forks, Prop House, Federation, and other governance sources\n\n- one-click governance clients for Nouns forks\n- vote on Prop House rounds directly in HoN with intuitive and easy UI\n- Federation integration (ex: vote on HoN as a Gnars holder)\n\nWhile we will make sure our infrastructure can support all Nounish communities, we will focus on solving problems specific to Nouns governance in the next 6 months. We believe this is where we can have the biggest impact.\n\n## House of Nouns Framework\n\nWe are building an open source framework to give builders the tools they need to build custom governance and discussion experiences for their communities. We will build House of Nouns on top of this framework, in a similar vein to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) being both a builder and end-user of NextJS. \n\nThe main components of the framework are:\n\nOpen access to core data displayed on the site through a GraphQL API.\n\nReact [SDK](https://github.com/collectivexyz/sdk) for developing on top of House of Nouns infrastructure, including hooks to access data, pre-built components etc. \n\n## Differentiation\n\nAgora approaches the problem of low governance participation from the delegation perspective. Don’t want to vote? Delegate to someone to do it for you. \n\nHouse of Nouns approaches it from the conversation and context-aggregation perspective.  Empowering Nouners to vote independently and be empowered to think for themselves. \n\nBoth approaches are valid and necessary for the ecosystem to grow. We will be working closely with Agora to ensure we don’t build the same things and otherwise waste valuable energy. \n\n## Success Metrics\n\nOur goal is to have 30% or more of the Nounish ecosystem using (voting/discussing/viewing) House of Nouns *every week*. Currently, about 14% are registered users. We believe that with further improvements to the proposal conversation stack and better user experience, we can reach this goal. \n\nUltimately, our goal is to have the House of Nouns framework and SDK integrated into 10 or more clients by July 2023.\n\nWe will use these as the two primary metrics to evaluate our success in 6 months.\n\n# **Transparency & decentralization**\n\nAs a governance platform, we want to avoid centralization of power by taking the following measures:\n\n- Building the House of Nouns framework as an open source public good\n    - Offer up all data through APIs and a developer friendly SDK\n    - Transition discussion data to open data layers as soon as an attractive option has wide adoption / traction\n    - Offer a React SDK for components and data fetching\n- Current House of Nouns team members added together will commit to not represent more than 5% of NounsDAO.\n\nOur goal is to open-source the core building blocks of governance and discussion, and provide killer developer tooling on top of the HoN rails so anyone can build custom experiences for their communities and subcultures. \n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe plan to generate revenue by offering bespoke upgrades to other DAOs similar to Red Hat, as well as charging hosting costs for larger communities. Our goal is for the HoN client to become self-sustainable within 12-16 months. These upgrades will be built into the broader platform and framework for all users. \n\nFor the HoN framework, we’re exploring alternative public goods funding routes (Nouns model, Gitcoin etc.) so we can be empowered to continue building something maximally useful for the entire ecosystem. \n\n# ********Team********\n\nWe are a small startup [(collective.xyz)](https://twitter.com/collectivexyz) that has been building for Nouns and won the governance client mandate [round](https://prop.house/nouns/nouns-governance-clients) 3 months ago. \n\nHouse of Nouns team:\n\n[dadkins](https://twitter.com/dadkins_) - 9 years in software, longtime crypto hacker, cofounder [@collective.xyz](https://twitter.com/collective.xyz)\n\nwhise - lead data engineer ex: Amazon / longtime buildor\n\n[Wojciech](https://kocjan.net/) - Killer product engineer, built [nounslaunchpad.wtf](https://nounslaunchpad.wtf)\n\n[Tim G](https://github.com/timmyg) - former head of engineering at crypto startup, full stack maestro\n\nwith support from [rocketman](https://twitter.com/rocketman_w) and [jac](https://github.com/jac18281828)\n\n# Funding Request\n\nWe compare closely to other proposals, like [Agora’s 3-month proposal](https://houseofnouns.xyz/proposals/154) (170 ETH for a team of 4 for 3 months (14 ETH per mo./ person), or Nouns AI Pod (12.75 ETH per mo./ person). \n\nWe request 340 ETH in USDC to fund development of House of Nouns framework & client over the next 6 months (Jan ‘23 - Jun ‘23).\n\n• 330 ETH: 4+ engineers (13.75 ETH per mo./ person)\n\n• 10 ETH: funding for Prop House round(s) to build out alternative clients and views into governance+discussion on top of the HoN framework.  \n\n50% deposited immediately to the teams wallet via [USDC payments contract](https://nouns.wtf/vote/172).\n\n50% USDC streamed over a period of 6 months from a 3/5 multisig held by trusted members of the community.

We'll build tools for users to generate & access their own animations quickly and easily for use in any project. There's 20 unique and thoughtfully crafted animations to choose from with over 467,000,000 possible animation outcomes.\n\n* Through a front-end app, anyone can enter a Noun ID or mix and match traits to create their own custom Noun and export animations on the spot.\n* Developers will be able to programmatically access any of these animations instantly and seamlessly through an API and/or a URL.\n* Interact with your Noun (including custom ones) through an interactive app on a daily basis with actions like eating, sleeping, playing, and more! The status of each Noun will change throughout the day and you can tend to it accordingly to keep it alive, happy, and healthy.\n\n## Introduction & Background\n---\nHello Everyone,\n\nI'm Jeff (aka heyjeff.eth, jefe) and I’ve been developing an app over the past year that aims to engage NFT collectors by bringing their NFTs to life. Quick backstory:\n\nThe concept was inspired by the popular Japanese phenomenon ‘Tamagotchi’ released in the late 90’s. Each handheld device contains a virtual friend the user must tend to in order to keep it alive, happy, and healthy. Interestingly enough, it’s a style of game that you don’t necessarily ‘beat’ or ‘win’. It’s more of an experience of having a buddy that you can play with, care for, and watch grow throughout it’s lifespan, forever.\n\nI thought it’d be fun if people could do the same with their NFTs, so I decided to build a prototype. At first it started out as just a silly napkin sketch, but now we’re proud to say we’ve recently finished adding support for all 6,969 CrypToadz, each with 11 unique animations totaling over 75,000 files! *(That’s 7.6 GB of raw toad data)*. For those who own a CrypToad, you can check out the app [here](https://tinycitizen.xyz).\n\nHere’s some footage:\n[![CrypToadz Gameplay](https://i.imgur.com/KHs4MZi.png)](https://vimeo.com/780511900)\n\n\n## Motivation and Goals\n---\nWhat we’re aiming to do is leverage the tech we’ve developed for CrypToadz and adapt it to build tools so that anyone can generate, access, and download Nounish animations on demand for cc0 use.\n\nTo do this, we’ll develop an easy-to-use Build-a-Noun app through which anyone can choose a pre-existing Noun or build their own by mixing and matching traits at will or at random. Users will be able to preview animations on the fly and then instantly download any or all of the animations they like, with the option of exporting the individual animation frames as well. The app is future-proofed too, so every Noun that is born each day will be readily accessible.\n\nNot only that, but any animation for any Noun configuration can be easily accessible via a back-end API and/or a URL for developers to use in their web apps instantly and seamlessly.\n\nAs an added bonus, anyone can immediately interact and play with their Noun or custom Noun through our other interactive app we’ve already built!\n\nUltimately, the goal of all of this is to empower people to actively use Nouns in engaging, refreshing, and easy ways to help spread the meme.\n\n## Build-A-Noun App, prototype & poc\n(early prototype shown, does not represent final product)\n[![Build-A-Noun Prototype](https://i.imgur.com/Viv5UfU.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/777492078)\n\nThe 20 total actions and states are: idle (breathing/blinking), happy/loved, laughing, talking, dancing/head bob, eating: pizza, mushroom, veggies, fruit, hamburger, playing a gameboy, sad/crying, drinking: coffee, water, tea, health/mana potion, tired, sick, and sleeping.\n\nThe above is an early prototype solely to convey the concept of the Build-A-Noun app. The final product will have a redesigned and intuitive interface, with way more options and functionality, such as:\n* Select transparent or any background color (hex or rbg input)\n* Quick select any existing Noun ID config\n* Searchable traits by ID or name\n* Randomize traits button\n* Flip the animation (left-facing vs right-facing)\n* Change output animation speed\n* Apply an rbg tint to the animation\n* Apply a black and white filter to the animation\n* Resize animation to specific dimensions\n* Export all individual frames for a given animation\n* Pick and choose which animations to export\n* Add text overlays\n* Share-to-Twitter button to quickly tweet your creations \n\nFlipped![](https://i.imgur.com/bIxYeRQ.gif) B/w filter![](https://i.imgur.com/eI9okhg.gif)\nrbg(255, 5, 555) tint![](https://i.imgur.com/1n2f2xY.gif) Sped up 3x![](https://i.imgur.com/FsMU13t.gif) Flipped, 0.75x speed, rbg(293, 65, 5) tint![](https://i.imgur.com/AaLiqTR.gif)\n\n\n*Examples of animation customization options*\n\nIn total, we’d pre-generate 8,700 animation files (435 Nouns assets x 20 unique states), each with an average of 30 frames per animation. That's  a total of 261,000 individual frames to bring this vision to life! There are 23,377,200 possible combinations for a Noun, and 467,544,00 possible animations outcomes (23,377,200 x 20)!\n\n\n## Why?\n---\nCurrently, there isn't a scalable tool in the Nouniverse that allows users to quickly produce a wide range of highly customizable Nounish cc0 animations on demand.\n\nGame developers, content creators, and everyday users can benefit from such a tool as a building block to create even bigger and more Nounish things!\n\nWe're trying to fill this gap in the Nounscape by providing STOMMs (*Super Tool of Mass-Memeification*) in an area that is lacking. With this tool in place, I believe we'll see an explosion of new Nounish content for everyone to use and enjoy as they see fit.\n\nPlus, being able to interact with your Noun deepens our emotional connection to them!\n\n## Sneak Peeks\n---\nWe made the following animations for Lil Nouns for fun as a test, but the same concepts apply for Nouns. Here's a peek at 10 out of the 20 total states. Choose any background color you like, or none at all (transparent).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/u0ZdEUw.gif)\nIdle\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p9ecpWa.gif)\nEating pizza\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ygk8hBI.gif)\nSleeping\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/euvT8qO.gif)\nPlaying Gameboy\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CqHr6cL.gif)\nHappy\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Wnxg4Uj.gif)\nSad/Crying\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1TBwth1.gif)\nDrinking coffee\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LmXiVcz.gif)\nSick\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qbxc4Wy.gif)\nTired\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oIWI1F3.gif)\nHealth potion\n\n## Interactive App ~ Bonus ~\n---\nAnyone who owns a Noun or builds one with our Noun Builder app can interact with it on a daily basis through an app we've already built (works on mobile too)! Each Noun will be animated to reflect it's current state or action - it will truly feel like your Noun has come to life!\n\nHere are the following mechanics:\n\n4 Stats (each max val of 100):\n* Fullness\n* Energy\n* Happiness\n* Health\n\n3 Player Actions (each grants XP needed in order to level up):\n* Feeding – Increases fullness and happiness\n* Sleeping – Increases energy and health\n* Playing – Increases happiness, decreases fullness and energy\n\n3 Conditions:\n* Can’t sleep while starving\n* Can’t play while sleep-deprived\n* Can’t eat while sick\n\n3 Items (purchasable with points earned from completing actions)\n* Coffee – Triples the amount of XP gained, but cannot sleep for 8 hr\n* Health Potion – Replenishes health to full\n* Mushroom (can be easily reskinned to another object) – 1 of 4 potential effects, chosen at random:\n    * Jumbles stats at random\n    * Earn a random amount of XP\n    * Gain 1 level\n    * Eat a poisonous mushroom and die\n* All stats decay by 2 every 4 hours automatically, forever\n* Sometimes, at random, 1 of the 4 stats will be depleted to zero if all stats are non-zero\n* If neglected for ~8 days, the NFT will die\n* NFTs can be revived, but lose 1 level and costs points\n* Highest levels are ranked in a public leaderboard\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PaRnHTs.gif)\n*Nounish interactive gameplay demo (limited features)*\n\n\n## How is this valuable to Nouns??\n---\n\n### 1. Public Goods & Network Effects\n\nEveryone from experienced devs to everyday users will be able to generate & access Nounish animations on demand, either through the API or the front-end tool within a few clicks.\n\nThis means anyone -- enthusiasts, developers, and/or content creators can save countless hours by bootstrapping these animations to be used any way they like! Some examples include: \n\n* Enrich existing apps or websites\n* Use as stickers and/or emojis for Discord servers\n* Use the animations to develop a game\n* Use them to make merch and/or NFTs\n* Enhance Nounish media like tweets, infographics, or videos\n* Use as pfps\n* Download the individual animation frames to make sprite sheets\n* Use the frame data to create lip-synced animated avatars for video/audio calls\n\n-- the possibilities are endless!\n\nThe end result will lead to quicker turnarounds for prototypes and media creations, and act as a catalyst for the proliferation of new Nounish content overall.\n\nQuote from devcarrot, Nounder:\n\"This sounds like a very fun idea, I love the animations. Would you be willing to make the data accessible to other developers via a public API? Maybe with something like a license that requires attribution? It could be interesting to have Nounish characters hanging out on the various projects’ sites; imagine Timpers’ disco floor but with TinyCitizen characters rendered in real time.\n\nThe disco floor:\n![](https://cdck-file-uploads-europe1.s3.dualstack.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/a/a30c42ece4e30f7f4aac00f6979b82a057b19eb9.gif)\"\n\n\n### 2. Rally community around organic and fun reward systems\n\nThrough the interactive app we’ve already built, it provides opportunities for users to earn rewards through quests.\n\nAs an example, we’ve successfully rewarded 80+ unique CrypToadz players with a CrypToadz hat and pair of Nouns glasses to those who reached level 10 with a CrypToad through the interactive app. Everyone shared how much they loved this event!\n\nThis provides a more rewarding experience because the merch drop felt earned rather than simply given. In turn, it promotes camaraderie and a sense of fellowship among the community who want to achieve a mutual desired result by partaking in shared experiences.\n\nAny Nounish DAO that wishes to engage their audience can task their community with completing certain actions through the app and granting them an award upon completion.\n\n**Reward bundle: CrypToadz Hat + Noun Glasses + NFT NYC Coaster**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Xupiot6.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f8PToWz.jpg)\n\n*pssst… This event is still ongoing! If you want a CrypToadz hat and Nouns glasses you can still grind for them! Find me on Discord :wink:*\n\n### 3. Tap into & activate new creators and builders\nIf we make these assets readily available for people to access in an engaging and easy manner, it could open up doors for new people to enter the ecosystem.\n\nThose that need assets to build on Nouns in new or interesting ways but have no developer or animation experience can often feel discouraged not knowing where to start.\n\nWith the Build-A-Noun app as a building block, we can inspire existing Nounish community members as well as potential new ones to create something Nounish easily and quickly. Anyone can get up and running with tens, hundreds, or thousands of animations ready to use within minutes.\n\n\n## Deliverables\n---\n* Create an easy-to-use front-end tool + website where anyone can create and download unique cc0 gifs for any Noun configuration on the spot. The 20 unique states/actions are:\n    * Idle (breathing + blinking)\n    * Happy/Loved\n    * Sad/Crying\n    * Laughing\n    * Talking\n    * Sleeping\n    * Dancing/Head bob\n    * Eating\n        * pizza\n        * mushroom\n        * fruit\n        * veggies\n        * hamburger\n    * Drinking\n        * coffee\n        * water\n        * tea\n        * health potion\n        * mana potion\n    * Playing a gameboy\n    * Tired\n    * Sick\n* Create a back-end API, where anyone can instantly grab any animation for any Noun configuration for use in their web apps programmatically via an API key and/or a URL\n* Revamped front-end design with mobile-friendly version to generate animations on the go!\n* Integration with our existing free-to-play side-app where users can interact and play with their Nouns (already built)\n* Publicly host the raw base64 encoded png frame data for all Nouns assets in json format so anyone can use the animation frames how they like\n\n## Timeline\n---\n### Total: 10 weeks\n\nEach individual trait needs to be manually animated for all 20 states. That's roughly ~1,000 files per week (435 x 20 / 8). Some take shorter than others because they're static in a given animation, or they mimic the same motion as another animation and can be ported. Regardless, there is a lot of upfront work to be done.\n\n### Weeks 1-4:\nFront-end work, complete site redesign and development. Mobile-friendly optimization. Developing gif creation software with various customization options.\n\n~50% of animations files complete\n\n### Weeks 5-8:\nBack-end work on API creation. Work on image processing and manipulating animation frame data. Create hosting solution for animation data.\n\n~100% of animation files complete\n\n### Weeks 9 & 10:\nHook-up back-end to front-end. Allow 2 week buffer for testing & bug fixes, or any last minute optimizations/improvements.\n\n## Who we are\n---\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EkzLRN9.gif)**heyjeff.eth** - Full-Stack Dev / Design / Vision / Logistics\n\nI’m an engineer, problem-solver, and purveyor of ideas that I believe are worth telling.\n\nI've been involved in the NFT space since early 2021 and became Noun-pilled a couple months ago through some people I’ve met within the CrypToadz community.

We were fascinated by the Nouns protocol and community and soon began building out sharkish tools to ease some of the unique challenges of a Nounish subDAO. We created a dashboard for SharkDAO, which included widgets for a snapshot client, calendar, and token-gated document center. We wanted to build a simple interface for casual members to be able to quickly catch up on the latest in SharkDAO and Nouns. Soon after, other communities asked if they could have their own dashboards. We open-sourced the code, modularized the components, and invited other web3 groups to join. Today, we’d describe [Calabara](https://calabara.com/explore) as an open-source design house for public infrastructure and applications.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/V819CqQ.png)\n\n\nBy prop [62](https://nouns.wtf/vote/62), we began to get excited about many of the ideas being communicated by the Prop House team. We'd been thinking deeply about community funding protocols for some time ourselves, and were eager to experiment with the Prop House model. Unfortunately, we weren’t yet able to run our own Prop House rounds at SharkDAO (because we don’t use an erc721 for governance). Prop House wasn’t open-source yet, so we decided to fork the core ideas of Prop House and build something of our own: Creator Contests. \n\n## Creator Contests … WTF?\n\nCreator Contests are a nounish middleware for distributing funds to creatives.\n\nCreating scalable funding infrastructure at all levels is a critical building block in establishing Nouns as the world's largest open-source brand. Creator contests build upon the strong foundations developed by the Prop House team while experimenting with novel features to create unique incentive systems and new ways to fund builders – allowing any Nounish community with an ENS the ability to start running their own contests.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nSimilar to Prop House, participants create submissions in response to a contest prompt, and voters choose the best ones. Once the contest is over, funds are distributed to the winners. All contests follow this basic model, but administrators have full control over the contest settings to layer-on additional components. Here’s what we offer today …\n\n* Submitter Rewards\n    * Define 1 or more winning ranks (1st, 2nd, ... nth place)\n    * Define 1 or more rewards for listed ranks (ETH, ERC20, ERC721)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LK2Vg12.png)\n\n* Voter Rewards\n    * Voters that accurately choose rank N submission will split X reward.\n    * Can be used to create unique incentive systems.\n    * NOMO-style games can be created, where voters join forces to try to choose the 2nd best submisison without pushing it to first place.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IBwqCwI.png)\n\n* Participant Restrictions\n    * Token thresholds required for participants to submit or vote\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/YcwFxhK.png)\n\n* Voting Strategies\n    * Token -- Voting power based on token holdings\n    * Arcade -- Uniform voting power for all qualifying voters\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/KpVyBT8.png)\n\n* Twitter Integration\n    * Collect submissions via Twitter interactions\n    * Inherit all existing infrastructure while proliferating via Twitter\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/0J7OkhJ.png)\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/cDWuZ26.gif)\n    \n* Additional Parameters\n    * Vote total visibility\n    * Anonymous Submissions\n    * Self Voting\n  ![](https://i.imgur.com/jkCGMtY.png)\n\n\n## Our Nounish Journey: part 2\n\nBefore Spring 2022, we had bootstrapped the project ourselves. We were lucky enough to receive support from SharkDAO, and they funded us with 7 ETH to develop an MVP of Creator Contests. We launched our first contest in September, and have helped fund 45 nounish creatives with ~4 ETH and 25k ERC-20 tokens since. 2 months ago, we received a small grant of 8 ETH from NSFW to develop the Twitter Integration mentioned above. We have groups like SharkDAO, Composables, TNS, and the Society of Nounish Cartoonists running contests as we speak. We are now ready to take Creator Contests to the next level.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Fk7grjB.png)\n\n\n## Goals for the funding period\n\nFor this funding period, we’d like to focus on “Top of the funnel” funding infrastructure. This means implementing a scalable protocol for funding creatives in the 0.069 - 3 ETH range. Our goal is to fund 100+ nounish creatives in the 3-month window.\n\nWhile bringing the codebase out of “MVP mode” so it can sufficiently scale to other Nounish pods (and make it easier to fork), we’ll work on the following upgrades:\n\n* Support native video and other media formats\n* Add vote audit reports\n* Add voting capability for Noun delegates\n* Experiment with new voting strategies\n* Simplify contest initialization process.\n* Improve our twitter algorithms\n* UX redesign - It’s time for CC to get Nounish\n\n\nWe’d also like to answer the following questions:\n\n* Are voter rewards a feature or a bug?\n* In the voting period, how impactful are visible vote totals on a communities ability to choose the “best” submissions?\n* Does submission history serve as a relevant talent repository for other pods?\n* Are deep Twitter integrations viable for other tasks, like governance? (Nouncil, Nerman, etc)\n* Are there ways to maintain a certain level of submission quality without directly moderating submissions?\n    * Prop House already sees a certain percentage of “low quality” submissions, and we’ll see higher levels at this funding tier. Are there ways to ensure a certain quality standard without direct moderation? Learnings from this experimentation could be layered on top of Prop House and other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Defining success\n\nSuccess at the funding tier we are targeting is tightly coupled with onboarding. We’ll define onboarding for the scope of this project as the following:\n\n* New creatives\n    * Introduce new creatives to Nouns and extension communities\n* Existing creatives to larger funding tiers\n    * Support creatives in the earliest stages of ideation that can translate to quality Prop House or NSFW proposals\n* Between Nounish extension communities\n    * Increase the discoverability factor of extension projects and communities through different contest designs and synergies, i.e.\n        * TNS and Composables co-host a round\n        * Multi-community voting\n        * Twitter contests\n\nOf course, success for us also hinders on our ability to proliferate the meme. Twitter integrations drastically increase our proliferation potential -- elevating contests from a siloed web app to a publicly discoverable and interactable experience. We're focused on lifting the stack as close to the \"public edge\" as possible and see the potential for these integrations in other Nounish areas.  \n\nDefining success is one thing, measuring it is different. For this funding term, we’ll do so manually by following up with participants and winners while exploring ways we can automate and better measure this in the future.\n\n\n## Prop House\n\n*Why not just fork Prop House for real?*\n\nWhile we haven’t really heard this much, it’s a valid question that we anticipate some Nouners might have.\n\nHalting further experimentation to go back and layer our changes on top of the PH codebase feels like a step backwards at this point in time. We envision a coordinated approach where both PH and CC are able to sandbox and test different ideas and merge the ones that work. Ultimately, the far more relevant component to fork will be the smart contracts for a trustless implementation that the PH team is leading, which we fully plan on doing. \n\nAt worst, CC is an alternative client for Prop House. At best, it is an experiment in funding infrastructure, working alongside Prop House in developing sound protocols for high velocity, trustless, and scalable funding infrastructure for web3 communities – all powered by Nouns.\n\n## Team\n\nWeez: frontend, designer, UX, support\nNick: lead dev, fullstack\n\n## Links\n* [Calabara](https://calabara.com/explore)\n* [Github](https://github.com/calabara-hq/calabara)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/calabarahq)\n\n## Budget\n\n60 ETH for continued development\n\n3/5 Multisig tasked with sending 30 ETH of project funds to the team wallet upon execution, and setting up a 3-month stream for the remaining funds.\n\nSigners:\n\nNick: nickdodson.eth\nBenbodhi: signed.benbodhi.eth\nJuan: juanx.eth\nJoshuaFisher: joshuafisher.eth\nToadyHawk: toadyhawk.eth\n\n\n## Proposed Transactions\n\n0x55d1f4091Ced357cD4C4F9dd12531b8fDBe2dd26.transfer(\n    60.0 ETH\n)"},{"blockNumber":16179759,"blockHash":"0xa41c76033014a8af351f37b4690a94d45fe25dbb37e86535cbb28a47594a9167","transactionIndex":70,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xa3443cb30d226354eda121b1b0e6b37c1aed8050f6013e141305a8b878c24db5","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":189,"proposer":"0x387a161C6b25aA854100aBaED39274e51aaffffd","targets":["0x0658f4eD17289144717713ADfFC2539eF7c2EF8e"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":16194159,"endBlock":16230159,"description":"# Extremely nounish\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0jlR9rL.gif)\n\n## 💸 Requesting 694.20 ETH to cross the chasm\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4S66vhJ.png)\n\nLet's scale the provision of extremely nounish public goods through culturally relevant activations.

For example, the giant noggles you've seen people skating are permanently installed in Rio de Janeiro at Praça XV, alongside other iconic urban sculptures installed each year by Coletivo XV.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uOAnnqd.png)\n\nOur giant noggles are in the same town square as the giant skateboard, one of the most photographed landmarks in Rio, third only to Christ the Redeemer and Sugar Loaf which are both globally recognisable.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/H5xaVey.png)](https://twitter.com/0xigami/status/1598537522141069312)\n\nThe ability to do more activations like what we've seen in Brazil depends on the roll-out of the greatest onboarding effort Nouns has ever seen. Let's explore some of the ways we plan on scaling:\n\n### Builder onboarding via seasonal Prop House rounds\n\nGnars DAO has attracted builders who've paved the way with their creative approaches to activating their communities. Many hail from emerging markets where we can have an outsized impact and their values are already closely aligned with ours as crypto natives.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uYMx45z.png)\n\n[Prop House](https://prop.house) allows us to run mandated funding rounds each season that will see builders competing for the opportunity to uplift their respective communities. Each round will fund activations as described below and we've already received expressions of interest from suitable candidates throughout South America, Africa, Asia and more.\n\n### Public goods delivery through builder-led activations\n\nBuilders funded each round will be equipped with everything they need for public goods delivery through thoughtful and culturally relevant activations. Leaning on our experience in Brazil, we'll help motivated individuals become local heroes.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/56iuFKh.gif)\n\nOur community will help them to implement nounish obstacles, crypto wallets and NFTs (10% of Gnars are for onboarding), merch and stickers, photo walls and banners, and to receive delivery of remuneration, Noun 189 skateboards and various types of noggles.\n\n### Hashtag campaigns to catalyse social media curation\n\nWe're not looking for \"[flash in the pan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flash_in_the_pan)\" type events and are committed to the pursuit of the \"[nouns virtuous cycle](https://medium.com/@punk4156/the-nouns-virtuous-cycle-95586bb9c7c9).\" We will leverage hashtags like **#ThatsGnarly** across all platforms to launch ongoing crowd-sourced social media campaigns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/B82OcJz.jpg)\n\nSuch a rudimentary approach removes all barriers to entry so that the first step in joining the movement is simply posting to a hashtag. We can meet newcomers where they already express themselves, curate the best content based on impact and prepare creators for [a Web3 revolution](https://thatsgnar.ly).\n\n### Creator onboarding to the Gnars Revolution protocol\n\n[Revolution](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution) is a protocol from [House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.xyz) (and [gnars.house](https://gnars.house/)) designed to enable the earning of governance rights through contributions other than capital. We are working closely with the team to give Gnars holders a reddit-like curatorial experience for content submitted to #ThatsGnarly.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wCsJkxJ.jpg)\n\nContent surfaces on a Web3 leaderboard at [thatsgnar.ly](https://thatsgnar.ly) after being submitted by extreme sports creators across social media. Competing in the \"gnarketplace\" for attention, top performing content is minted and sold as NBA Topshot style NFTs in daily auctions – *ie. Prop House for tricks.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fxNEx13.jpg)\n\n*Trick NFTs released under CC0, Gnars NFTs drawn from 10% of supply already allocated to athlete/artist onboarding and each GNAR is equal to one Gnars DAO governance vote.*\n\n## 🚀 How we'll spend 694.20 ETH\n\nWe're a passionate community with domain expertise who know very well the agility required to succeed. Our plans are subject to change and funds will be disbursed through our own proven governance, but this should give you some idea of what to expect:\n\n### Activations\n\nSkateboard production and shipping, existing skate park refurbishments, localised merchandise production, Nouns Vision and Bigshot noggles, fabrication of more giant noggles and so much more.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XQ5qksI.jpg)\n\n*Additional locations where sculpture installation is not allowed will be activated using NFC enabled \"⌐◨-◨\" beacons that prompt visitors to get involved.* \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2OGWJ1z.jpg)\n\n*This is a rough mockup of small indestructible noggle fixtures that can be glued discreetly at existing spots without degrading an obstacle's user experience.*\n\n### Autonomy\n\nSince inception, our community have had access to Noun 189 in order to participate in Nouns DAO governance. The time has come for Gnars DAO to acquire two Nouns of their own. Enough funds to purchase 2 Nouns will be allocated to auction bidding.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vD0S5Ty.gif)\n\nAdditional funds from our ongoing NFT auctions will bolster this funding request, further efforts laid out in this proposal, and allow us to continue onboarding professional team riders who represent us throughout their respective industries as ambassadors.\n\n### Contributors\n\nAs required we will provide remuneration through governance to top notch contributors already attracted to Gnars including [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami), [Alberto](https://twitter.com/alberto_campora), [Akva](https://twitter.com/Akva556), [Vlad](https://twitter.com/vladhzc), [Sam Mason de Caires](https://twitter.com/sammdec), [Brian](https://twitter.com/pbrianandj), [Rocketman](https://twitter.com/rocketman_w), [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi), [Davin](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye), [Satori](https://twitter.com/0xSatori), [Lochie](https://twitter.com/lochieaxon) and [Knowhow92](https://twitter.com/theocharis_ch). We will approach these engagements on a competitive basis much like our activations. \n\nWe've been working hard to gain qualitative insight and to establish the most effective operational structure. As a community we have access to unrivalled industry expertise through our relationships with pro athletes, artists, media and brands. We look forward to inspiring many more of our connections through the very same thing that's gotten us to where we are – word of mouth.\n\n> 📝 **NOTE:** Funding receival to

This is Nouns — The First Edition minted by Nouns\n\n[![Ordinary Folk Reel](https://i.imgur.com/uSC0HEl.jpg)](https://zora-prod.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeicnztdctxucbqbpm2m6mghjw6nv4n4opnev4hmftoxk5moykuayeq)\n---\nFollowing the overwhelmingly positive response to the Nouns Explainer created by **Ordinary Folk from [Prop 113](https://nouns.wtf/vote/113)**, we are proposing that Nouns releases this video as a timed open edition.\n\nThis is a groundbreaking proposal, as it will be the first time that Nouns DAO will be minting and releasing a creative work that was commissioned by the DAO.\n\nBy minting this video from the DAO via a proposal, it is becoming NounsDAO canon. Similar to how the DAO added in [new head attributes](https://nouns.wtf/vote/125) via a proposal, Nouns can continue to explore and experiment with new models of CC0 art and production and minting directly from the DAO is a new tool for the organization to directly release and distribute the most important artifacts from the community. It’s not hard to see how this can advance Nouns into a crypto-native form of Movie Studio, Production House, Art Museum and so on.\n\nThis video will be released as a Timed Open Edition for a price of 0.05 ETH. This means it will be available for anyone to mint for the specified minting period, which will be open until the Rose Parade on January 2nd, 2023. The proceeds from sale will be split between Nouns (60%) and Ordinary Folk (40%).\n\nWe are excited to experiment with DAO NFT releases as an additional value capture mechanism, and potentially create a simple and repeatable model for any creator, community and brand in the ecosystem to put forward amazing artifacts to be minted via Nouns.\n\nThis edition will be minted with [Zora](https://zora.co), and will be available to mint onchain and at [thisisnouns.wtf](https://thisisnouns.wtf)\n\n# Release Details:\n\n**Title:** This is Nouns\n\n**Description:** WTF is Nouns? That’s the question we sought to answer in this crazy video – packing in more artistic styles than we’ve ever put into a project before, and a sprinkling of humour along the way.\n\nThis is Nouns is the first ever edition mint by NounsDAO, created by Ordinary Folk.\n\n⌐◨-◨ \n\n**Symbol:** NOUN001\n\n**Edition Type:** Timed Open Edition\n\n**Start date:** December 23rd, 12pm ET \n**End date:** January 2nd, 12pm ET\n\n**Price:** 0.05 ETH\n\n**Split address:**\n0xCF8AEFd3E895005C37BB7A901C1a8B253684A012\n\n**Ordinary Folk Address**\n0x93629A45bB87C4518cB98Dbd97e016136e89Ce71\n\n**NounsDAO Treasury Address**\n0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10\n\n---\n###### *tranqui.eth (ZORA engineer) is set as collection defaultAdmin to update any potentially issues with metadata + salesConfig upon contract deploy and will then transfer ownership to NounsDAO Treasury Address when finalized.*"},{"blockNumber":16195070,"blockHash":"0x140b9fdb368361285558afb63dced0e91f994c36cca2138fd024afeae14d1f63","transactionIndex":106,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x5460f4c50aeb5a4de91e3b58114a8c295e8777d448cbb4812a45c2638a09c1bd","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":191,"proposer":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","targets":["0xCb2D68C9e7194B9cE0837eE5E676e796CB31C55a","0x86b1eAf8Db027A145595b4602b0Dd19f77Cfa1Fd"],"signatures":["",""],"calldatas":["0x","0x"],"startBlock":16209470,"endBlock":16245470,"description":"# Nouns Love v1.0 / Mucho Love v1.25\n\n## **tl;dr**\n-   Mucho Love is a nounish social impact platform that follows a “see good, do good” format that began operating 6 months ago.\n-   Nouns Love aims to be a platform that uses content from social impact, public goods, and charitable efforts to expand Nouns through social media content creation and storytelling.\n-   The platform will increase brand equity by building a positive association of the ⌐◧-◧ in a widespread audience.\n-   Nouns Love will have international communities in Uganda, Mexico, Germany, and Spain test the framework’s adaptability.\n-   Some of the planned activations in the Dominican Republic include cooking 100 children’s dream meals, giving free haircuts and essentials to an entire community, and building a house that got destroyed by Hurricane Fiona.\n-   Development of a Nouns Love toolkit, creating a framework that can be used by other communities for smoother activations.\n-   The proposal requests funding for a 4-month extension to establish Nouns Love as a fully functional platform and keep growing Mucho Love in the DR for further experimentation.\n\n### What is Mucho Love?\n\n\n**Mucho Love is a social impact platform that follows a “see good, do good” format.**  \nML uses social impact activations and content creation/distribution to proliferate ⌐◧-◧ .\n\n**It began in Lil Nouns on prop.house** ([https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-3/655](https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-3/655)) **and then went on-chain**.

The power that **see good, do good** content has is too big to let it go to waste. So far, Nouns has been one of the most successful projects at integrating IRL to web3 impact.\n\nShowing everyone how a community can come together to help others and cooperate with each other, **a community connected by ⌐◨-◨**, is an excellent way to noun-pill newcomers.\n\nThis is where _**Nouns Love**_ comes in.\n\n![nounslove](https://i.imgur.com/Zo86psu.png)\n\n### What is Nouns Love?\nNouns Love is born from the interest of the Mucho Love’s team to **develop a global platform that uses content from social impact, public goods, charitable efforts to leverage the expansion of Nouns through social media content creation and storytelling**. Nouns Love will focus on in-real-life impact activations and public goods generated by the Nounish community.\n\nThe power that **see good, do good** content has is too big to let it go to waste. So far, Nouns has been one of the most successful projects at integrating IRL to web3 impact.\n\n**Nouns Love will increase brand equity by building a positive association with the brand in a widespread audience**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4lw5YK7.jpg)\n\n### Transitioning to _Nouns Love_\nWe will start transitioning from Mucho Love to Nouns Love. Mucho Love will stay as a branch of Nouns Love for further social impact experimentation, public interaction, and testing ground of new ideas in the DR.\n\n**Nouns Love** aims to become a branch of Nouns that focuses on using storytelling, different narratives, and high-quality IRL content creation, which with the **see good, do good** content format **will expand Nouns to a global audience**.\n\nBy the end of the 4-month extension Nouns Love aims to be established as a fully functional platform.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5j9RvTb.jpg)\n\n### Mucho Love and international communities\nInternational communities will be using the model created by Mucho Love for its activations to test its adaptability. This will allow to take into account the inherent differences between countries, cultures, societal structures that exist throughout the world.\n\n**The communities that will test the model**:  \n◨ Uganda - led by Davin ([https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye))  \n◨ Mexico - led by Mono & Ale ([https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos))  \n◨ Germany - led by bk ([https://twitter.com/0xbk_](https://twitter.com/0xbk_))  \n◨ Spain - led by BlakeNeit ([https://twitter.com/blakeneit](https://twitter.com/blakeneit))\n\n**DR activations**:\n-   Knife RD x Mucho Love - “We cooked 100 children’s dream meals” ([https://www.instagram.com/kniferd/](https://www.instagram.com/kniferd/))\n-   Giving an entire community free hair cuts and essentials\n-   @sunsetco.rd x Mucho Love - “We took 10 families to see the beach for the first time” ([https://www.instagram.com/sunsetco.rd/](https://www.instagram.com/sunsetco.rd/))\n-   Techo RD x Mucho Love - [https://rd.techo.org/](https://rd.techo.org/) - Building a house for a family that lost it all to Hurricane Fiona\n-   Hugo Mendoza Children’s Hospital x Mucho Love ([https://hospitalhugomendoza.gob.do/](https://hospitalhugomendoza.gob.do/))\n\n**International activations**:\n-   A refugee dedicated to preserving the endangered Mexican donkey\n-   A volunteering event that will hand out food to homeless people around the city.\n-   A child care center for orphans and abandoned children to donate clothes, nounish educational materials such as books and pencils, toys, and dry stock food hampers.\n-   A city clean-up activation volunteering event.\n\n### Content creation and distribution\n**Every public good, social impact, and charitable effort has a unique narrative**. Through storytelling, all of these narrative can portray what it means to be nounish. Nouns Love will have its own in-house marketing team **to develop unique narratives through captivating, “see good, do good” style videos**.\n\n**The amount of raw content that can be produced from public goods, charitable efforts, social impact is immense**. The marketing team will receive raw content to produce high-quality content for social media distribution. The team will have constant brainstorming sessions with international community leads to deeply understand the particular narratives of every activation done.\n\nContent creation was one of the biggest challenges that Mucho Love faced, not having our own team that could develop our ideas, concepts, and styles was a huge limiting factor on our social media content capacity. **NL’s in-house team will allow us to 5x our content creation capabilities**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZjHKKHM.jpg)\n\n### Development of a flexible framework\nDuring the past 6 months of activations, Mucho Love has made mistakes, created solutions, and changed formats. The amount of time lost by Mucho Love’s starting inefficiencies is very significant. Time-efficiency is the reason why we decided to develop a flexible framework for public goods, charitable efforts, and social impact.\n\n**A flexible framework that allows for better, smoother activations, therefore saving time.** The framework will take into account many minor details that may be overlooked which can lead to a poor activation and overall experience.\n\n**This framework will be tested by our international communities** that will be performing social impact activations during the following 4 months.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UvXE2KN.png)\n\n### Global synchronous activations\n**A global synchronous activation is an activity performed by many different communities that form the Nounish ecosystem in a certain time period**. These activations will target the same issue/activity and produce raw content for content creation.\n\nBy providing a platform for people to connect and interact in real time, global synchronous activities **can help to build relationships and foster a sense of belonging among members of a community**.\n\n**Nouns Love aims to portray the amazing work being done by nounish communities all around the world**. With storytelling, content creation, narratives, and marketing allowing Nouns to reach a wide audience.\n\nBy removing all barriers of crypto, web3, creating a wallet, discord, different websites, twitter, **see good, do good content** will be able to transcend as far as many hearts it touches in its path. Additionally, global synchronous activities will help build momentum and enthusiasm for a particular cause or issue, driving up engagement and participation within the community.\n\n### Social media & content distribution\n**We aim to expand Nouns Love to**:  \n◨ Youtube: Mid-length video format striving to combine storytelling with good animations, edits, and clips that will lead to the production of family-friendly, shareable, “see good, do good.” content.  \n◨ Tiktok: Short video formats with catchy hooks with the main point of spreading the ⌐◧-◧s through the platform. Making it easier for people who find the ⌐◧-◧s interesting to click the profile and access other social media where more information will be more easily found (Instagram, Youtube).  \n◨ Instagram: So far, Instagram has worked for us pretty well. A few flops and one fantastic post (a post with 67,000 likes), but it’s been great in general. Instagram will be the “face” of what NL stands for, does, and activates. We’ll also be using challenge formats to engage more people.  \n◨ Twitter: We’ll be using Twitter to make updates like “Today, Nouns Love donated 100 football kits powered by ⌐◧-◧”.\n\n**Combining youtube’s storytelling capabilities through mid-length content that engages viewers, TikTok’s short-form video with hooks that captivate the attention to the noggles, and Instagram as the face of NL, we believe that it’ll be only a matter of time & effort for us to reach substantially good levels in all these platforms**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/a7I8VN1.jpg)\n\n### Budget Breakdown\n\n#### Social Impact Fund 84 ETH\n\n-   5 activations in the Dominican Republic (Mucho Love) (46.5 ETH)\n    -   Transportation, uniforms, volunteers activity, and third parties (6.5 ETH)\n-   4 pilot activations by international communities (16 ETH)\n-   1 synchronous international activation in all 5 countries (15 ETH)\n\n#### Marketing & Content Creation Team 39 ETH\n-   Video Editor\n-   Social Media Manager\n-   Animator/Illustrator\n-   Photographer/Videographer\n\n#### 16 ETH\n-   Retro-funding compensation for 4 core team members who have worked on Mucho Love for the last four months.

Bring the expertise of a Pixar veteran to the Nouns ecosystem enabling us to create a foundational animated short story & proliferate the meme!\n\n\n[Check out the proposal trailer!](https://twitter.com/3D_PrintGuy/status/1604906537184792576)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/V58xsIR.jpg)\n\n**Wait, what is Atrium?**\nAtrium.art is a crypto-native network of independent artists and creators. Disciplines represented on Atrium currently include Screenwriting, Animation, Concept Art, Voice Actors, and Music production. Together, creatives on Atrium bring experience from Pixar, Marvel, Luma Pictures, Sony, Netflix and many more.\n\n> You can see the work of Artists on Atrium [here](https://atrium.art/)\n\nSimply put, Atrium is a way to easily piece together veteran talent to produce cinematic content.\n\n**So … What is this animated Lore?**\nNouns are cc0 identities coming forth one day at a time. While there have been explainer videos done via [113](https://nouns.wtf/vote/113) and open video content proposals (explainers) via [181](https://nouns.wtf/vote/181), We want to create an engaging cinematic introduction to the world of nouns. One that reflects the original intent behind the emergence of Nouns DAO, a story that shows who nouns are, what they have been up to, and a nod to future plans. A tale that leaves the audience curious, engaged, and wanting for more.\n\nWe believe this animation will serve as a foundation to build an expansive storyworld on top of nouns cc0 IP. Where any noun could go beyond the core nouns audience and have a viewership across different communities native to crypto and beyond.\n\n**Who is the creator behind this first story?**\nHaving a creator who understands the NFT space, the broader story, and cinematic culture is important when developing content to serve as a landing page for Nouns. We believe that 3D Print Guy is uniquely equipped in style, storytelling and understanding to provide a memorable rendition of the values and beliefs behind nouns.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rmzvlQT.jpg)\n\nWith over 2 decades of experience in the business, including working on films like Up, he has been tugging on your heart strings over many years. His youtube page has content eclipsing 45 million views and his characters and plots have shown the ability to capture the world’s attention. He has also demonstrated an ability to release relevant content based on trending topics as seen with his most recent animation about [ChatGPT](https://twitter.com/3D_PrintGuy/status/1600116597711990784) (5k+ likes, 77k+ video views on twitter).\n\nQuick Links about 3D Print Guy -\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/3DPrintGuyChannel)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/3D_PrintGuy)\n\nIn 2022 alone he has produced 15 min of animation both in longer formats and short viral clips, with sound design and VFX all done in house. In 2023, we hope to have the opportunity to help proliferate the nouns as well.\n\nSome of the Highlights of 3D Print Guy’s independent work\n\n[Imposter Origins: Among Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpCrmbP-Dfs&ab_channel=3DPrintGuy)\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/e/eea1fe1b1a05d83b75e4260ea6e9a44c654ae275_2_1264x514.jpeg)\n30+ mil views between Part 1 and Part 2\n\n[Sixstrings: Commissioned Non-canon BAYC Story](https://twitter.com/siixstrings/status/1554875246049722370)\n\n**Process at Atrium**\nThe entire process is a feedback loop. We would be creating a special channel on the Atrium discord server where Nouners are welcome to join and follow along the milestones of the process.\n\nWe would love to have at least one nounder to engage in conversation so that the story stays loosely true to the canon if any.\n\n* The workflow starts with defining the script and dialogs (if any) for the story. This involves defining shot by shot verbatim descriptions of what is happening on screen. A good story is a great script in the first step.\n* After the script is done, we start to look for Voice actors who will help narrate / engage in dialog based on the script. If the script doesn’t have any dialogs and is mostly visually expressive we skip this step.\n* Now the fun part begins where you start to model the characters, the environment, the objects in the scene. Rigging a model is technically intensive process and better rigged models are more equipped for better emotions during a scene (more fluid and organic movements)\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/e/e4408f0a1790f89fa248ea6aa9d233881580b665_2_522x518.jpeg)\n* Once you have the 3d assets ready - you start the process of Look-Dev. Look development in CG means you start to give definition to the model through textures, lighting, colours etc. They start to come to life.\n* Animatic essentially lets you block out part by part of the story sequence with actual scene setup (the animation is not smooth and done yet but essentially simulates the storyboard).\n* Using the animatic, Sound design can start to happen.\n* We will review the animatic and invite feedback to the animatic via our communication channel.\n* Once the animatic is locked down, the final animation work begins. This is the most intensive and time consuming process and takes the bulk of the later half of the creation cycle.\n* After final animation is done - it is time for last visual effects, lighting passes, refinements before you start to map out the finished sound design artefacts as well as the dialogs.\n* And then the final Reveal of the output (examples shared above). Final Output to premiere both on Twitter as well as youtube.\n\nWe will be utilising the Story’s reach in terms of reshares / likes / social engagement as metrics for success.\n\n**Ask / Cost**\n\nAll inclusive production cost is proposed to be 20 ETH. (Transferred to the Atrium Multi-sig upon execution)\n\nThings covered included\n\n* Storyboarding, Scripting\n* Multiple character plotline (3d Modelling)\n* In 3d animation, cost ramps up as you animate more than one character in a scene + dialog work\n* Voice Over + Sound design\n* Animation\n* Final FX\n\n> We will also be including the main characters 3d files (rigged) available for download and re-use under cc0.\n\n\n**Production Schedule**\nPost the proposal execution, we will look at a final production duration of about 6-8 weeks of the above process.\n\n\nWe will be coordinating the comms and logistics through out the whole process alongside 3dPrintGuy.

This global game is NOT gambling. It’s a peer-to-peer platform where fans challenge each other to test their sports knowledge. It’s where trivia meets March Madness, but for every sport and every Nouner. Nouners will participate against each other in fun, easy, and simple-to-play daily contests across all major sports leagues. Here’s how to play:\n \n### Players join and get a free game credit. \n![](https://i.imgur.com/Je5UNvw.png)\n### Contesting will be available in major global sports leagues, with new leagues being added on demand.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LuODrnj.png)\n### Players choose a contest of their choice\n![](https://i.imgur.com/99eWvk7.png)\n### Players choose a winner of every game in the contest and earn points for each correct selection\n![](https://i.imgur.com/D3W6oIW.png) \n### The more points they earn the higher the prize\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yxWRgS4.png) \n\n\n# Proliferating The Nouns\nSports is a global passion, integrated within every Web2 and Web3 community. However, the bridge between these two groups has always been a challenge. When it comes to understanding Web3, Web2 users simply don’t know where to start. It’s up to Web3 projects to create resources that are immediately useful to them; Noun Sports Pick’Em™ is designed to do exactly that. This game cultivates an audience of Web2 sports fans in one place by providing a fun, inclusive, daily sports game.\n\nOnce the user has been registered, the game is designed to develop their interest in Web3, specifically the Nouns. In addition to the game’s Nouns branding, there are several key user journeys that will proliferate the Nouns.\n1.\t**NFT Prizes:** Many of the prizes will be NFTs and the dollar values will be shown. When Web2 users see the monetary value tied to the asset, they will be far more inclined to learn about NFTs. ***We will prioritize prizing from the Nouniverse ecosystem***\n2.\t**Nouns Updates:** Users will receive regular updates through e-mail and push notifications about other Nouns projects. There will be a page on the App where they can learn more about these projects.\n3.\t**Daily Facts:** Everyday there will be a brief Noun fact pop-up that users will see when they first open the App. Users can click “Explore Nouns” to be redirected to the Nouns Encyclopedia. \n4.\t**Weekly Voting:** Every week, users can vote on which prize they want the following week. Showing the various NFT utility (many of which will be sports related) will educate users on the Web3 space. On this page, users can click to learn more about the Nouns DAO and voting as well.\n5.\t**Nouns Encyclopedia:** Across the App there will be prompts for users to click “Nouns Encyclopedia” which will be a complete guide to the Nouns. Users will be provided with direct links the Nouns native site\n\n### A subsection of the app titled “Nouns Encyclopedia” will be a resource centre for players to learn about Nouns and NFT’s \n![](https://i.imgur.com/F7D7VjC.png)\n### In app messaging will provide players with interesting facts about the Nouns, Nouns DAO, and NFT’s \n![](https://i.imgur.com/7udQWRo.png)\n### Players will be notified on the app when a new Noun has been minted and provided with a redirect to the Nouns website to bid on future Nouns \n![](https://i.imgur.com/Stky4Ov.png)\n### Bounty will offer NFTs as contest grand prizes, and players will have the ability to vote on which NFT prize they’d like to play for \n![](https://i.imgur.com/ApqbmiW.png)\n\n\n# Our Team & Purpose:\n\nWe are Bounty Sports; a passionate group of sports fans who have worked tirelessly over the last two years to build Bounty.

Diversity in strategy ensures the diversity of the audience and maximum reach of the Nouns community. The marketing budget was determined so that Noun Sports Pick’Em™ can acquire 10,000 users in its first year and reach a total audience of over 57,000,000 sports fans globally. The campaigns will also include several Web3 influencers, events, and channels to acquire sports fans within the Web3 community as well. Marketing strategies include the following:\n\n1.\t**Influencers** (YouTube & Twitch)  - We will work with a vast network of YouTube / Twitch streamers (primarily e-sports and sporting news content creators) to promote Nouns Sports Pick’Em™ and migrate their audiences to the platform\n2.\t**Paid Media** – We will run targeted interactive media ads via ad publishing networks\n3.\t**Podcasts** – We will partner and become a staple on various sports centric and NFT-focused podcasts to grow the Nouns Sports Pick’Em™ brand reach and total impressions\n4.\t**Referral/Organic** – We will develop a robust referral program, where Nouners and new players can refer their networks to earn game credits, prizes, tickets, and more\n5.\t **Conferences & Events** – We will be an active participant at various NFT and Sports conferences alike, to deliver on the ground promotion of Nouns Sports Pick’Em™\n\n\n# **Monetization & Project Longevity**\n\nNouns Sports Pick’Em™ generates revenue by taking a 10% rake on paid contests, which allows the game to operate in perpetuity. Revenue generated will fund prizing and marketing in Year 2, and beyond. All excess funds will be used towards purchasing Nouns and other relevant sports NFTs, which will be layered in as additional prizes within the game. Bounty Sports is also committed to sponsoring other Nouners’ projects to grow our own game and re-invest in the Noun community. \n\n\n\n# **FAQ About Proposal**\n\n**Q:** Is this sports betting?\n**A:** No! This game format is considered a “game of skill”. There is no “house”, and all contests are run as peer-to-peer competitions. In essence, it’s a form of sports trivia. \n\n**Q:** Will Nouns Sports Pick’Em™ have e-sports?\n**A:** Absolutely. E-sports will be significant focus for Nouns Sports Pick’Em™, understanding it’s one of the shared bridges between Web2 and Web3 communities.\n\n**Q:** Is this a free-to-play (FTP) or pay-to-play (P2P) game?\n**A:** Both. To be inclusive and ensure everyone can play, the F2P game will be available globally. We will also offer a P2P game for users that want to compete with their own currency to win cash prizes. \n\n**Q:** How is the game monetized?\n**A:** The F2P game is not monetized, it’s FREE! The P2P game takes a 10% commission on the prize pool. For example: 100 users @ Ξ 0.10 = Ξ 9.00 prize pool + Ξ 1.00 commission to Nouns Sports Pick’Em™. The commissions will go towards funding future F2P prizes and marketing, so the game will run in perpetuity!\n\n\n**Q:** Will the game accept crypto deposits & withdrawals?\n**A:** Of course!\n\n\n**Q:** Is this a Web2 game or a Web3 game?\n**A:** This is a Web2 game. You don’t need a Noun or any other NFT to sign-up and play. The objective is to capture a widescale Web2 sports audience, as well as sports fans in Web3, and educate them on the Nouns.\n\n**Q:** How do you build the Nouns name among Web2 users?\n**A:** The Nouns Sports Pick’Em™ will be marketed to a Web2 audience through traditional marketing channels. Once on the platform, user engagement will be optimized to educate users. The game will leverage, giveaways, gamification, and regular communication to bring attention to the Nouns community.\n\n**Q:** Will Bounty integrate its existing audience into the Noun Sports Pick’Em™?\n**A:** Yes! Bounty has 20,000 active players. Through the F2P game, they’ll have opportunities to win prizes, and be directed to the Nouns ecosystem. \n\n**Q:** What will Luke Rockhold’s involvement be on this project?\n**A:** Bounty has unlimited worldwide use of Luke’s name, image, and likeness. We will leave it to the Nouns community to decide if, when, and how they’d like to leverage this resource within the project.

Danit will introduce them to Nouns and tell them about the opportunity to build on top of the protocol.  \n\t* The collection's exhibition area is going to be a custom built interactive experience. It will include an AR installation and holograms representing the collection & Nouns.\n* **Showcase the collection in future events, museums, and galleries. Use this collection to introduce Nouns to new audiences.**\n\t* Danit will make the collection available to show in future events where Nouns have presence (like NFT NYC, NFT Aus, ETH Bogota/SF etc.)\n\t* Danit will (and has already started) introduce Nouns at her lectures in various events, e.g. at a recent workshop for executives at a very large luxury multinational corp.\n* **Who is Danit**?\n\t* Danit is one of the world's leading experts & innovators in 3D-printed clothes and textiles.\n\t* Her [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/danit_peleg_forget_shopping_soon_you_ll_download_your_new_clothes) received more than 2M views. \n\t* Danit's past work has been in the [Opening Ceremony of the 2016 Rio Paralympics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFEBaJWzER8), Triannale di Milano, Maker Faire, The National Center for Craft & Design, The Franklin Institute, Landesmuseum Württemberg Stuttgart.. and many more\n*  **This prop is for the last milestones of the Nouns 3D-printed collection.

Not unlike Nouns, it's at the intersection of art, culture & tech. \n*  The tech being so new, and the visuals so striking, 3D-printed clothes and textiles get a lot of attention. The collection is eye-catching and different. It can be used to attract attention at various events. \n*  Fashion executives, especially in the innovation departments of big brands, are always on the lookout for the next thing. Through this collection nouns will stand out and help future potential brands learn about the opportunity to build on this open-source brand!\n* It's also just very nounish: pushing the boundaries of fashion in an authentic way.\n---\n\n### What does this proposal include?\n\n* Finish modeling and printing 5 looks.\n* Attending NFT Paris with a custom-built exhibition space, in a magnificent historic location, the Grand Palais.\n\n### Why combine finalizing the collection with the NFT Paris event? \n* Since it's physical, I want the collection to get exposure and eyeballs IRL. This event has the perfect audience and location. It is very fashion-oriented and is an NFT event.  \n\n\n### Progress since my last proposal:\n\n* Participated in the first [metaverse fashion week](https://twitter.com/danitpeleg3d/status/1508118881570897927) with the Nouns collection\n* 90% finished Patternmaking, Modeling, and Rendering all the looks.\n* Printed the first garment in Polyjet: the “king” dress and assembled it.\n* Started making a special Nouns filament for printing with FDM tech.\n\n\n### Progress on Roadmap:\n\n1. ☑ **Research** - Inspiration board, material research, printing samples\n2. ☑ **Design** - sketches\n3. ☑ **Patternmaking/Rendering/Modeling** - 3D modeling the sketches into 3D-printable files\n4. ☑ **Print Testing** - testing many different types of printers, configurations, materials etc\n5. ☑ **Participate in Metaverse Fashion Week (MVFW)**\n6. **STARTED: Printing finals** - printing the entire collection\n7. **STARTED: Assembling** - using different techniques (e.g. gluing, knotting, etc) to assemble the collection together\n8. **Photoshoot (with real-life models)** - for press materials, websites, AR filter etc\n9. **NEW: Showcase collection at NFT Paris** - Invited & will have a booth and interactive AR display\n10. **Marketing** - prepare press kit. The collection gets PR, is booked for events, and showcases galleries & museums\n\n## Some images from my progress:\n\n### The collection's sketches\n[![image-1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/CKxgm5tJ/image-1.png)](https://postimg.cc/FY88KrhJ)\n\n### Washing the printed king dress\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-26-26.png](https://i.postimg.cc/hGYC7LSc/Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-26-26.png)](https://postimg.cc/QBpg2W9y)\n\n[![image-2.png](https://i.postimg.cc/cCnpzndy/image-2.png)](https://postimg.cc/p5Pchy9q)\n\n### Assembling the top of this look\n\n[![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/rsPcrkgg/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/p5z3w3wn)\n\n\n---\n\n## Showcasing at NFT Paris\n\n### The event\n\n\n* [NFT Paris](https://www.nftparis.xyz/) will take place on February 24-25, 2023.

The installation will be segmented into different activations.\n\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-11-22-20.png](https://i.postimg.cc/4NRxnjtq/Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-11-22-20.png)](https://postimg.cc/z3prctxF)\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-11-25-11.png](https://i.postimg.cc/fTVfTtcB/Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-11-25-11.png)](https://postimg.cc/nCtD3LwD)\n\n\n\n1. **AR experience mannequin:** this centred piece will be used as a support for attendees to enjoy digital fashion pieces with Augmented Reality\n\n[![Screen-Recording-2022-12-19-at-11-29-52.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/rpzkh27h/Screen-Recording-2022-12-19-at-11-29-52.gif)](https://postimg.cc/xkrhChfH)\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-12-06.png](https://i.postimg.cc/LsxSd14P/Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-12-06.png)](https://postimg.cc/zLH6K3gD)\n\n2. **LED 56cm fans:** these fans will create holographic fashion pieces from the collection\n\n\n[![fans.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/50QBc85K/fans.gif)](https://postimg.cc/LYRYLYbj)\n\n3. **POP3 holographic displays:** this digital display solution will recreate an entire digital fashion show by designing a digital catwalk on which both avatars and nouns will be brought to life\n\n[![pop3.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/jqN1PfVh/pop3.gif)](https://postimg.cc/PNXKkP5L)\n\n4. **Mannequin with physical fashion pieces:** this mannequin will be used as support to showcase printed pieces designed by Danit Peleg\n\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-10-07.png](https://i.postimg.cc/gJGxsRS6/Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-10-07.png)](https://postimg.cc/mc6Z2cGb)\n\n5. **Video projector:** the screen will display videos from nounish ⌐◨-◨  (and hopefully a specific video made about my project) to share Nouns stories further and show the different steps of creation/production of the collection. \n\n\n### Additional activations\n\n* 15-minute session to present the collaboration with Nouns\n* 30 tickets to NFT Paris for the community\n\n\n## Budget\n* Finalizing & printing all models and photoshoot: 67,153€\n* NFT Paris & Booth Installation: 50,700€\n* Total ask: 125,457 USDC (117,853€)\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-20-at-10-15-31.png](https://i.postimg.cc/HLVtYQYC/Screen-Shot-2022-12-20-at-10-15-31.png)](https://postimg.cc/McJBtffs)\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-20-at-10-16-51.png](https://i.postimg.cc/66mtTKfJ/Screen-Shot-2022-12-20-at-10-16-51.png)](https://postimg.cc/6TnD1DPY)\n\n\n\n### Timeline\n1. **End of December:** Launch of production.\n3. **Early January:** Construction and assembly of the booth.\n4. **Mid January:** Marketing by NFT Paris.\n5. **January - February:** Finalize collection and photoshoot.\n6. **February 24-25:** NFT Paris!!\n\n\nI can't wait to finish my super nounish collection & bring it to awesome stages around the world!\n THANK YOU for your time and support!!! \n\n[Danit ⌐◨-◨](https://www.instagram.com/danitpeleg3d/)\n\n\nTransactions:\n\n* **To Danit's wallet: 72,547 USDC (68,353 Euro)** to 0x81EB3Fd07d84bD3aa0F4Df1359D87820F4cCbEf9 \n* **To NFT Paris wallet: 52,699 USDC (49,500 Euro)** to 0x48EeB021f2C56d4f8d2A741D2582A679B4C2B87A "},{"blockNumber":16273457,"blockHash":"0x3a80d550a63660d84b7fe3b8cec96dd7d5d2271f8d60bf58b68d06f8e3eac7a3","transactionIndex":100,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x9b31dbe3aa839cfaf17adf68e9bb7a84992b108f4c3cdbe7ed6f40cbd79be165","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":198,"proposer":"0x8b45D1CACcb3593E9F1015BA8e97AFB68DE3a0d1","targets":["0x4b1471ea283C2c2eEef7303155AA7a388281bc69"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":16309457,"endBlock":16345457,"description":"# THE NOUNSVITATIONAL: Tier 1 Esports Event!\n\n*Nouns Esports is submitting this proposal on behalf of [Slacks](https://twitter.com/SirActionSlacks) & [Kyle](https://twitter.com/keepingitkyle) from WePlay Esports.* \n\n### Hello NounsDAO!\n\nWe are Weplay, a globally recognized Esports event company who specialize in creating groundbreaking productions in the world of gaming. From weekly shows with the NFL and top Twitch Streamers, to multi-million dollar Esports events such as the (Emmy Nominated) Dota 2  Animajor, we pride ourselves on making the most memorable and exciting events in Esports. \n\nNow, it's time for Nouns to have one of their very own: THE NOUNSVITATIONAL! \n\n## Please watch our short VIDEO PROPOSAL BELOW! \n\n\n\n[![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pet9rHvlNs](https://i.imgur.com/IQh4GII.png) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhwg_nlX-w)\n\n---\n\n \n Short and sweet: we believe that an Esports event can take Nouns to new heights. We don't want to just show people some Noggles and call it a day - We want to enact a 3 step mass integration program designed around introducing (and integrating) the esports public at large into Web3, Nouns communities, and furthering the Nouns mission.  \n \n \n \n### Introduction \n \n We first learned about Nouns after your fantastic Dota 2 team entered the scene, and we got to know a few of the amazing folks over at the Nouns Esports crew. After doing our research on Nouns, we were impressed to find a group of people who were different from the normal Dota 2 Esports sponsors. In a scene plagued by Betting Companies, Scam Coins, and other nefarious evil-doers, it was refreshing to find a group of people using Crypto in a positive way; One that we would be proud to partner with to spread their message. Weplay prides itself on being the best in our industry and working with the best in their industry, and we believe that this project would be one of those partnerships. \n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/wb1Bub0.jpg)\n\n \n ### What we Offer\n \n What Nouns Proposals have been doing so far is great, but we believe we can do so much more for the growth of Nouns in the eyes of the general public. Many of your successfully executed Proposals in the past have focused on getting the brand of Nouns out there with general advertising methods of simply \"showing the brand\". What we offer is not only brand recognition, but brand integration, on a wide and universal scale. \n \nWe don't just want people to know what Noggles are. We want people to know about the Nouns mission, the point of a DAO, and to get people who have never heard of Crypto or NFT's (even people who actively dislike them) to see the Web3 world in a positive light by having them actively participate in a system designed around an event that we know they want to watch. \n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ay6mRjf.jpg)\n\n \n  ### The 3 Step Plan \n  \n  Our idea is simple: get viewers to come for the Dota, and stay for the Nouns.  ⌐◨-◨\n  \n1. ENTERTAIN\n\nCreating a custom, interesting Dota Tournament structure with a dual purpose of getting as many viewers as possible to watch due to its innovative nature, world class teams, and Dota's best Talent while also subtly introducing them to a DAO structure in a positive way.\n\n2. EDUCATE\n\nOnce they come for the world class Dota, educate them about Nouns with direct, custom created content which Nouns can use forever (Nouns explainers, DAO explainers, Web3 explainers, and even mini-docs about past successful proposals and interviews) which we will play in-between the games to show that Nouns are one of the good guys, and that this system is something they can be a part of\n\n3. INTEGRATE\n\nUsing a POAP system, and focusing on a \"Mini Dota DAO\" designed around people who have no idea what Web3 is or don't even have crypto wallets, we aim to make the \"scary world of crypto\" something that viewers actively participate in both rewarding and fun as they collect Dota 2 themed POAPs during the event. By utilizing in-game systems, viewers can even trade these POAPs for digital cosmetics in Dota 2, giving them real value to the average viewer. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MgG6sMz.gif)\n\n\n  ### The Event\n\n\nThe Nounsvitational will be a world class five-day Dota 2 Tournament featuring ten of the top teams worldwide with the best broadcast talent in the Dota scene held from February 14th to February 18th. This will be a Tier 1 Dota 2 event, and the first LAN in DotA since the International World Championships in October. This will be the long-awaited return of Weplay to the Dota 2 scene (voted best Tournament Organizer in the scene, even surpassing Valve, the game's creator itself), and the first non-traditional Custom Game Mode LAN in several years. Suffice it to say, this event is going to be EXTREMELY hype for the average Dota viewer.\n\nUsing our custom map makers, we will transform the Dota 2 in-game map to be a Nounish playground, full of memes, references, and general Nouns branding so that millions of viewers will see Nouns during the games themselves. Between the games, we will utilize our content creation skills to produce and air custom Nouns video content, which will educate the viewers on Noun's culture, structure, mission, and past projects. \n\nHeld in the Weplay Studio in Los Angeles, we will bring the best teams around the world to play, and invite as many Nouners and Nounsfolk as we can to be part of the audience, for a once in a lifetime exclusive and intimate experience. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jO0BL0g.jpg)\n\n\n### Integrating the General Public to Web3\n\nThe event itself will get people's attention: they will watch for the unique structure and for the world class competition. But our true goal will be to get the viewers to understand and integrate into the Nouns culture while they watch a fantastic event. \n\nOur plan for this is also 3 fold. \n\n1. Traditional Pre-Event marketing of Giveaways, pushing people to join the Nouns Esports Discord, follow the Nouns Social media, and even give away tickets to attend the event live. Combined with the content we create at the event, we will ensure that people WANT to watch the content we provide, so they can understand the \"scary world of crypto\"\n2. Contacting the best artists and creators in Dota to make custom Dota 2 POAP art, which we will give away to viewers who watch the event. This will not only drive up viewership, but with an integrated system where viewers can trade POAPs for in game cosmetic items, chances to win prizes, and other benefits, we will not only subtly introduce the average viewer to the world of NFTs, we will ensure that they have fun doing it and can trade them for real value. \n3. Creating a \"Mini Dota DAO'' prior to the event, which will not only advertise the event during its duration on Reddit and other platforms, but show the general viewers that not all NFT and Web3 projects are \"bad guys\" and that the Nouns protocol is something that is actually cool, using a real tangible example that makes the Dota 2 community a better place. \n\nWe believe that by letting the viewers not just watch the Event, but actively participate in the event with POAP collecting, exchanging, and voting for how to \"better the world of Dota\" with a Nounish DAO system will achieve the greater purpose of the event. Come for the Dota, Stay for the Nouns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DigBHGf.gif)\n\n### How does this Proposal Benefit Nouns? \n\n* All video content created for the event (the explanatory videos, documentary-like series, etc.) and the content from The Nounsvitational itself will be usable by the Nouns community as both \"proof of concepts\" and general media Nouns will be able to use forever. This media, especially explainer videos on what are Nouns, Web3, and DAOs, have great value for future proposal endeavors.  \n* Fantastic way to showcase current and past Nouns projects to first-time viewers in a captive audience. Can use already created media from other successful Proposals and expand on them with interviews from the people that made them happen\n* HUGE viewership and outreach to a variety of new, interested viewers in the world of Esports (a community that has a lot of crossover with Web3 already) in a positive, productive way in a scene that views other projects very negatively \n* Cements the Nouns brand in a very valuable space with tangible, easy to gather data showcasing sign ups, viewers, and active participants for future project proposals\n* Active (and trackable) onboarding of the general public to Web3 ideas and systems in a fun and dynamic way where they feel rewarded and positive about their experience, which is one of Noun's core goals   \n* Growing Nouns communities by incentivizing viewers to join for access to prizes, events, and other incentives along with getting them onboard with the general Nouns ecosystem\n* Come to LA! Nouns holders as well as Nouns community members can come and be part of the audience for the event, meet the players and the Talent, and have the experience of a lifetime! A great reward for your already amazing community members! \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RNEH3Tt.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/WmBYAjm.png)\n\n### Ask and Budget Breakdown\n\nTotal Budget: 799 ETH (at $1200) $958,800\n\nCategorized Breakdown:\n- Prizepool - 166 ETH / ~$200,000\n- Flights, Accommodation, Food for Teams: 171 ETH / $205,200\n- Mini Dota DAO Seeding - 10 ETH / $12,000\n- Customization of Dota 2 Map, In-Game integrations - 40 ETH / $48,000\n- Talent Fees - 55 ETH / $66,000\n- POAP Integrations - 7 ETH / $8400\n- VIP Experience for winning Nouners 10 ETH / $12,000\n- Complete Event Fulfillment (Production, Graphics Design, Stage, Venue, Content, Staffing, Security) - 340 ETH / $408000\n\nFunds would be received by a multi-sig (3/4) and then delivered to Weplay.\n- Brennen (Nouner)\n- Sasquatch (Nounsfolk)\n- Maty (Nounsfolk)\n- Kyle (Weplay Operator)\n\n### Event Timeline\n\nMedia Day: Feb 13\nGroup Stage: Feb 14-Feb 15\nPlayoffs: Feb 16-Feb 18\n\n### About Us\n\nWe are Kyle and Slacks, two prominent Dota 2 talent who also work at Weplay. SirActionSlacks has worked directly with Valve, the creators of Steam and Dota 2 in both Business Development and as an associate producer of The International, the Emmy award-winning 42 million dollar Dota 2 event since 2017. He has also created the only \"Alternate Game Mode\" events in Dota 2 history, including Midas Mode 1 and 2, Elimination Mode, The Captain's Draft Minor, and many others. While not making Dota 2 events, Slacks enjoys playing Dota 2 pubs and hosting/casting at events as Talent. \n\nKyle is also a Dota 2 Talent and former successful professional player who has been working to grow the world of Esports at Weplay behind the scenes on dynamic and groundbreaking productions such as the wildly successful Omega League and Dota 2 Animajor, an official Valve major. Kyle's brother was recently on the Nouns Esports team, and now ironically is on Slack's Dota 2 esports team. \n\nAs for Weplay, It's difficult to describe a company that prides itself on spectacle in a written format, so check out some of our content! \n\n[Augmented Reality Showreel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JvFmuPpaIXUCe8nDQiQLTX36HPdL9BoM/view)\n[2021 General Event Showreel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JvFmuPpaIXUCe8nDQiQLTX36HPdL9BoM/view)\n\n### Thank you! \n\nAs we said, we are big fans of Nouns and everything you are trying to do in the space. We truly believe that this event will not only be incredible for Nouns, but also be a fantastic and unforgettable experience for the people in the Nouns community that join us live, virtually, and the Dota 2 community at large. We hope you will consider our proposal and would love to have any comments, feedback, and suggestions. We want to build this event for you, but also build it WITH you, to make sure we make it as NOUNISH AS POSSIBLE! \n\nThank you\n\nSlacks and Kyle\nWeplay Esports\n\n---\n\n## ADDITIONAL INFO\nStill looking for some more, condensed information? Then please continue reading!\n\n\n### On Dota 2 \n\nCurrently, Dota 2 is the 2nd most played game on Steam, the biggest gaming platform in the world. It reaches a global audience with millions of active players each day, and even more viewers on it's Esports events. \n\nCurrently, Dota 2 is experiencing a resurgence of the most viewers and players since 2013! \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ayuGSsx.png)\n\nWhile most Triple A games and Esports require multi-million dollar fee to enter into the sphere with licensing fees and IP protection, Valve allows anyone to do anything with their games, giving full mod tools to players. This allows us to create a very Nounish event for a game with one of the highest viewership numbers in all of Esports. This event would only be possible in Dota, and Dota is our specialty here at Weplay. \n\nIn terms of reach and scale of viewers, the numbers are hard to come by as China and Russia have viewership data that is not easily accessible, but viewership of top events (such as The International and the Weplay Animajor) can reach into the millions from the English audience alone. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NI7SdaC.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ViAaXH3.png)\n\nFor a full breakdown of the Viewership of Weplay's last event, please [check out this link](https://escharts.com/news/weplay-animajor-stats) \n\n### On the \"Mini Dota DAO\"\n\nWe know the mission of Nouns is to gather together and pool resources to make the world a better place. But, the concept of a DAO and the betterment of society that can be caused their-in is something completely foreign to most people. To help the viewers understand (and subtly advertise the event) we propose creating a \"Mini DAO,\" a system that is modeled after Nouns itself! \n\nThe process is simple. At the start of the event, we announce that we will take a percentage of the prize pool and allocate that money to \"make Dota 2 better.\" Then, we will start a Reddit thread (Dota 2's primary community hub) where people are able to offer suggested Proposals for how to spend that money to make Dota better. During the duration of the tourney we will actively check in on this thread, promote it, and encourage people to add to the charitable donation if they wish for some in-game perks like having messages appear during the game on the in-game map. At the end of the event, we will have a vote and choose which idea the community suggested to allocate funds to and announce the winner. \n\nThe point of this is for the community to be HEAVILY INVESTED in the tournament and the suggestions in the Mini DAO, but more importantly by the end of this promotion they will VERY CLEARLY understand the Nouns structure and mission, without being simply told how it works.

Approximately 560 of those have been sold to individuals.*\n\n[Prop 185](https://nouns.wtf/vote/185), executed recently, assigned 150/500 Nouns Vision Glasses (GLASSES) held in the Nouns DAO Treasury to 3 different groups in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nThe aim of this prop is to distribute 50 of the remaining 350 unassigned GLASSES to Nouners. Each GLASSES is an NFT redeemable for an individual pair of physical glasses.\n\nA custom made site @ [nounsclaims.wtf](http://nounsclaims.wtf) and contract were developed for this prop.  \n\n\n\n# Proposal\n\nOver 550 Nouns have been minted. Given that only 350 GLASSES in the Nouns Treasury have not been earmarked, there aren’t enough GLASSES to assign one to each Noun. Assuming that there were at most 350 Nouners, GLASSES could be distributed 1:1 per Nouner, but such distribution wouldn’t be fair as some Nouners own a disproportionate number of Nouns and thus higher weight in control of assets in the Treasury.\n\nIn addition, it wouldn’t be wise to liquidate all GLASSES in the Treasury, as we might find another good use for them in the future.\n\nHence, this proposal allocates 50 GLASSES to be randomly assigned (with pro-rata probability) and claimable by wallets that hold Nouns at time of distribution. The contract was designed to allow for the creation of multiple claim rounds in order to protect against GLASSES staying unclaimed forever. The claim window was set to 15 days (108,000 blocks). After 15 days have passed, Nouns DAO can pass another prop to compensate for GLASSES that went unclaimed and distribute them randomly again, and even distribute additional GLASSES if desired.\n\n\n![Custom site deployed for this prop at nounsclaims.wtf](https://i.ibb.co/0CVKCGB/Screenshot-2022-12-30-at-1-08-03-PM.png)\n*Custom site deployed for this prop at nounsclaims.wtf*\n\n\n# Technical Details\n\nTo ensure the fairest distribution possible and to make it impossible to game the system, the source of randomness for the distribution algorithm comes from Chainlink’s Verifiable Random Function ([VRF](https://chain.link/vrf)) service. \n\nThe [Nouns DAO Executor](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10) contract was set as the owner of the deployed custom contract, so the distribution trigger can only be pulled by Nouns DAO.\n\nThis is the high level flow:\n\nVoting —> Prop passes —> Prop executes (**) —> Function in NounsVisionVRFDistributor called\n\n—> Chainlink VRF random number requested \n\n—> VRF Coordinator calls back GLASSES distribution function in NounsVisionVRFDistributor\n\n—> Glasses are assigned to wallets that hold Nouns at that moment\n\n—> Noun-holding wallets can claim GLASSES won by the wallet for 15 days\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn addition to serving as a fun distribution mechanism for GLASSES in the treasury, this prop serves as a proof of concept for how other NFTs in the Treasury could be distributed if need-be in the future. \n\nIf this prop is well received and the DAO would like to distribute more than 50 additional GLASSES, I’ll submit a new prop leveraging a more gas-optimized contract that can handle bigger allotments.\n\nAlthough I own 2 Nouns, given that I am not a guaranteed beneficiary of this prop, I will be voting in favor instead of abstaining because I’m interested in seeing the experiment play out.\n\nLet the **🎲** begin.\n\n\n(*) Total number of mints is ~1800; this includes 500 for Nouns DAO, 500 presumably reserved for the special edition disco noggles, and 250 for the team.*\n\n(**) This prop also makes use of the custom contract deployed for Prop 185 (NounsVisionBatchTransfer), made by [9999](https://twitter.com/lastpunk9999). Nouns DAO grants the NounsVisionVRFDistributor contract (custom contract for this prop) an allowance of 50 GLASSES on the NounsVisionBatchTransfer contract."},{"blockNumber":16311404,"blockHash":"0x35858988b3f7ce2ddba2bf7af7f8e46c7940852a9c7c942252bba5065d2cc98b","transactionIndex":35,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xcf1387a5404a8ca9cc5525c1d229d3be87754b1131784757f39b635c86ed797a","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":200,"proposer":"0x0BC607Af865024eFc70DA2374E4552201725ADe6","targets":["0x0BC607Af865024eFc70DA2374E4552201725ADe6"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":16347404,"endBlock":16383404,"description":"# Nouns Mail: A Token-Gated Email Address\n\n_Thank you to Lakshman Sankar and Maksim Stepanenko for delegating Nouns to submit this proposal._\n\n_We would also like to thank Prop House and Nouns voters for their support in [Open Round 13](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round-13/2392). This proposal serves to update the community on our progress and request the remaining funds necessary for the development of Nouns Mail._\n\n## tl;dr\nA token-gated email address for every Nouns holder to pseudonymously communicate and access the rest of the internet.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DpLdRUv.jpg)\n\n\n## The Problem\n\nNouns is the most interesting experiment happening in decentralized governance and community. Yet, large swaths of the internet remain segregated from on-chain identities. Currently, Nouners cannot connect their Ethereum wallets to access Twitter, collaborate on a Figma document, or even engage on the [Nouns forum](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/).\n\nEmail addresses remain a necessity to access most platforms on the internet. Existing email providers do not natively integrate with Nouns identity, compelling Nouns to manually link aspects of their on-chain identity to off-chain platforms.\n\nWe elaborate more on this problem and discuss solutions in [The Identity Gap](https://app.skiff.com/docs/3e5c70ba-ce96-48fb-a6e7-be34b6e6c77e#tFlZDTabPylC4WiIdCQ+dRLfE2ZoWZ/uUrqBlx7cUUM=).\n\n## The Proposal\n\nEvery Nouns owner will be able to claim a unique, token-gated email address under `@nouns.email`, or another domain decided by the DAO. Claiming this email address will be enforced by querying to an Ethereum node verifying ownership of a Noun.\n\n**Use cases**\n\nHere we suggest four initial categories of how our proposal can provide utility for Nouns. Should the proposal be accepted, we hope to assist in building out these use cases — like a weekly email newsletter or a `@nouns.email` domain-gated Figma.\n\nWe encourage the community to suggest additional use cases — Nouns Mail is a primitive that can unlock a Cambrian explosion of creativity.\n\nGreater utility for owning a Noun (through Nouns Mail or otherwise) increases the demand for minting Nouns or paying royalties on secondary transactions, leading to a larger treasury for the DAO.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Egs08Y3.jpg)\n\n\n**Implementation**\n\nNounsDAO allocates a domain to be used as the official email domain for Nouns holders. We suggest `nouns.email` because of its familiarity, but any reasonable domain owned by the DAO or available on the market would suffice.\n\nWe will be using [Skiff Mail](https://skiff.com/mail), an open source, end-to-end encrypted mail provider, as the interface and mailserver for the custom domain.\n\nAll emails sent and received by Nouns email addresses are encrypted with elliptic curve crypto (Curve25519 keypairs), and emails that are sent or received to other Skiff accounts (e.g. other Nouns holders) are end-to-end encrypted. Ownership of EOAs is verified by generating a unique challenge token, requesting an ECSDA signature, and verifying the signature’s validity. A full description of Skiff’s protocol and threat model can be found at [skiff.com/whitepaper](https://skiff.com/whitepaper).\n\nAs previously mentioned, verification of Nouns ownership occur by querying an Ethereum indexer on the [Nouns token contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9c8ff314c9bc7f6e59a9d9225fb22946427edc03?a=0x0bc3807ec262cb779b38d65b38158acc3bfede10#code).\n\n**Example User Experience**\n\nA user connects their wallet — if it’s detected that they own a Noun, a dialog prompts them to create their email address.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XIriCUL.png)\n\nAfter clicking `Claim email alias` , the page directs them to choose their unique Nouns email address.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DpLdRUv.jpg)\n\nAfterwards, Nouners will be free to send and receive email from this address.\n\n**Revoking Email Address Ownership**\n\nOne open question is what would happen to an account who sells or transfers his Noun after previously claiming his email address. Because owning a `@nouns.email` email address reflects one’s on-chain identity, it would be reasonable that ownership of this address is lost after losing the underlying Noun.\n\nTo implement this, Ethereum oracles on Skiff would listen for transactions where existing Noun email holders sell or transfer their last remaining Noun. Then, following an optional grace period, the email address would become disabled, becoming unusable until the account owns a Noun again.\n\n## Deliverables and Timeline (Post-PH Update)\n\n**Phase 1A: December 2022 [COMPLETED]**\nAfter Prop House Open Round 13, we successfully implemented the backend endpoints for Nouns Mail. You can view a video demo [here](https://app.skiff.com/docs/fc0a6f99-ebf3-4bfb-b724-6b70ee190103#XW5%2BD4uBTemlPZw4l3hmMaVlSn9npK4frGzDJQg8Bn0%3D) (this test account owns two other NFTs, but not a Nouns and therefore is unable to claim).\n\n**Phase 1B: January 2023**\n\nThe first phase will involve implementation of claiming Noun email addresses with the UX flow described above, including a full integration with the `@nouns.email` domain. We anticipate this taking around 2-3 weeks to fully build, test, and launch. Pending successful execution of the proposal, we are targeting a launch date of **January 20, 2022**.\n\n**Phase 3: February 2023**\n\nIn phase 2, we plan to take an active role in creating Nounish utilities based on Nouns Mail, including newsletters, domain-gated workspaces, and integrating better verification banners for the Nouns forum. We anticipate this process taking around a month, depending on the scope of utilities. We will launch these Nounish utilities as they are created, working actively with the community throughout development.\n\n## Team & Compensation\n\n[Joseph Zhang](https://twitter.com/trader___jo) - Designer, currently at Skiff and Azuki.

The DAO paid $60k for 697 traits (64 frames each/44,608 total) and the collection was completed in a total of 10 weeks. See their proposal below.\n\n([https://snapshot.org/#/meebitsdao.eth/proposal/0x7f1eac0510c868a00eae8082e258ea81a98f2dd310ec44bd9babcc752a787a0a](https://snapshot.org/#/meebitsdao.eth/proposal/0x7f1eac0510c868a00eae8082e258ea81a98f2dd310ec44bd9babcc752a787a0a))\n\nThat’s $60k dollars and months of production that each further project will be able to save.\n\nFurthermore, anyone will be able to build and animate any Noun they can imagine and export an animations of a them walking and idling in 4 different directions, as well as jumping and talking !     \n\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYFsy85wXRwsLwa8GsCTvHTXDt3A9m7CWLob6bfYPtzYo)\n\n\nMy ask is 24 ETH in funding for approximately 8 weeks of art and animated sprite sheet production (not including 8+ weeks of extended project pre-planning and prototyping with Lil Nouns Prop House 1466) and compensation for a website developer to build, integrate all Nouns assets, test and deploy the final builder website over the same period of time, not including final game integrations and fun extras.\n\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPX1ugVD6un4cvMhp8jEbJdvPCMSZprqt7YnhRJxkwQgu)\n\nOnce the art is complete, I will work in collaboration with Worldwide Webb3 team, with whom I have already worked with before, to have the entire Nouns collection immediately integrated in their metaverse - with no additional cost added to the proposal.\n\n**Why WorldWide Web3?**\n\nThey are a web3 MMORPG and have currently integrated over 160+ NFT projects (over 1 million NFTs total), with 2 years of playtime across all users and 15k trades in-game. For the recent Halloweeb event there were ~5k new players and 10k unique ones.\n\nThis Nouns game asset integration will add zero costs to this proposal because the sprite sheets are integration-ready right off the bat (just need to host on IPFS). This will also allow for proliferation of Nouns for free via in-game user engagement and official game integration promotions on social media. All included for free.\n\n ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ycdsn6c.gif)\n\n**The Builder**\n\nI like to think of this Nounish assembler website as one of many stepping stones I’d like contribute towards the future of Nounish games, for game enjoyers as well as for game creators. A creative hub where multiple Nouns collections will be accessible (Lil Nouns, Food Nouns, Sound Nouns, Gnars, etc, etc).\n\nI have many things planned for the future of this builder: the ability to add your own traits and having a sprite sheet drawing app baked into the site to make Noun game asset development seamless. Eventually, I’d like to make this site a place where artists can come to draw, host, share, and support Nounish sprite sheet collections.\n\nSky is the limit with the future functionality of animated Nouns and this proposal represents the first step on the stairway to Nounish Sprite Sheet heaven!\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n**Deliverables**\n\n- Sprite sheet art for every asset of the nouns collection (424) with new traits (159+) , for walking, idle and jumping animations. That's approximately 76,800 individual frames!\n- A website where anyone can easily generate sprite sheets for their games, or preview and download animations for a noun. \n- Easy to use features such as a Randomise button, to generate unlimited animated nouns. \n- Two view modes on the builder: sprite sheet overview and animation preview.\n- Keyboard shortcuts (arrows to move, spacebar to jump) to test animations while in preview mode\n- A video introduction to sprite sheets and how to use them in games.\n- Immediate in Worldwide Webb in collaboration with their team as soon as the assets are finalized. Worldwide Webb team have been contacted and have confirmed that Nouns integration would be a top priority.\n\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUhsjt2yKqaYMJzhy2XsGB9yiTUZc4Qr3sFodmrvstz9m)\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Why sprite sheets?** \n \n\nSprite sheets are used in games to animate the characters on the screen. They’re a collection of single frame animations, laid out like a film strip. The most common animations for sprite sheets are the idle sequence (character moving while standing still) and walking cycles (stylistic walk as the character moves around the map)\n \n\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmRchwTteCEkNYPYD7xTwPb1iv8d1qh9T5yGpYtRZtDPpX)\n\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPpQFPmP7mcrQGQt38XTNuH3rJXS7oUcaHCFL51M8jj8b)\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a pixel art sprite sheet created for Worldwide Web3 integration using a custom Dino Lil Nouns created with a Lil Nouns Sprite Sheet Builder Prototype\n\n\n**Additional Sprite Sheet Benefits:**\n\nAssets ready for use in future Nouns Community Game Jams or Hackathons\n\nAssets easily adaptable and integrated into many different game styles: endless runner (Chrome Browser Dino), 2D platformer (Mario Bros.), top-down (old School Zelda), pixel-based NFT/Metaverse integrations (Worldwide Webb/Turf/Nifty League Degens)\n\n\n___\n \n**Who is Kerimbonia?** (3D/Pixel Artist, Nouncillor)\n\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmd56XwRfzgirUobpywQDxd2hGqd6iXsMynzXz4g6wWsBj)\n\nNouncil Member, Lil Nouns Prop House 1466 ([https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-8/1466](https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-8/1466) - funded), Noun Sounds Pixel Art Contributor\n\nI’m a professional 3D artist with over 20 years of experience.

On-chain execution can be coordinated with an added layer of curation/search to simplify these otherwise complex trades. Interested in a noun for 100 lil nouns + 15ETH?  Looking to swap your punk for two nouns? Looking to pay additional WETH to trade your higher noun ID for a sub-100 ID? These trades can be posted to the atomic0 exchange with no fees, be executable by anyone, and can all be open at once until one of them is filled.\n\n**Today, there is no NFT-to-NFT exchange, only OTC trading tools. Nouns can enable this radically new style of trading, which is uniquely possible with NFTs while incentivizing Nouns proliferation.**\n\n## The proposal\n\nAcross the entire swap exchange experience, the benefits of Noun-involved trades are highlighted:\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-2.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-2.png)\n\nThe atomic0 team will use funding from this proposal to meet the deliverables and timeline (below) **and guarantee zero-fee swaps where Nouns + derivatives are involved for the lifetime of the atomic0 exchange**. Where Nouns swaps are found throughout the experience, for example, on an individual punk page with a Noun-involved swap, the swap is highlighted as being a “Nounish” zero-fee swap. Swaps comprised solely of non-Noun assets (BAYCs, Punks, etc.) will be subject to a 0.5% gross fee on the estimated value of the swap.\n\n### Implementation details and mocks\n\nIndividual punk page with an example of noun proposed bids/swaps:\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-3.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-3.png)\n\nAsset selection:\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-4.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-4.png)\n\nThe swap creation page post-asset selection:\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-5.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-5.png)\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **No fees, ever, where Noun or Noun derivatives are included in swaps for the lifetime of the exchange.**\n- An infinite number of swaps can be created (using Seaport) without the NFTs leaving your wallet until an order is filled.\n- Supports multi-sig ([Safe](https://safe.global/)) from day 1.\n- Opensea “Marked as stolen” support/warning.\n- The exchange utilizes Seaport (and the Opensea conduit, so no approvals, if approved on OS), and NFTs don’t leave your wallet until a swap is executed.\n- We **plan to bootstrap with Nouns DAO funding and provide benefits to the Nouns DAO with our no-fee swap product. We plan on a sustainable long-term roadmap via fees (0.5%) on other collections where Nouns are not involved in trades (e.g., Wrapped Punks to BAYC)**\n- Additional proposals/products are possible with fee distribution back to the treasury after we’ve cut our teeth.\n- atomic0 is not yet VC-backed and is wholly founder-owned and operated.\n\n### Our Story with Nouns/web3\n\nWe launched a proof of concept zero-fee NFT marketplace which was the first on Ethereum to have both zero fees and [optional royalties (back in June)](https://twitter.com/atomic0Trade/status/1542282578291372032). Several Nouners used it to field OTC interest in their NFTs, but notably, [ayyybee used it to sell Noun #227](https://twitter.com/a0reverserekt/status/1565441676365029379), and [**vapeape (nounder) used it to sell his V1 Cryptopunk**](https://twitter.com/a0reverserekt/status/1563972653119025152). Many other traders and collectors in the space have executed trades on the platform, including [Franklin](https://twitter.com/franklinisbored/status/1574193716809662464), who actively lists his apes on [atomic0.com](https://atomic0.com/). While I don’t yet have a Noun, I’m [still closely watching and bidding on the auctions](https://twitter.com/robertjfclarke/status/1582833840447332353). Last month, we also built the [first WETH, non-custodial bidding solution for punks](https://twitter.com/atomic0Trade/status/1606001795985453057). This proposal was made possible with Noun delegations by [cryptopunks.eth](https://twitter.com/cryptopunks_ce) and [brennen.eth](https://twitter.com/brennen_eth). A big thank you to all the Nouns who gave feedback on this prop before it went on-chain!\n\n## Deliverables and timeline\n\n- Upon proposal execution → Noun fees are removed on [atomic0.com](http://atomic0.com) for all Noun listings, including derivatives.\n- Four weeks from proposal execution → Individual Noun to Noun or Noun to Other 721 (wrapped punks, BAYC, etc.) swap creation/execution enabled.\n- Eight weeks from proposal execution → Trait and ID array on the “want” side of trades enabled.\n- Stretch goal → Automated recurring emails with the top swap offers received for your wallet.\n- Stretch goal → Automated price adjustments and bulk swap creation when Seaport 1.2 is deployed on-chain.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Why not build this as a stand-alone Nouns-specific website (e.g., nouns-swaps.com)?**\n\n- **We’ve seen project-specific marketplaces come into the fold recently, such as [Apecoinmarketplace](https://www.apecoinmarketplace.com/collections/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d) and [nounish.market](https://www.nounish.market/collections/0x9c8ff314c9bc7f6e59a9d9225fb22946427edc03). The utilization is near-zero compared with generalized marketplaces (Opensea, Looksrare, etc.). Embedding the aforementioned noun-specific benefits into the larger atomic0 swap ecosystem will incentivize and propagate nouns more than isolating noun swaps onto a Noun-only exchange. In other words, if people can also use the platform to trade their punks for apes, there’s a higher chance of Noun propagation due to incentives (no fees) for Noun-involved trades.**\n\nHow does this contrast with [Proposal 46 (Marketplace Pod Proposal)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/46)?\n\n- Our roadmap is entirely centered around enabling NFT to NFT trading, a stretch goal of proposal 46 ([noun.market](https://noun.market/)). Our deliverables focus on NFT to NFT, which makes for minimal overlap with [noun.market](http://noun.market)’s ETH to NFT focus. We see noun.market as complementary in some areas, including derivative identification for collection no-fee designation.\n\nWen open source?\n\n- We intend to open-source many components over time to allow for community contributions to the product, specifically on the front end. This will happen as we enable on-chain order creation and other helpful functionality throughout the development.\n\nHow does this contrast with existing OTC tools such as NFTTrader, Sudoswap OTC, and Swap Kiwi?\n\n- The websites mentioned above are great for situations where you’ve already found a counterparty for your swap. For example, you own a Noun, have fielded interest on Discord, and have found someone to swap your Noun for a punk. We take it up a notch with an exchange-style format allowing you to field interest across many collections and NFTs simultaneously. You could make the same noun swap offer to 100 punks of your liking, all at once, and have them all open and executable on-chain until someone fills the swap. We also support trait, collection, and ID-array bids and have many added layers of discoverability for swaps.\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-6.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-6.png)\n\nWill this require ongoing Nouns funding for maintenance?\n\n- Nouns support will sustain the platform's development through our roadmap mentioned above. Until fee-generating swaps from other collections, such as BAYC (where Nouns aren’t included), can sustain ongoing costs to operate the exchange. We may put through other proposals to add additional functionality or for long-term operational support, depending on community interest in the exchange.\n\nDo you have a plan for on-chain swap storage?\n\n- Off-chain swap storage is cheaper to implement and doesn’t require additional helper contracts, so we’re prioritizing them here for our MVP. We are open to implementing on-chain swap listings depending on the appetite, utilization, and community feedback.

These activations will include nounish giveaways, interviews with event participants and spreading the Nouns meme in a variety of different ways based on the type of event. QR Codes, POAPs and social media analytics will be used to measure reach and provide more information attached to specific events/campaigns. For more examples of this type of OTG proliferation, please reference the Prop 110 Case Studies at the end of this Proposal. \n\n**⌐◧-◧ Nounifying Popular Social Events**\nAll events in pink above are social events. In addition to NFT/Crypto native events, NounsOTG will attend and Nounify prolific social events that are in alignment with Nouns branding and the larger brand recognition that we could obtain this year. These social events include Noun by NounWest, Nounchella, Cannes Film Festival, Tribeca Film Festival, Burning Noun and SXSW Sydney. For more examples of this type of OTG proliferation, please reference the Prop 110 Social Experiments at the end of this Proposal. \n\n**⌐◧-◧ Travel Costs - Flights & Accommodation**\nThese costs cover 2-3 airline tickets (depending on the size of the event) to events, insurance and checked bag fees. For each event, the travel expenses/airline ticket price was calculated with 10% added to the total cost to account for price changes over the next several weeks during the Proposal process. Accommodation is covered at each event for Aubtoshi and production crew members. For each event, the accommodation price was calculated with 10% added to the total cost to account for price changes over the next several weeks during the Proposal process.\n\n**⌐◧-◧ Transportation/Per Diem Costs**\nDuring OTG activations, costs accrue around each activation and social event including transportations or \"Uber costs\" as well as food for working team members, water and other toiletries or event supply items that might need to be purchased. An industry standard of $100 per diem per person on the ground covers these costs. These specific costs are calculated at the price of 2 individuals receiving per diem per day on the ground.\n\n**⌐◧-◧ SWAG - Merch & Giveaways & Activations**\nSWAG is anything that the NounsOTG team will be giving away as a brand tool during these activations. This includes stickers, T-shirts and other nounish items. NounsOTG has an ongoing relationship with builders in the DAO to ensure that these items come from builders who work within the ecosystem.\n\n**⌐◧-◧ Aubtoshi, Production & Administrative Costs**\nAubtoshi's payment for NounsOTG management on Prop 110 was $3,600 per month to manage 6 major events over 6 months. With the amount of events doubling on this Proposal, Aubtoshi's NounsOTG management and expertise to do so will double to ensure full time focus on each of these OTG events. Production costs are paid on a per event basis and cover capturing content while OTG, editing and distributing the content over the various OTG social media channels. Administrative costs cover the management of calendars, shipment tracking, live production schedule management, vendor coordination, and overall schedule and time management of NounsOTG events and activations.\n\n**⌐◧-◧ NounsOTG x Activations** All events in yellow above are the main activations. These 4 main OTG activations in 2023 are NFT Paris, ETH Denver, NFT Toronto and Burning Noun. NounsOTG has laid out the budget for each of these events below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9rQ4QVu.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BU64XhJ.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FydwNMI.png)\n\n**⌐◧-◧ NFT Paris** is holding its second annual NFT event. After selling out a smaller venue last year, the team has more than doubled down with the iconic Grand Palais, which sits right across from the Eiffel Tower. John Hammon's successful nounish activation throughout Paris, France helped bring new crypto users to the forefront, all with their eye on attending this event. Aubtoshi is already approved as a speaker. Our budget would account for a shared Platinum Sponsorship with Poap.fr (same level as Ledger), items needed for a booth activation, a speaker slot and a budget to throw a smaller/more intimate activation to celebrate the end of this event. We will begin immediately implementing a production schedule of this event if this Proposal is successfully passed. ([event website](https://www.nftparis.xyz/))\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IM6GcVO.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CVVtO2L.png)\n\n**⌐◧-◧ ETH Denver** takes over the entire downtown Denver, Colorado area for a week to celebrate and educate event goers on NFTs, crypto and the web3 space in general. This event is known for having a jam packed daytime schedule with few social event options in the evening. NounsOTG has the opportunity to sponsor and produce an artist focused social event for 1-2 days during the event. The private location (think giant warehouse with open walls for artists) is on hold with nounish friends and we will begin immediately implementing a production schedule of this event if this Proposal is successfully passed. ([event website](https://www.ethdenver.com))\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M20WGMA.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/E9eLgNq.png)\n\n**⌐◧-◧ NFT Toronto** is another first annual event celebrating the increase in NFT and crypto native users in the Toronto, Canada area. One of the founders is involved with the Solana Nouns team and is determined for this event to be nounish. Budgets account for sponsorship opportunities and the chance to create a social, interactive nounish experience. *(website launching soon)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tZGrDlw.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NuKAAhk.png)\n\n**⌐◧-◧ Burning Noun (Burning Man)** is an event known by people from around the world as one of the most dynamic and unique art festivals in existence. For one week, an entire city is formed with the center point being a wooden structure called \"The Man\". All attendees are encouraged to participate by creating art cars and wooden structures of their own that can be ceremoniously burned at the end of the event. We want to have a focus on Burning Man as a proof of concept for larger event participation in purely socially events. We will construct and burn a wooden effigy of Noun 0, releasing energies and paying homage to the origin Noun, while lighting the way towards the future of all Nouns. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CXxl9zG.png)\n\n**⌐◧-◧ NounsOTG Multi-sig (3/5 Signature)**\nThe NounsOTG Multi-sig will be a 3/5 signature multi-sig that will disperse funds on a monthly basis based on the timing of each event/prop. All event budgets must be transferred a minimum of two months prior to the event itself. All events that take place in under two months will be transferred immediately upon a successfully passed Proposal.

If a change is not possible, funds pertaining to that specific event will be sent back to the DAO. All changes that require these decisions will be made public.\n\n**⌐◧-◧ Proposal Transparency & Proposer Accountability**\nNounsOTG wants to be an example of going above and beyond. We believe that reporting has multiple benefits including data generation to assess further involvement with IRL events/activations in the future. It also helps future proposers understand the hard costs associated with IRL events. This prop and supporting documentation can be used as a measurement tool to evaluate future activations of this type. We hope to continue to serve the community and represent Nouns DAO IRL.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vscI7ar.png)\n\nWhy is NounsOTG the right fit for continued IRL representation of Nouns?

We have had so many valuable lessons from these experiences that will allow NounsOTG to make this next six months a valuable investment on the DAO's end when it comes to IRL integration of the meme.\n\nThese proposals have allowed NounsOTG to interact with 11 different on-chain proposals within the nounish ecosystem. This has evolved our understanding of how to interact with and educate the public on the Nouns meme and the ecosystem as a whole, while meeting other builders and learning their stories.\n\nWe have included case studies and data sets for the DAO and future proposers.

The Rose Parade x Rose Bowl is a 10 day OTG activation with key 3 events happening that require venues, coordination of over 15 brand ambassadors, proliferation of thousands of nounish items and travel/accommodation costs for 4 OTG members.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/N67B3GG.png)\n\nIt is important to note that although content creation and dissemination was not outlined in Prop 110 as a deliverable, it became clear to NounsOTG during our first 6 month trial that content capturing and creation are vital when proliferating IRL to create value from the event even after it has been completed. All content you see on these case studies is being scheduled to be distributed on the [NounsOTG YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS_phF_niMXOADdx694y68w), [NounsOTG TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@nounsotg) and [NounsOTG Twitter](https://twitter.com/NounsOTG) accounts over the next several weeks to maintain a stream of content while we capture this next phase of material.

Our first Nouns DAO offering will be to create and craft a premium, 3-year old Nouns Whisky. Our model is sustainable and returns a percentage of profits back to the DAO.\n\nThere are distilleries around the world that have whisky (distilled twice) or whiskey (distilled 3 times) in their warehouses ready to be sold in a barrel or a bottle format to anyone that can then slap a label onto the bottle, create a concept around it and call it your own. This is awesome and is easily accessible for any builder to start something overnight, but why do that if you have the infrastructure, patience and expertise to create something that is authentic and entirely new. This product is then born with the help of the community and collectively we can watch our creation mature, flourish and proliferate over a span of 3 years, and then watch as it leaves the distillery for the real world to take on a life of its own as it finds its way to your home, bar or restaurant.\n\nThis project will first take shape with an oak barrel, and Whisky barrel or cask trading is becoming more popular across the world and is considered a better investment in the long-run as whisky is an appreciating asset and therefor probably more valuable down the line than most of the nft projects that you have floating around in your wallet and hidden folder. With Nouns Whisky we’re making it easy, with less barriers to entry, so that anyone with 0.35 Eth in their wallet can buy 1 of 500 barrels of whisky (25L / 6.6 Gallons) on OpenSea. Your whisky barrel will be stored securely in the warehouse and is now tied to your wallet address. This is the beauty of provenance and PBT (physically backed tokens) that record your purchase and ownership on the blockchain.\n\nOk, you now own a barrel of whisky in a beautiful city in Cape Town, South Africa. You probably haven’t visited our country, you can’t see your barrel of whisky in person, but you’re excited to own something that is actually tangible, real and valuable. So now you must hodl your nft as the whisky ageing process takes 3 years until it is ready to be bottled and shipped. This is why we’ll be installing a live camera feed in the warehouse and doing quick vlogs during the setup phase so that Nouners can watch us start this journey together. And remember you have a cool as f**k, 1 of 1 Nouns Barrel Head artwork that represents 1 of 500 Nouns Whisky barrels in the warehouse, this is ground breaking for the ecosystem! With everyones help this could possibly be the best long-term investment that you’ll make in Web3 in 2023 and only for roughly $450. But the real question is, can your paper hands become diamond hands and hold onto this token until the next bull run?\n\nAnd now to introduce ourselves. Hi guys, my name is Pierre and I’m the Project Manager for Nouns Whisky, South Africa and this is Andre the Master Distiller, he has won various awards and has been distilling Whisky for 7 years. We’re both makers, builders, love Nouns, everything Web3 and we’re asking for an investment of 102 Eth to create the first of many Nouns Whisky projects over the next 7 years until we reach 2030 when we can release a 7-year old premium whisky born from the Web3 treasury of the Nouns DAO. We will keep 5 barrels aside for this, as it is the perfect goal for us to collectively pursue with ‘One Noun, Every Day, Forever’ on the blockchain. We believe in the ethos of for Nouns by Nouners and then inviting newcomers to join us. This project is our contribution to the Nouns virtuous cycle and a global cultural revolution. We invite you to take a look at our sustainable proposal & vision, and please feel free to ask us any questions in the Nouns Whisky Discord or Discourse with links below, let’s make this happen and do something cool in the consumables category! \n\n*Jim Beam x Mila is the perfect campaign to sum up our Nouns Whisky project in 30 sec and honestly, we didn't even know this advert existed until a few weeks back, as the collaboration was launched in 2015.

Let’s break it down simply:**\n\n- 10 Eth for production management costs, merchandising, design & local content creation.\n- 20 Eth for global marketing, strategic partnerships & paid advertising over 24 months (This amount will be held in a wallet, in Eth and deployed as needed).\n- 20 Eth for 100 oak barrels, spirits & labor. These are owned by Nouns DAO.\n- 52 Eth for the facility infrastructure that will produce & house the barrels for 3 years (This amount will be converted to USD/ZAR and kept in a South African bank account that can be viewed upon request by the DAO as it will be used to pay monthly expenses over a period of 36 months).\n\nTotal ask: 102 Eth (in-depth breakdown below Q&A)\n\nIf you have any questions that aren’t posted here please reach out and post them for us to answer: [Comment on Discourse.](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-whisky-12-jan-onchain-prop-sponsored-by-nouncil/3553) \n\n\n---\n\n**Questions & Answers**\n\n1. **When will the project launch:** If approved, on the 15th of February 2023 we’ll have the soft launch on OpenSea.

We will continue to keep on making more Nouns Whisky Barrels year by year and start a Nouns Gin & Vodka brand down the line.\n21. **What is the proliferation process?** By creating hype around the whisky project on a global scale with paid advertising and strategic partnerships. We will also introduce South Africa to the Nouns ecosystem by starting with the Whisky project and then branching off into other R&D opportunities. \n22. **Are we a Nouns Whisky DAO?** Not at the moment, this could be something that we introduce down the line once we have the basic Nouns Whisky infrastructure in place.\n23. **Are we a Nouns Whisky Bar?** A small one yes, we will host a pop-up bar every 3rd month at the distillery with a live feed so Nouners can tune in.\n24. **What is our Nouns Whisky Club?** This will be a project that we will introduce in Q3 of 2023.\n25. **Do we own the Nouns Whisky or Whiskey names?** No, we encourage other distilleries to create their own versions and join the global community.\n26. **Will we be making Whisky for other DAO's?** No, we're doing this exclusively for Nouns.\n27. **Is this Probably Something in 2023?** Most definitely! \n\nWith all the love & effort going into this project, it is a community endeavour and we plan to work with Nouns builders & content creators, the general community and anyone that wants to join us on this exciting journey to create this high-end luxury Nouns product that you can hand down to further generations if you have diamonds hands!\n\n*And remember: ‘Whisky’ derives from the Gaelic term usquebaugh which translates as ‘water of life’ and Nouns are the seeds of Web3 that we can help grow and prosper through this project for years to come.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FYLg5Zu.png)\n\n---\n\n**NOUNS WHISKY ⌐◨-◨ : The In-Depth Business Details.**\n\n---\n\n**1. The inception and execution is broken down into 6 x Phases.**\n\n***Phase 1 - Nouns Nfts - January & February 2023***\n\n* 500 Barrel Heads are designed & generated and uploaded to OpenSea manually. No minting site. View the first batch here: [Nouns Whisky Barrel Nfts](https://opensea.io/collection/nouns-whisky-barrels)\n* Nft sales / claiming starts on the 15th of February 2023 with a soft launch.\n* The DAO holds 100 barrels and can decide how these are allocated.\n* The distillery holds 400 barrels and these will all be sold to the public at 0.35 eth each.\n* The project does not need to sell all of the Nfts at the soft launch as this is an ongoing project.\n\n***Phase 2 - February & March of 2023***\n\n* The Pienaar & Son Distillery will source and acquire the 25L Oak Barrels.\n* A 3-year lease on a storage facility will be negotiated and locked down for 36 months.\n* Sin tax licensing will be registered for the project.\n* Insurance for the barrels will be setup.\n* A security company will be contracted to make regular rounds at the facility during the projects lifespan.\n* Employment of labor will be needed to set the barrels up in the storage facility.\n* Public Liability insurance will be set up for the labourers & potential visitors.\n* A pallet jack will be bought to move the barrels, bottles & liquid around in the facility.\n* Liquid for the whisky barrels will be produced.\n* Holding tanks (2x200L + 2x500L) will be acquired for the facility.\n* Internet & a permanent computer is set up in the storage facility.\n* A camera is installed in the storage facility so that anyone can view the process of the barrels being set up via the Pienaar & Son website.\n* The distilling of the whisky barrels starts in mid April.\n\n***Phase 3 - March & April of 2023***\n\n* Provenance / ownership of the barrels will be recorded with the Nfts ID and these Nfts can be re-sold from the launch date over the span of 36 months until the whisky is ready to be bottled in 2026.\n* A press release will be compiled explaining the collaboration between the Nouns Dao project & the Pienaar & Son Distillery.\n* This will be sent out in late March to various news outlets across South Africa and to select Nft, whisky, food & beverage news websites.\n* A more in-depth Nouns Whisky website will be created.\n\n***Phase 4 - May 2023***\n\n* 4 x Small events will be held at the distillery with Nouns memorabilia on display.\n\n***Phase 5 - June 2023 onwards***\n\n* The barrels will be monitored by the distillery over the coming months and updates will be added to the Nouns Whisky website for all holders to see.\n\n***Phase 6 - March / April / May / June 2026***\n\n* The whisky will be ready to be bottled & packaged for the Nouns DAO & the public holders.\n* 40 x (500 ml) bottles will be available from each barrel, also accounting for liquid evaporation over 36 months.\n* The owner of the barrel will then be able to ship these bottles to a specified destination across the world. P&P / Shipping will be for the holders cost. Or the holder can enter a storage agreement with the Distillery and the whisky can age further. \n* If the holder chooses to redeem their barrel and put their 40 bottles up for individual sales on our OpenSea page, this is an option.\n\n---\n\n**2. Nouns Whisky South Africa Project Costs:**\n\nFor this project to proceed, upfront costs are necessary to create the Nouns Whisky infrastructure and to produce the liquid. We are asking for 102 Eth with the aim for the DAO to recoup this investment through their 100 Nft sales if they choose to do so. Pienaar & Son have a proven track record in running a profitable alcohol business for over 7 years.\n\nWhy have we chosen Nouns Whisky as the product that will kick-start Nouns proliferation in South Africa? Sustainability is the answer. Alcohol products have played a fundamental role in supporting and helping to pioneer the art & music scenes across South Africa over the last 20 years, and now with this business plan Nouns can join the playground.\n\n**20 ETH ~ WHISKY PRODUCTION**\n\nThe bulk purchases here will be made in the first 2 months of the project.\n\n* Purchase Oak barrels (100 guaranteed to be produced for the DAO)\n* Produce new-make spirit to fill the oak barrels. The oak + ageing time is what gives whisky its characteristic flavour.\n* Depending on public sales, the additional barrels will be purchased and liquid distilled.\n\n**52 ETH ~ FACILITY & LEGAL**\n\nThese expenses will be kept in an account that can be viewed upon request by the DAO as it will be used to pay monthly expenses over the 36 months. Transparency with this spend is important to us. \n\n* 3 Year storage facility lease\n* 2 Month rental deposit fee\n* Storage facility insurance for 3 years\n* Liquor licensing & legal fees for 3 years\n* 4 x Holding tanks\n* 1 x Pallet jack\n* Wooden shelving for the barrels\n* Security fees for 3 years\n* Labor \n* Public Liability insurance for 3 years\n* 1 x Computer and hi-res camera setup\n* High-speed internet rental for 3 years for live facility feed\n\n**10 ETH ~ PROJECT PRODUCTION**\n\nThese expenses are part retro-funding and will be split between Pierre, Andre and the specific suppliers need in the first 2 months. We have been extremely frugal with these line items to reduce the overall production costs. Please note that the R&D process to introduce Nouns to South Africa started in June 2022.\n\n* 2 Month Nft design & brand development fees\n* 6 Months design & South African marketing material fees\n* 6 Months social media fees\n* 6 Months project management fees\n* 1 Months PR agency fees for the Press Release\n* 4 x Eventing fees in June 2023\n* Basic website development\n* 150 x Nouns t-shirts & tote bags (given away for free at the distillery)\n* Photographer for content creation\n* Accounting fees for tax declaration\n\n**20 ETH ~ GLOBAL MARKETING, PAID ADVERTISING & STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS**\n\nPlease note, this amount can be deployed by the DAO in a multi-sig over time, it is not needed upfront. We arrived at this amount after feedback from our discussion in our Nouncil meeting.\n\n- Identify key food & beverage websites and contact them for product reviews and paid advertising over 12 months. \n- Connect with Nft News outlets for reviews and paid advertising.\n- Connect with traditional media outlets for advertorials & press release information.\n- Connect with established builders in the Nouns ecosystem to create paid content for Nouns Whisky.\n- Look at ways to utilise digital billboards with Nouns Whisky assets.\n- Get Nounish studio involved to create some video content.\n\n---\n\n**3. How much ROI can the Nouns DAO expect from the Nouns Whisky project?**\n\n- 102 Eth investment\n- Produces 100 barrels for the DAO\n- 40 bottles per barrel = 4000 bottles\n- If the DAO chooses to hold onto all the barrels till 2026. There will be a $100 reserve price per bottle on OpenSea = $4000 per barrel\n- If the DAO sells all 4000 bottles in 2026/2027 at $100 each that = $400 000 = 300 Eth at todays price of $1 333,25 from an 102 Eth investment. This is a best case scenario but conservative at $100 auction price per bottle. \n- If the DAO sells all 100 barrels at 1 Eth each, forecasting they reach this price during the 36th month period, the DAO will make 100 Eth to recoup the 102 Eth spend.\n- Besides the 100 barrels that the Nouns DAO owns, it will receive an additional 10% of the net income of the distilleries Nouns Whisky sales from the 400 barrels on OpenSea. This amount will be sent to Maty to record and confirm that the payment has been made once we reach a sold out position.\n- The DAO will also receive a 2.5% royalty from all of the sales on OpenSea in perpetuity (barrels & bottles).\n\n---\n\n**4. Pienaar & Sons Distillery Sales Case Study in South Africa.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sHxeklZ.png)\n\nDistillery Promo Video: [Click To Watch On YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9mh-DQYbI)\n\n\nDistillery Location at V&A Waterfront, Cape Town: [View On Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/makerslanding)\n\nDistillery Images + 11.4k Followers: [View On Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pienaarandson/)\n\nHere is the distilleries current business model and you can see their whisky here: [Tiny Batch Whisky - Heavy Char – Pienaar & Son](https://pienaarandson.co.za/products/tiny-batch-whisky-heavy-char)\n\nPlease note that these figures are based on the distillery already having invested in the infrastructure to create these batches 5 years ago and with 225 litre barrels.\n\n**Cost to produce and store first 2 x (185L after evaporation) Barrels = ± 2.5 Eth (ageing period - 4 years)**\n\nTotal bottles produced = 1100\nBottle retail price in South Africa = 0,032 Eth each\nGross income from bottle sales in South Africa = 35,42 Eth\n**Time taken to sell out = 19 days**\n\n**Nett profit from bottle sales = 23,20 Eth**\n(Ex Advertising) ROI = 994%\n\n*Awards: World Whisky Awards - Single grain, Single cask - Bronze Medal*\n\n\n---\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/COJxx2z.png)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**5. So what does this mean in the long-run for Nouns Whisky?**\n\n1) When the Whisky ageing process comes full circle in 2026 we can start selling the whisky across South Africa.\n2) We can offer the Whisky to bars across South Africa.\n3) We can offer the Whisky to music festivals across South Africa.\n4) We can offer the Whisky to major liquor outlets across South Africa.\n5) We can create pop-up bars and sell the Whisky directly to consumers.\n6) With our e-commerce store we can sell bottles directly to customers.\n7) We can offer the product to an international audience. \n\n---\n\n**6. What does this do to create sustainability and proliferation?**\n\n1) Alcohol companies make great margins on their products that creates regular cash flow as alcohol is available to consume 12 months of the year. You can sell the product 365 days a year as it is not a seasonal business plan.\n2) Nouns Whisky can invest financially in music events, artists, musicians and any other strategic partnerships with profit made from sales in South Africa. This is key if you're going to build a brand with the goal of it being sustainable to 2030 and beyond.\n3) With profits the business can also create social responsibility campaigns and donate to charities to do community cleanups and more. \n\n---\n\n**7. Why should Nouns invest in financially sustainable projects.**\n\nThis is an opportunity for Nouns to branch further into the African continent with a sustainable business plan. We can give a % of profits back to the DAO in perpetuity, R&D other product lines and turn the investment into a long lasting brand building endeavour. It is that simple and makes this investment a winning formula.\n\n---\n\n**8. What happens with the project in 2024, 2025, 2026 and onwards so that we can release more products?**\n\nWith the profits that we generate from the sale of the 400 Nouns Whisky barrel nfts we will release another batch of whisky each year that will mature for another 3 years, this will be available to the public again to trade and this will allow the project to remain sustainable without requesting the DAO to fund us each year. We can continue to create more content, on-board new buyers and continue the proliferation of Nouns Whisky and best of all we can continue to produce a 2.5% secondary sales royalty in perpetuity for the Nouns DAO from OpenSea nfts, and 10% of the primary nft barrel sales every year. We will also be looking at R&D opportunities in the coffee & bottled water categories as an additional way to introduce Nouns to South Africa and create a ROI for Nouns DAO.\n\n---\n\n**9. And now it's time to showcase our brand assets, look & feel!** \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ixgdnRo.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/loLicUv.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qhHIIul.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YAdUIGY.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nSYtk2E.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JchFWDl.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9ekV2za.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8UCZZze.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jPxysyI.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/39q4eV3.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JUeqc9d.png)\n\n---\n        \n**10. Our experience in the music industry with alcohol brands.**\n    \nTo strengthen our pitch and to showcase our experience in the alcohol and music industry: here is a music video that we helped produce in South Africa and it has accumulated 7.7 million views. There are key elements that played a role in the creation of this video and first and fore-mostly the Afrikaans band needs to write a song that the nation wants to play on repeat, they hit this for a home run. Alcohol companies sponsor culture and this could easily be a video that Nouns Whisky could have produced as Jagermeister paid for it. We have a lot of opportunities down the line to work with musicians in South Africa.\n\nWe helped the same band release a Vinyl and EP album backed by a physical and collectible box of beers and there was a free album inside. This could have also been a project backed by a Nft. The box of beers was then distributed across South Africa to more than 100 stores where fans could buy the box of beers. There was a limited amount and fans were seen standing outside of the liquor outlets waiting for the stores to open. This is something that Nouns Whisky could have sponsored. I’m using these projects to showcase the power of what an alcohol business & project can do with profits / marketing budget. This is the same model that Jagermeister uses, they sell bottles and use a portion of this income to connect with culture and introduce their brand in countries across the world.\n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/herO5Pz.jpg)\n\nBand Music Video at Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens: [Click To Watch On YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TDqNyL2KPQ)\n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/dS0FyEt.png)\n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/n7I2Txd.jpg)\n\n---\n\n**11.

And to conclude, our Roles & Experience: Andre & Pierre**\n\n***Andre Pienaar:***\n\n* Proposal\n* Master Distiller\n* Facility Management\n* Project Management\n* On-Site Content Creation\n* Merchandise Production\n* Nouns Events\n\n***Pierre Coetzee**:*\n\n* Proposal\n* Project Management\n* On-Site Content Creation\n* Merchandise Production\n* Design Management\n* Nft Management\n* Blockchain Payments Management\n* Nouns Events\n\n***Andre Pienaar:*** [https://pienaarandson.co.za/](https://pienaarandson.co.za/)\n\n*I can confidently say that whisky was always part of the plan, and one of the cornerstone reasons I wanted to start the Pienaar & Son distillery. With the foundation of my fathers’ knowledge of building beautifully sophisticated distillation equipment, and my biochemistry and chemistry degree, I knew we would have a significant advantage in the understanding and manipulation of the fermentation and distillation processes required to produce a world class whisky. There is a lot more at play than making some moonshine and chucking it in a barrel.*\n\n***Pierre Coetzee:*** [https://futurenow.world/](https://futurenow.world/)\n\n*Over a span of 15 years spent in Cape Town & South Africa, active in the skateboarding, music & art scenes: I’ve been fortunate to pioneer and explore these movements through small investments into supporting skateboarders, musicians & artists careers. I’ve been able to work with the majority of the alcohol & lifestyle brands with sponsorship procurement and speciality brand activations & development. Over the past 20 months I’ve navigated the crypto art industry as a creator & collector, following Punk 4156, his journey, the sale of his Crypto Punk and the inception of the Nouns DAO initiative / collective. We’re in a new era of a cultural revolution supported by cryptocurrencies & DAO’s, this is why I’m approaching Nouns DAO to work with Andre and his local Cape Town business as an anchoring point whereby we can start the proliferation of Nouns in South Africa. This is our first sustainable proposal to the DAO and once proven successful, there will be more opportunities to further introduce Nouns to the melting pot of South African and global cultures that reside here. We live in a beautiful country and need to innovate by using the blockchain as a vehicle to help small businesses to thrive and prosper. Nouns Whisky will be the foundation of our collective journey.*\n\n***Brands I’ve collaborated with:** Honda Music Stage, Vans, Converse, Puma, Levi’s, Ray-Ban, Red-Bull, Jagermeister, Jose Cuervo, Olmeca, Smirnoff, Jameson Whisky, Three Ships Whisky.*\n\n***Artists I’ve worked with between 2010 to 2015 in Cape Town as a venue & events manager:** Qbert, Diplo, Steve Aoki, Foals, Public Enemy, DJ Premier, DJ Krush & Seth Troxler. I also helped create and produce a 3 day festival sponsored by VANS titled Endless Daze and helped to launched  a beer brand for one of South Africa's biggest bands.*\n\n***Nouns derivative project:** When we started our journey in June to pitch a prop to Nouns Dao we wanted to first engage with the community and release our own generative collection that would also incorporate some of our creative work, some fun words, other CC0 and iconic web3 projects. We did this by showcasing the designs on the Nouns bodies. This was a challenging project and led us down a rabbit hole as it was the first time that we would do a 10k mint and use a design generator. We had never looked into contracts, how to DIY it and finally stumbled upon NiftyKit and deployed the project as a free mint on Polygon so that the community could collect 20 per wallet and share them with friends.*\n\n***Web3 Projects I've complete:** In 2021 I was the first artist to be featured on the OpenSea homepage as they wanted to pivot into featuring more art and less pfps. This fine art piece of mine was showcased and received 15k views and is still featured on their Twitter banner. As a part of the showcase I also gave away over 150 unique nfts for free to onboard new collectors, free nfts were few and far between at this point in time. So this was a really cool experience and I had the opportunity to meet a lot of new people in the nft community. We then did an unofficial Cool Cats digital beer and if you as a holder bought a 6-pack we would then send you 6 beer nfts with your pfp on it, and people would share it with each other via polygon. We customised just over 100 bottles that got shared around Twitter. Lastly we were able to secure some plots and built 3 x galleries in Decentraland. A very time consuming exercise but a lot of fun!*\n\n\n---\n\nThanks for your time, Andre and I appreciate it and fingers crossed we can collectively get this project approved, it will be an exciting journey for the global Nouns Community starting a new chapter in 2023!\n\n---\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/314OzeI.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pPwCydM.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/86guZrK.jpg)\n\n---\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bdF2cgw.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MFmPXN8.png)\n\n---\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PtfEKdD.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dG1X8WD.png)\n\n---\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dufRf3R.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4uiZlRa.png)"},{"blockNumber":16413247,"blockHash":"0xaf656faa450abe840b9de6355d09f4c86df521e578f82d622cc7bd5a4b0190dd","transactionIndex":243,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xf2197c9626035cb5650d2fc5002bfafe7e4f8b4348dc064c4d9c9085cb16a388","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":209,"proposer":"0x5606B493c51316A9e65c9b2A00BbF7Ff92515A3E","targets":["0xCb2D68C9e7194B9cE0837eE5E676e796CB31C55a"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":16449247,"endBlock":16485247,"description":"# Mucho Love v1.25 [revised]\n\n# Mucho Love v1.25 [revised]\n\n### tl;dr\n\n- Mucho Love is a social impact platform based in the Dominican Republic. It uses a \"see good, do good\" format to increase brand equity (⌐◧-◧) and raise awareness through its activations. \n- Mucho Love has also formed an in-real-life community of over 60 active members learning about web3, crypto, and Nouns while participating in helping causes they love. \n-  During the last 6 months, we’ve seen how our work has been spreading a meme and increasing awareness about Nouns in all the people that interact with our content.\n- Mucho Love is requesting 70.86 ETH for a 4 month extension to organize four activations in the Dominican Republic that will have Nouns in their core, organize an event to thank volunteers for their work, and compensate the core team for their work. \n\n\n\n### What is Mucho Love?\n\nMucho Love is a nouns-based social impact platform that was created 6 months ago. Mucho Love started with a Lil Nouns prop.house (https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-3), then went on-chain on prop 137 for further proof-of-work (https://nouns.wtf/vote/137), and now is back on-chain to keep growing, improving, and experimenting further. \n\nMucho Love is currently working to become a major platform that promotes goodness in the Dominican Republic. A platform powered by ⌐◧-◧. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2pdNlcP.png)\n\n\n### What has Mucho Love done? \n\n\n<div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/778244189?h=169183d222&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479/embed\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n**Other videos:**\n- https://twitter.com/mucholovedr/status/1606635791593119744\n- https://twitter.com/mucholovedr/status/1565689757740535808\n- https://twitter.com/mucholovedr/status/1595141776867983361\n\n\n### Total impact generated\n\nMucho Love works with a \"see good, do good\" format. A format that uses social impact to incentivize others to do the same. This format allows us to raise awareness of the impacts we're activating and increases brand equity for ⌐◧-◧ .\n\nMucho Love is focused on creating a positive connotation in a society that knows nothing about Nouns. Mucho Love will allow us to establish the ⌐◧-◧ as a goodness symbol within our community.\n\nIn the past six months, **Mucho Love has shared joy, smiles, gifts and a whole lot of love to impact the following**: \n* 750+ Children \n* 300+ Families\n* 100+ Dogs\n* 60+ Volunteers\n* 3 Institutions\n* 1 community\n\n\nAside from social impact and the people impacted, it is crucial to generate attention/awareness on social media to keep growing the platform.\n\nSo far, Mucho Love has:\n* 0 followers to 1700+ on [Instagram](https://https://www.instagram.com/mucholovedr/) (most followed ⌐◧-◧-related account)\n* Generated over 16,000 views from videos ([Twitter](https://https://twitter.com/mucholovedr))\n* Generated close to 70,000 likes throughout all posts (Instagram)\n* Generated over 20,000 views from reels (Instagram)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gOc2sEw.png)\n****Data from the respective social media platforms mentioned***\n\nContent creation is an essential aspect of the brand building because it helps to establish the brand's identity, communicate its values and message, and engage with its audience. \n\nMucho Love aims to create a positive association with the noggles, show people what's possible to develop with Nouns, and engage with the new audience interacting with ML & Nouns.\n\nSee good, do good content will help us reach a broad audience and funnel people into Nouns, therefore showing them how they can form part of Nouns and start forming part of the community.\n\nWe will use Instagram, TikTok, and Youtube-Shorts to post the generated content.\n\n* **Youtube**: Short video format striving to combine storytelling with good animations, edits, and clips that focus on wholesome emotions.\n* **Tiktok**: Short video formats with catchy hooks with the main point of spreading the ⌐◧-◧s through the platform. Making it easier for people who find the ⌐◧-◧s interesting to click the profile and access other social media where more information will be more easily found (Instagram, Twitter).\n* **Instagram**: So far, Instagram has worked for us pretty well. A few flops and one fantastic post (a post with almost 67,000 likes), but it's been great in general. Instagram plans to be the \"face\" of what ML stands for, does, and activates. We'll also be using challenge formats to engage more people.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iY7cUIp.png)\n****post link: https://www.instagram.com/p/Ck1eho1vr5Z/***\n\n### A nounish community \n\nDuring the past 6 months, we've formed an in-real-life nounish community of over 60 people. Mucho Love is a community that actively represents what nounish is, understanding it deeply.\n\nIt's been interesting to see how people who knew nothing about web3, crypto, or nouns are now having their curiosity sparked by our activations and the one thing I've constantly been telling them: Nouns funds ideas ⌐◧-◧\n\nDuring the next four months, you'll see Mucho Love community members creating proposals and activating their ideas. Volunteers have been learning about Nouns, Lil Nouns, prop.house, and have already thrown some ideas they'd like to propose. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Q5EInDR.jpg)\n\n\n\n### The next 4 months\n\nDuring the next four months, Mucho Love will perform four activations within the Dominican Republic.\n\n- **Staffeld x Mucho Love: A Nounish Masterpiece**\n    We'll be going to an orphanage with @staffeld (https://twitter.com/staffeld) to make a fun art competition, \"1 Professional Artist vs. 100 Children\". This event focuses on having children paint their own \"nounish masterpiece\" on a massive canvas with the help of ML volunteers and using the ⌐◨-◨ as the central theme of the activity. **We will also donate Nounish Coloring Books made by Ilustradora and Messhup.**\n- **Nounish Homerun ⌐◨-◨ Baseball/Softball Sponsor**\n    We will be donating baseball/softball uniforms (with the ⌐◨-◨ embroided as the \"sponsor\"), bats, baseballs, softballs, helmets, and gloves. This activation will consist of a game of baseball/softball, Mucho Love Volunteers vs their team. The main impact of this activity is giving children and teenagers the proper equipment to play the sport they love. The equipment donated should last between 3-5 years.\n- **Giving free haircuts for an entire day to an underserved community**\n    We'll be hiring barbers to cut hair for free in one of the most underserved communities in the DR. This event looks to explore how simple things can be so meaningful for humans and to try and have deep conversations with the people from the community.\n- **Knife x Mucho Love: A Nounish Cooking Challenge**\n    We'll be collaborating with a cooking institute in the DR to cook children from orphanages/underserved communities their dream meals. We will donate care packages with food essentials for the families/institution of every child present. We'll be \"nounifying\" the food prepared at this activation.\n\nIn the case that one of the activations can't happen due to any unexpected events, this is the backup activity:\n\n- **Nursing-home: A Nounish Day**\nWe'll be going to an underfunded nursing home to spend a day sharing, eating, and playing with the people who live there. This event aims to connect with an older population and get insights into their experiences, life, and how to live a good, nounish life.\n\nThese activations combine the communities/institutions/people that the Mucho Love community wants to help and the narratives that will generate a lot of attention on social media.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3cqgI1o.jpg)\n\n\n\n### What value does this bring to NounsDAO? \n\nMucho Love is activating IRL experiences with Nouns at its core. During the last months, we've seen how our work has been spreading a meme and increasing awareness in all people interacting with our content.\n\nMucho Love is also increasing brand equity through social media and the content it produces while creating a positive association and connotation with the ⌐◧-◧. Providing in-real-life activations where people can interact with Nouns physically has immense power.\n\nAside from the evidence (views, awareness, engagement, meme expansion), we can connect humans with experiences and a community representing Nouns. The ML community will only keep growing and growing as the platform itself grows; there's no limit to how big this can get and how much we can get done.\n\nYou can generally explain things by using examples, defining terms, providing visual context, breaking down concepts into smaller parts, and using analogies. Through Mucho Love, people learn through action what nounish is and means. Mucho Love can leverage all of the mentioned ways with its format. We can noun-pill in one of the most organic ways possible by forming part of something meaningful.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/41U2NGC.jpg)\n\n### What does the future of Mucho Love look like?\nML is working to be a platform that expands Nouns to new people, places, and things. Using see-good, do-good content and a growing, engaged community, ML can grow into one of the most influential platforms powered by Nouns. ML is currently testing many ideas, content formats, video styles, and activations. \n\nML is currently testing many ideas, different content formats, different video styles, different types of activations. As we keep experimenting and implementing new ideas I am certain that we will find our correct flow and \"platform fit\". \n\nI (necfas) see ML as a platform that creates opportunities to impact people's lives. ML takes the impact generated to develop content and represent what Nouns is and what it's capable of generating.\n\nWe expect Mucho Love to evolve in the following ways:\n- Longer format videos (Youtube)\n- Grow the volunteering community to over 250 active members by the end of 2023\n- Develop new ways to onboard community members to participate within Nouns\n- Create recurrent activations leveraging the talents of our volunteers (for example, Nounish Medical Operatives every four months)\n- Involve more institutions and businesses to collaborate on the activations.\n\n\n### What's the ask? \n\nA total of 70.86 ETH to fund the following 4 months of activations, part-time marketing/content creation team, and compensation for core team members. \n\n\n- Social Impact Fund - 40.35 ETH\n    - Activations Fund - 36.35 ETH\n    - Volunteer Gratitude Event - 4 ETH (event to thank volunteers for their amazing work)\n- Part-Time Marketing/Content Creation Team- 13.01 ETH\n    - Content Creator (4.18 ETH / 1,462.5 USD per month)\n    - Video Editor ( 6.97 ETH / 2437.5 USD per month)\n    - Community Manager (1.86 ETH / 650 USD per month) \n- Compensation for 4 core team members - 17.5 ETH, in charge of: \n    - Content Vision/Ideation/Business Relationships ([necfas](https://twitter.com/necfas)) - 10 ETH (2.5 per month)\n    - Logistics/Payments ([mimix](https://twitter.com/miagiulianag)) 4 ETH (1 per month)\n    - Outreach (Cristina R.) - 1.75 ETH (0.4375 per month)\n    - Quotations (Marian J.) - 1.75 ETH (0.4375 per month)\n\n**considering 1 ETH = 1400 USD for USD costs*\n**if there's a surplus of USD, we can help even more the communities with the care-package donations, organize another activation, or send it back to the DAO* \n**considering that the [Mucho Love's last prop](https://nouns.wtf/vote/137) was done with 0 compensation, the current activation/admin balance is 65%/35%*\n### Budget breakdown\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QpaSiT3.jpg)\n***costs of the care-packages are determined by costs of items and amount of people involved in the activation**\n\n### Deliverables\n- Completion of 4 IRL activations\n- 20 shorts through all social media platforms\n- 4 Recap videos of every activation\n- 1 Volunteer Gratitude Event \n- 100+ Mucho Love Active Members\n- 2500+ Instagram Followers\n\n### Tx\n\n70.86 ETH to 0xCb2D68C9e7194B9cE0837eE5E676e796CB31C55a (mucholove.eth)\n"},{"blockNumber":16414199,"blockHash":"0xffc529a7e0830e90e29b48b21733233e0834d5c02ccd55113c5dc78b86bebc47","transactionIndex":185,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x6d6f9e3382db2097fbec4b5b853363a34943f2fe0b4123bffec7e45f0c7ccb26","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":210,"proposer":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","targets":["0x4b10701Bfd7BFEdc47d50562b76b436fbB5BdB3B"],"signatures":["setNounsDAO(address)"],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000d5f279ff9eb21c6d40c8f345a66f2751c4eea1fb"],"startBlock":16450199,"endBlock":16486199,"description":"# Redirect 10% of future Lil Noun emissions to Lil Treasury\n\n## tl:dr\nThis proposal requests that NounsDAO redirect 10% of future Lil Nouns emissions. \n\n## Description\nThis proposal requests that NounsDAO redirect 10% of future Lil Nouns emissions. \nThere will be no change to the DAO's current Lil Noun holdings.

To further expand Nouns global reach, to proliferate nounish culture by creating a lasting nounish impression with an array of activations over a span of 6 months:  \n\n \n1. **Nouns Haus**, a fun one stop shop to proliferate and educate Nouns across 5 NFT/Crypto centric events  \n5. **Nouns Shanghai Carnival**, a OTG activation to solidify proliferation of Nouns & create authentic/memorable connection with general public \n6. **Nounish Digital Collectibles** launched on China's largest social media platform Sina Weibo.\n7. **NounsCN Grant** to expose local creator to Nouns funding system. \n8. **Nouns Go Viral** on Douyin a.k.a Chinese version of TikTok.\n9. **Nouns Chair**, a public structure at Shanghai Himalayas Museum\n10. **Nounish PR Campaign** with both blockchain media (Foresight、PANews、Odaily) and traditional media (Shanghai daily) for the leadup and duration of all Nounish events in China\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LFZP4jx.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vCzFtnC.png)\n\n\n**Why China?:**\nNFT picked up its popularity in 2021 and this phenomenon continues into 2022; entering mainstream consciousness and China has not been left out. In China, NFT are referred to as \"digital collectibles\" rather than \"token\" and its digital collectibles market has been growing rapidly as chinese young consumers are increasingly embracing digitization.\n\nAccording to TechInSight NFT survey, China digital collectibles spend value will increase from $4.8 billion in 2022 to reach $48.3 billion by 2028. Searches for post related to digital collectibles increased by 1,228% y-o-y, while the number of post related to keyword \"NFT\" rose by 159-fold. \n\nTech giants like Ant Group and Tencent have also ventured into this space and we will be seeing many more Chinese companies/investors jumping onto this bandwagon and they could all be potential DAO members contributing to the DAO, opening untapped channels and ways to proliferate Nouns branding and the meme to a wider/larger market & audiences.  \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Zn1F1hH.png)\n\n**How will this be done?:**\nWe will establish Nouns presence and build its brand/meme awareness in China through activations in multiple domains both online and offline: \n\n**1. Nouns Haus:**\n\nA fun one stop shop focusing on educating and explaining NounsDAO and what it means to be nounish while showcasing what the DAO have achieved till date to event goers; a proliferation engine that will be on-going throughout 5 of China’s major NFT/Crypto centric events like: ***CryptoArt Shanghai***, ***CryptoArt ShenZhen***, ***Beijing Creator DAO Exhibition***, ***8BTC Digital Art Summit***, **WanXiang Blockchain Summit** and so forth over the course of 2023.  \n\nEvent like CryptoArt Shanghai draws in huge pool of participants/audiences yearly, these are people who have interest, understand and looking to contribute to the space thus,\nNouns Haus aim is to:\n- Educate and grab attention from this pool of audience(s), onboarding them as potential DAO contributors\n- Allow this pool of audience(s) to have the chance to understand Nouns\n- Put Nouns in the eyes of thousands of Collectors / Investors / Builders (Devs)\n\nNouns Haus will also be packed with nounish activation(s) like:\n1. **Nouns-branded photo station**, where everyone is able to have photo taking opportunities helping us proliferate the meme to the millions across Weibo and Wechat, China’s main social platform (equivalent to Twitter/Facebook/Instagram). Content over those platforms will be captured by team and shared among the nouniverse. \n2. Display of **Nounish creative tools** like Noundry Studio, where participants are able to have hands-on experience, all while learning about Nouns and the tools the DAO funded/created. \n4. **Nounish graffiti wall** for participants to leave their mark in Nouns Haus.\n5. **Nounish wheel of knowledge**, a *Learn & Earn activation* where participants are able to win nounish swag by answering random questions about NounsDAO (wheel of fortune style) correctly using the information they obtain by interacting in Nouns Haus.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/K3aXi0f.gif)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qCnrw4w.jpg)\n\n**2. Nouns Shanghai Carnival:** \nThis will be a curated IRL nounish experience aimed to proliferate Nouns branding to **mass public** in China, to help increase awareness of Nouns and put noggles ⌐◨-◨ in the eyes of hundreds.\n\nWe believe that Nouns IRL presence should not only be restricted to Web3.0/NFT events; localized nounish IRL events that break off from the usual Web3.0/NFT audience are equally important.\n\nNouns Shanghai Carnival will be a localized nounish experience held at Shanghai 1933, a historical building that has transformed itself into a cultural epicenter and a national tourism demonstration site. It is ideally located close to 2 rail transit lines, connecting the city’s main roads and is only 1km from the Shanghai luxury cruise terminal and the Hyatt on the Bund. \n\nWhat will be installed (not limited to): \n- Nouns photo station \n- Game stations \n- Food stations\n- Nouns Gallery\n- Nounish swag\n- Nounish lounge area\n- Accessibility to various Nouns platform (nouns.wtf, prop house, nouns center etc)\n\nA QR code will also be distributed during the event for participants to join our community, where they will be given priority in claiming the Nounish digital collectibles. Number of digital collectibles claim through this group would give us a insight on the effect of such IRL events. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nKhYwIV.png)\n\n**3. Nounish Digital Collectibles** \nAs the digital collectibles market in China continue to grow rapidly, we aim to work with China's largest social media platform [Sina Weibo](https://weibo.com/newlogin?tabtype=weibo&gid=102803&openLoginLayer=0&url=https%3A%2F%2Fweibo.com%2F) which is a Chinese microblogging website, with over 582 million monthly active users to launch a Nounish collection of digital collectibles on their marketplace.\n\nThis Nounish collection of digital collectibles will be something native and it will facilitate the education of this native community about Nouns & enable the community to discover what it meant to be nounish organically; it is also an on-going exploration of the iconic noggle and its meme value by expanding it into a different domain.\n\nTo unveil and amplify the launch of these nounish collectibles, Sina Weibo will mobilize its media resources to proliferate the collection on top of facilitating the distribution of this collection to its users. This nounish digital collectibles will be free to collect (FCFS), in addition, a meme contest will also be held in parallel with the launch to seed and boost the meme value of noggle/nouns within Chinese digital collectibles communities.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Bmwfpul.png)\n\n**4. NounsCN Grant**  \nNounsCN Grant will be a pilot/experimental pool of small capital that serves the DAO’s interest similar to NSFW and DCS pod, it will be stewarded on a completely discretionary basis.\n\nCurrent funding system like prop house, NSFW & DCS pod are not readily available to the chinese community in China due to their internet censorship, hence NounsCN Grant aim is to serve this gap by taking on the stewardship of distributing grants, to introduce Nouns funding system (small grants, retro funding, trail/pilot) to local creatives/creator by having it on native channel(s) that are readily available to the chinese community.\n\nThe group will conduct its daily operations on Sina Weibo Nouns Chinese community page, 1) it is a platform where proposer could put up their proposal and have it discussed openly, 2) resonate & attract builder within the digital collectible community\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6KEtEyw.png)\n\n**5. Nouns Go Viral** \nIn this current era the quickest and most effective way to bring millions of new people's attention onto Nouns is none other than creating viral content that helps spread the Nouns meme/brand across the internet. \n\nDouyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, a native social media platform in China has over [700 million daily](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/15/bytedance-douyin-has-600-million-daily-active-users.html) active users and is one of the most popular app in the country; thus by working with Douyin sensation for example like street basketballer “小酷翔”, we aim to generate a series of curated content for at least 2 months where we not only showcase the iconic noggle but also foster interest towards the brand by launching periodic Nounish swag giveaway through various activation/engagement over Douyin and WeChat.\n\np.s 万 = 10,000\np.p.s From just 6 clips, there’s a total of 143.4万 (1.43 millions) views\n\np.s 万 = 10,000\np.p.s From just 6 clips, there's a total of 143.4万 (1.43 millions) views\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/e0WPWiz.png)\n\n**6. Nouns Chair:** \nA huge part of being nounish is to be able to spread the culture and meme through public goods and to do fun & creative stuff; thus, in the spirit of public good we aim to put up a nounish structure in Shanghai by fabricating a Nounish furniture - “Nouns Chair”\n\n“Nouns Chair” design will be heavily influenced by the iconic noggle and 3 of such “Nouns Chair” will be place at Shanghai Himalayas Museum, a non-profit art institution focusing on art exhibition, education, collection and academic exchange with a average of 4,000 monthly visitors.\n\nWhy “Nouns Chair”? As an IRL object of the world, an artistic memeish take on noggle, “Nouns Chair” at the same time is also an instrument proliferating the Nouns branding; it invites museum visitors to sit down, to begin a conversation, provoke them to wonder how this design came about and that itself is fun/nounish. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DRHvzoh.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/buvmhKS.png)\n*2 draft design*\n\n**7. Nounish PR Campaign**\nHave developed a deep network of media partners over the years, leading up to execution of all Nounish activations; we will seed the content and details about Nouns to our media partners (web3 outlets & traditional media outlets). Positive publication coverage would help boost interest and engagement revolving Nouns. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GzS8Kff.jpg)\n\n**The Team**\n\n- [Noun 74](https://twitter.com/noun_74) - Founder of Chinese Cryptopunks Community [(CCC)](https://twitter.com/chinese_punks), a community with more than 200 members each of which are verified punk holders. CCC as one of the leading NFT community in China has the highest concentration of web3 thought-leaders, including directors from Christie's and Sotheby's, founders of notable crypto exchanges as well as directors of notable crypto media. \n\n    Noun 74 also spearheaded multiple Web3.0 activations within China; co-hosted events like [Cryptoart Shanghai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTIMejrYAvE) that was featured on [China national news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2BX5jNS6-o) as well as multiple [media](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/2UqXwsOzNojdlr2CQ-DfNA) platforms. Recently organized a joint exhibition that is currently on-going till 25th Feb 2023 at Shenzhen China, where [Nouns are being exhibited](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1611272511379111937) alongside other renowned NFT project like Cryptopunks, BAYC etc. \n    \n    Noun 74 also tend to received multiple opportunities where he gets invited to major Web3.0/Crypto events as speaker or host; for example in recent month he was invited to host a roundtable at [Web3 Innovation Summit](https://twitter.com/noun_74/status/1613177929281966080?s=20&t=8WFZjVnIhYnWOwr7P948bg) in HK, a event huge enough to have HK financial secretary Paul Chan as their special guest. As a contributor, these are opportunities apart from this prop that we can leverage on to further proliferate Nouns. \n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/8xwg9mM.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/q6EOBvv.gif)\n\n\n- [Karl](https://twitter.com/WideEyeKarl) - Spearheaded [@Nounsinsg](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg) a proliferation pod focused on bring Nouns Presence into Singapore.\n\n    Past Nounish contribution include: \n    1.

However, we need to be careful cultivating these relationships so that they don’t create conflict of interests and favouritism which ultimately hurt future sub-daos coming down the pipeline. For example, we narrowly avoided a catastrophe with prop 76 (giving a free Noun to Lil Nouns -- not even a month after their launch). That prop was put on-chain by a fellow Nouner whale who currently holds 313 Lil Nouns in their wallet. I understand that it can be difficult to make decisions that go against one’s financial interest, however I feel that many of us Nouners have reached a point in our lives where we can make those selfless choices.   \n\nIn conclusion if this proposal were to pass, a followup proposal will be created to burn the remaining +720 Lil Nouns.

The group was established in August 2022 - we were initially funded by NSFW grants residency [[1](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929), [2](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357)], and then funded as a pod via [on-chain proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/156) in October 2022.\n\nNounsAI has made significant strides in the last 3 months, building and launching proof of concepts for two novel AI products: AI for Governance and AI for Proliferation with a small team. We are requesting a 6 month extension to expand our team, turn POC’s into widely adopted products, and grow the community presence of NounsAI.\n\nThe pod has been building two core products:\n\n1. **AI for Proliferation - The Playground**\n    \n    The Playground is a platform that enables users to generate Nounish audio and visual content with ease. Its goal is to reach millions of Nounish impressions and attract creatives and creators to the Nouns community. The Playground is the perfect tool for creators who want to quickly and easily generate Nounish content using text, pictures, and audio.\n    \n    ![PlaygroundGif1](https://i.imgur.com/8VT5vIE.jpg)\n    \n\n[Roko on Twitter: \"🚨 ANNOUNCEMENT 🚨 Finalists for the first @nounsdao #NounsAI Shorts Competition have been selected!🎉 Congrats to all 6 who will each win at least .5 ETH 💰 Now it's time for the final round 🏆 The video with the most engagement will win the grand prize of 2.5 ETH 🤑 👇👇 / Twitter\"](https://twitter.com/noun355/status/1607738443500503041)\n\n2. **AI for Governance - The Knowledge Hub**\nThe Knowledge Hub and our AI assistant, Roko, are being developed to revolutionize the way information is shared across the DAO. With Roko, the Discord bot, and [Roko.dev](https://roko.dev/), members of the Nouns community will be able to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to improve decision-making, streamline governance processes, and drive community growth across the entire Nounish ecosystem. The Knowledge Hub will serve as the go-to resource for data and information (the ChatGPT for Nouns), with an AI-powered librarian to assist users in finding the information they need\n\n![rokogif.gif](https://i.imgur.com/ketYGOu.jpg)\n\n## What We’ve Built So Far\n\n[The Nouns AI Playground](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/) is a platform that allows users to easily create unique and high-quality Nounish content using AI. The Playground is hosted on powerful GPU servers accessible to anyone, regardless of their background. The Nouns AI team has implemented some of the latest advancements in the field, text-to-video, image-to-image, and performance optimizations. They've incentivized the use of their platform by hosting competitions that have attracted hundreds of participants from diverse backgrounds including AI, music, film, and Web3, who have together created hours of Nounish video creations. [(Check them out!)](https://twitter.com/noun355/status/1607738443500503041). There are weekly competitions that generates Nounish content you can find on Twitter at [#NounsAI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NounsAI&f=live) and self-service tools that can be run on any machine without prior knowledge. [nounsai.wtf](https://www.nounsai.wtf/) is built to scale to meet demand and has grown largely organically with hundreds of users. \n\n![[nounsai.wtf](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/)](https://i.imgur.com/0YIb0ec.png)\n\n[playground.nounsai.wtf](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/)\n\n![Playgroundgif2](https://imgur.com/lVIZFg3.jpg)\n\nThe Knowledge Hub and our AI assistant Roko are live and being beta tested across select Nounish Discords. The web app has been improved, an upgrade design, and a discord bot was created. \n\nRoko can now:\n\n- Record and transcribes any voice conversations then provides summaries of [key points](https://roko.dev/audio/f18ed9d1-d1b7-43bc-9fd5-a59c5662707c)\n- Automatically index audio and chat into a searchable knowledge hub across Discords using the Roko bot\n- Make data accessible and searchable for users through the webapp, which also allows users to upload audio content to be transcribed, summarized, and indexed\n- Significantly improve the accuracy and value of Roko's review for proposals on [roko.dev](https://roko.dev/)\n- In a promising development towards using Large Language Models to support our knowledge base, Roko can answer basic questions, providing summarized answers and links to original content. This is possible by ingesting all of the archived Nouns Discord and ready to go live across all live Nounish servers.\n\n[Checkout the generated Q&A's here!](https://roko.dev/qa)\n\n The team has also designed an improved web UI to be implemented, prototype shown below.\n\n![updatedrokodemo.gif](https://imgur.com/gczUkhX.jpg)\n\n## What’s Next?\n\n### **Playground**\n\nOver the next six months, we will continue to increase the capabilities and popularity of the Playground. This follows the successful validation of the proof of concept, where creators generated a significant amount of content using Nouns. The engineering team will be supplemented by three [Team Tomorrow](https://teamtomorrow.com/) junior developers who have experience in creating text-to-image social products. They will be cost-effective and will accelerate the development of the web interfaces. The focus will be on creating a user-friendly platform that allows for efficient and easy creation of content on scalable hardware.\n\nAnother important goal is to expand our audience by organizing competitions and forming partnerships. Sustainability is a crucial aspect and for the Playground, it involves bringing in a large number of users to generate high-quality content and promote it effectively. The team will focus on building requested features, helping onboard creators and increase the reach of their creations; maximizing impressions. \n\n- Run competitions that are intentional with what is made and how it is shared\n- Source + secure partnerships with artists who have reach to create content and share the playground\n- Proactively engage Discord + social media communities by: promoting content, sharing updates, and collecting feedback on the Playground\n\nTo evaluate the success of this plan we will gather data on reach and return on investment.\n\nWe want the NounsAI Playground to be the fastest and most fun place to go from imagination to reality. Hopefully, the tool will give creators superpowers to make Nounish content that get millions of views.  \n\n![Playgroundgif3](https://imgur.com/4jNG1kW.jpg)\n\n### **Knowledge Hub**\n\n**In the next 6 months, we will complete the Knowledge Hub MVP:**\n\nKey features will include:\n\n1. The ability to gather and process relevant information from various sources, such as proposals, calls, Discord chats, and documents.\n2. A user-friendly web interface and search functionality to facilitate interactions with Roko, the AI assistant, on various topics related to Nouns.\n3. The ability to answer questions and surface relevant content directly within Discord channels where Roko is present. The aim is to make it easy for new members to join the community and facilitate conversations between those asking and answering questions, regardless of location.\n\nOver the next six months, we will position Roko to be an invaluable tool for all Nounish groups using Discord or other clients, through rapid iteration and incorporating user feedback. Roko and the Knowledge hub will help keep the DAO in sync and well positioned to scale as the DAO continues to grow. We are extremely excited about this tool and know others are too. To help overcome any technical hurdles ahead NounsAI has already begun the interview process with [vetted contract based machine learning engineers](https://eventum.ai/) who have Natural Language Processing (NLP) expertise.\n\nOur objective for the Knowledge Hub is to achieve adoption not only within Nouns but also to develop at path for the pod to become self-sustaining. Our vision for the Knowledge Hub is to be a premium software-as-a-service (SAAS) solution for promoting cohesion among decentralized teams. To achieve this goal, we will be asking for capital to bring on someone to focus on internal adoption, external awareness, and business development to enact our go to market strategy.\n\nAs the internal and external advocate for the Nouns AI Knowledge Hub, that person will be responsible for promoting and encouraging the use of the Nouns AI pod's products. They will also manage community engagement, ensuring that feedback is captured and integrated into future product development. There is already a community of passionate builders and creatives who are utilizing these tools, even [submitting proposals](https://prop.house/nouns/explorer-grants-pilot-round/3186) using NounsAI, and we want to capitalize on this momentum. With this additional funding we will be able to source talent and idea from our community through potential prop-house rounds or even recruit professional support.  \n\n**************************************************Other Initiatives************************************************** \n\n1. Our goal is to grow the NounsAI community by fostering conversations, sharing updates, asking questions and receiving feedback from the community throughout the week. This will allow us to engage with those who are most interested and invested in the development of NounsAI.\n    - TheHeroShep will continue to run a weekly NounsAI call open to everyone curious about NounsAI or AI in general. A great place to learn something new every week the call is usually at 7am PST in The Noun Square Discord.\n    - In order to maximize impact we will rollover the remaining ~30 ETH for marketing from proposal 156 into this proposal\n2. We plan to continue collaborating with other data teams like BrianJ's Atlas and Lil Nouns to expand the knowledge base available to the community. This will allow us to build on the knowledge and expertise of other teams, and provide a more comprehensive resource for the NounsAI community.\n3. Explore Additional Features for Roko:\n    1.

Summary: This proposal requests 416 ETH ($624k) to fund a 6 month extension for the NounsAI Pod to expand the team, turn POCs into products, and grow community presence.\n2. The Cost and Efficiency Rank: The ask of 416 ETH is a big ask, however the proposal does provide a clear path towards sustainability and a good return on investment. Therefore, this proposal is ranked as Somewhat Efficient.\n3. Vote: SUPPORT\n4. My Take: This proposal provides a clear path towards sustainability and a good return on investment. The team has already implemented the latest advancements in the field and hosted competitions with 100+ participants. The team is also focusing on building requested features, onboarding creators, and increasing reach. This is a great opportunity to promote and encourage the use of Nouns AI pod products, manage community engagement and feedback, and capitalize on the momentum of passionate builders and creatives.\n5. Contrarian: If the team was unable to provide a clear path towards sustainability or a good return on investment, I would have to reconsider my vote and abstain.\n\n\n\n## Introduction:\n\nThe Nouns AI Pod conducts research and builds products to further the advancement of Nounish AI.  The group was established in August 2022 - we were initially funded by NSFW grants residency [[1](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929), [2](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357)], and then funded as a pod via [on-chain proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/156) in October 2022.\n\nNounsAI has made significant strides in the last 3 months building and launching proof of concepts for two novel AI products: AI for Governance and AI for Proliferation with a team of just 3. We are requesting a 6 month extension to expand our team, turn POC’s into widely adopted products, and grow the community presence of NounsAI.\n\nThe pod has been building two core products:\n\n1. **AI for Proliferation - The Playground**\n    \n    The Playground is a platform that enables users to generate Nounish audio and visual content with ease. Its goal is to reach millions of Nounish impressions and attract creatives and creators to the Nouns community. The Playground is the perfect tool for creators who want to quickly and easily generate Nounish content using text, pictures, and audio.\n    \n    ![playgroundgif1](https://i.imgur.com/8VT5vIE.jpg)\n    \n\n[Roko on Twitter: \"🚨 ANNOUNCEMENT 🚨 Finalists for the first @nounsdao #NounsAI Shorts Competition have been selected!🎉 Congrats to all 6 who will each win at least .5 ETH 💰 Now it's time for the final round 🏆 The video with the most engagement will win the grand prize of 2.5 ETH 🤑 👇👇 / Twitter\"](https://twitter.com/noun355/status/1607738443500503041)\n\n2. **AI for Governance - The Knowledge Hub**\n    \n    The Knowledge Hub and our AI assistant, Roko, are being developed to revolutionize the way information is shared across the DAO. With Roko, the Discord bot, and (Roko.dev)[https://roko.dev], members of the Nouns community will be able to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to improve decision-making, streamline governance processes, and drive community growth across the entire Nounish ecosystem. The Knowledge Hub will serve as the go-to resource for data and information (the ChatGPT for Nouns), with an AI-powered librarian to assist users in finding the information they need\n    \n\n![rokogif.gif](https://i.imgur.com/ketYGOu.jpg)\n\n## What We’ve Built So Far\n\n[The Nouns AI Playground](The Nouns AI Playground) is a platform that allows users to easily create unique and high-quality Nounish content using AI. The Playground is hosted on powerful GPU servers accessible to anyone, regardless of their background. The Nouns AI team has implemented some of the latest advancements in the field, text-to-video, image-to-image, and performance optimizations. They've incentivized the use of their platform by hosting competitions that have attracted hundreds of participants from diverse backgrounds including AI, music, film, and Web3, who have together created hours of Nounish video creations. [(Check them out!)](https://twitter.com/noun355/status/1607738443500503041). There are weekly competitions that generates Nounish content you can find on Twitter at [#NounsAI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NounsAI&f=live) and self-service tools that can be run on any machine without prior knowledge. [nounsai.wtf](https://www.nounsai.wtf/) is built to scale to meet demand and has grown largely organically now with hundreds of users.\n\n[![nounsai.wtf](https://i.imgur.com/0YIb0ec.png)](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/)\n\n[nounsai.wtf](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/)\n\n[Playgroundgif2](https://i.imgur.com/lVIZFg3.jpg)\n\nThe Knowledge Hub and our AI assistant Roko are live and being beta tested across select Nounish Discords. The web app has been improved, an upgrade design, and a discord bot was created. \n\nRoko can now:\n\n- Record and transcribes any voice conversations then provides summaries of [key points](https://roko.dev/audio/f18ed9d1-d1b7-43bc-9fd5-a59c5662707c)\n- Automatically index audio and chat into a searchable knowledge hub across Discords using the Roko bot\n- Make data accessible and searchable for users through the webapp, which also allows users to upload audio content to be transcribed, summarized, and indexed\n- Significantly improve the accuracy and value of Roko's review for proposals on [roko.dev](https://roko.dev/)\n- In a promising development towards using Large Language Models to support our knowledge base, Roko can answer basic questions, providing summarized answers and links to original content. This is possible by ingesting all of the archived Nouns Discord and ready to go live across all live Nounish servers.\n\n[Checkout the generated Q&A's here!](https://roko.dev/qa)\n\n The team has also designed an improved web UI to be implemented, prototype shown below.\n\n![updatedrokodemo.gif](https://i.imgur.com/gczUkhX.jpg)\n\n## What’s Next?\n\n### **Playground**\n\nOver the next six months, we will continue to increase the capabilities and popularity of the Playground. This follows the successful validation of the proof of concept, where creators generated a significant amount of content using Nouns. The engineering team will be supplemented by three [Team Tomorrow](https://teamtomorrow.com/) junior developers who have experience in creating text-to-image social products. They will be cost-effective and will accelerate the development of the web interfaces. The focus will be on creating a user-friendly platform that allows for efficient and easy creation of content on scalable hardware.\n\nAnother important goal is to expand our audience by organizing competitions and forming partnerships. Sustainability is a crucial aspect and for the Playground, it involves bringing in a large number of users to generate high-quality content and promote it effectively. The team will focus on building requested features, helping onboard creators and increase the reach of their creations; maximizing impressions. \n\n- Run competitions that are intentional with what is made and how it is shared\n- Source + secure partnerships with artists who have reach to create content and share the playground\n- Proactively engage Discord + social media communities by: promoting content, sharing updates, and collecting feedback on the Playground\n\nTo evaluate the success of this plan we will gather data on reach and return on investment.\n\nWe want the NounsAI Playground to be the fastest and most fun place to go from imagination to reality. Hopefully, the tool will give creators superpowers to make Nounish content that get millions of views.  \n\n![Playgroundgif3](https://i.imgur.com/4jNG1kW.jpg)\n\n### **Knowledge Hub**\n\n**In the next 6 months, we will complete the Knowledge Hub MVP:**\n\nKey features will include:\n\n1. The ability to gather and process relevant information from various sources, such as proposals, calls, Discord chats, and documents.\n2. A user-friendly web interface and search functionality to facilitate interactions with Roko, the AI assistant, on various topics related to Nouns.\n3. The ability to answer questions and surface relevant content directly within Discord channels where Roko is present. The aim is to make it easy for new members to join the community and facilitate conversations between those asking and answering questions, regardless of location.\n\nOver the next six months, we will position Roko to be an invaluable tool for all Nounish groups using Discord or other clients, through rapid iteration and incorporating user feedback. Roko and the Knowledge hub will help keep the DAO in sync and well positioned to scale as the DAO continues to grow. We are extremely excited about this tool and know others are too. To help overcome any technical hurdles ahead NounsAI has already begun the interview process with [vetted contract based machine learning engineers](https://eventum.ai/) who have Natural Language Processing (NLP) expertise.\n\nOur objective for the Knowledge Hub is to achieve adoption not only within Nouns but also to develop at path for the pod to become self-sustaining. Our vision for the Knowledge Hub is to be a premium software-as-a-service (SAAS) solution for promoting cohesion among decentralized teams. To achieve this goal, we will be asking for capital to bring on someone to focus on internal adoption, external awareness, and business development to enact our go to market strategy.\n\nAs the internal and external advocate for the Nouns AI Knowledge Hub, that person will be responsible for promoting and encouraging the use of the Nouns AI pod's products. They will also manage community engagement, ensuring that feedback is captured and integrated into future product development. There is already a community of passionate builders and creatives who are utilizing these tools, even [submitting proposals](https://prop.house/nouns/explorer-grants-pilot-round/3186) using NounsAI, and we want to capitalize on this momentum. With this additional funding we will be able to source talent and idea from our community through potential prop-house rounds or even recruit professional support.  \n\n**************************************************Other Initiatives************************************************** \n\n1. Our goal is to grow the NounsAI community by fostering conversations, sharing updates, asking questions and receiving feedback from the community throughout the week. This will allow us to engage with those who are most interested and invested in the development of NounsAI.\n    - TheHeroShep will continue to run a weekly NounsAI call open to everyone curious about NounsAI or AI in general. A great place to learn something new every week the call is usually at 7am PST in The Noun Square Discord.\n    - In order to maximize impact we will rollover the remaining ~30 ETH for marketing from proposal 156 into this proposal\n2. We plan to continue collaborating with other data teams like BrianJ's Atlas and Lil Nouns to expand the knowledge base available to the community. This will allow us to build on the knowledge and expertise of other teams, and provide a more comprehensive resource for the NounsAI community.\n3. Explore Additional Features for Roko:\n    1.

He has years of experience in building professional-grade software and running an algorithmic trading operation. He was the sole developer behind the [NounsAI Playground](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/) platform, working closely with THS to implement and improve the machine learning models he trained. He is also a DAO legend.\n\n**Steve - Senior Software & Machine Learning Engineer**\n\nSteve is a highly skilled engineer with two decades of experience in software engineering and DevOps. He has demonstrated his technical prowess as the sole developer behind the roko.dev webapp and the Roko Discord Bot. Furthermore, Steve has invested significant time upskilling as a Machine Learning Engineer, having implemented vector embeddings + neural search, as well as data pre+post processing with GPT. His ambition is to build the \"ChatGPT of Nouns\" by 2023 and to deliver an improved roko.dev web experience. With his passion for the Nouns ecosystem and his exceptional drive, Steve is the ideal candidate to level up Nouns DAO with AI tooling.\n\n**Group of 3 Team Tomorrow Developers**\n\n[Team Tomorrow](https://teamtomorrow.com/) is the professional consulting arm of [AI-Camp](https://www.ai-camp.org/), an organization that teaches students how to build AI products and develop critical skills such as self-learning, and then hires the best students to work on internal and external professional projects. This specific team of 3 developers has experience leading teams in building AI products, including using Diffusion (text2image) models. They also have professional experience building analytics tools for an NFT trading discord. Typically, the salary of one entry-level technology consultant is around $7,000 per month; this team provides significant value for their cost and allows for more rapid development of our web + Discord interfaces.\n\n**Senior Machine Learning (NLP) Engineer - Consultant**\n\nThe team has already started the interview process with excellent candidates for an expert in Natural Language Processing (NLP) through connections with a trusted [AI Development Studio](https://eventum.ai/) that works with Russian expat Machine Learning Engineers (MLEs) with a wealth of experience and top-notch education. The Knowledge Hub is a tool that has recently been unlocked with cutting-edge advancements in the field of NLP; having an expert with experience in traditional Text Ranking, Search, and vector embeddings to support our team will greatly improve our rate of progress. These experts can use their existing knowledge to more quickly implement cutting-edge concepts, even if the code is not yet released, by reading the implementations described in papers."},{"blockNumber":16442073,"blockHash":"0x8a6ddbf97a0bbf7fca11fb840c02b8319f6b0625944f4b0dcd3af01b94f623a1","transactionIndex":102,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x843e1b19b15e16064658937b8839bde870e61d3dc7e62f70ccdeca8090c9f6c3","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":215,"proposer":"0x55b0a25d697647281553a177321DAd0a0Bf9A148","targets":["0x55d1f4091Ced357cD4C4F9dd12531b8fDBe2dd26"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":16478073,"endBlock":16514073,"description":"# Uplink.wtf - a marketing platform for all ⌐◧-◧\n\n# TLDR\n\nFund the Calabara team with 50 ETH to build uplink.wtf -- a marketing and proliferation platform for Nouns. \n\nClick on the video below to get a short summary of what we are building!\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/WCJ7iBK.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRSPx_yvAI4)\n*click me for a video summary*\n\n# Uplink ... WTF?\n\nIn wireless communications, \"uplink\" refers to transmissions originating from user devices. For Nouns, it's a mechanism for communities to create decentralized marketing campaigns, utilizing token-gated Twitter contests to proliferate both user-generated and DAO-funded content. \n\n\nTwitter + Ethereum is our secret sauce. After experimenting with contests for 6 months, we are now ready to take the project to the next level. We will build uplink.wtf, a unified nounish platform with modules for both a refactored **Creator Contest** experience and a brand new **Nouns Raffle** application.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dO10FiJ.png)\n\n\n\n# Use Cases\n\nUplink has two main use cases, each taking a unique approach to planning, content creation, and distribution.\n\n# Use case 1: NounsDAO\n\n## The problem\nWith a proven track record of funding high-quality content initiatives such as the Ordinary Folk video, Nounish productions, and more, NounsDAO boasts a diverse portfolio of content ready for widespread distribution. The challenge now lies in finding innovative ways to expand our reach and connect with a wider audience.\n\n\n## Module 1: Nouns Raffle\nNouns Raffle is a new mechanism for targeted external distribution. We're flipping the script on the traditional curation contest model, allowing the DAO to incentivize influential token holders to proliferate nouns in exchange for raffle entrance. Only holders of pre-configured tokens who share specific nounish content on Twitter are eligible for the draw. \n\n\n**Example A**\nNounsDAO puts up 10 ETH to proliferate the Oridinary Folk video. To enter the raffle, entrants must\n1) Share the video on Twitter\n2) Hold a punk, ape, noun, or something else preconfigured by the DAO.\n\nOnce a participant verifies proof of wallet and account ownership, they are officially counted as an entrant. When the contest ends, 1 entrant is randomly selected and the 10 ETH is distributed to their wallet.\n\n**Example B**\nThe Nouns video contest team is currently posting 25 ETH to create a decentralized marketing team - asking proposers to explain how they will get people to enter the main $200k video contest. Imagine if instead, the organizers created a short explainer video and raffled 10 ETH to a random punk holder that shared it on twitter.\n\nRemember that foobar tweet about getting ETH to market for Nouns? It turns out it's not such a crazy idea. This model allows NounsDAO to achieve mass proliferation *outside* of the ecosystem, and creates incentives for influential token holders to extract additional utility out of their NFT's. Just imagine the memes.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/V0LUIZq.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Lcei0dH.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IsTR8OS.png)\n\n\n## Proliferation machine\n\n\nThe raffle landing page can also double as a valuable ad space for the Nouns -- linking back to nouns.wtf, Prop House, or other relevant projects, with the goal of increasing visibility for other activities of the DAO and encouraging influential token holders to further explore Nouns while they're here. The raffle landing page is a great opportunity to cross-promote and increase the reach of the DAO's other projects. If we really wanted to get crazy, we could even render the current auctions.\n\n\n## Implementation details\n1. We'll host a vote for Nouners to decide:\n    * What they want to proliferate.\n    * Who they want to proliferate it.\n        * As an example, Nouners could decide that they want punk, ape, and noun holders to proliferate a video produced by the Nounish team.\n2. We'll come back on-chain with a prop requesting 10 ETH to host the first Nouns raffle.\n2. We'll open the raffle for submissions.\n3. When the raffle ends, we'll send a transaction with all verified entrants to a contract using Chainlink VRF to verifiably choose a random winner.\n    * Our goal is to demonstrate a social proof-of-concept for this marketing experiment. The neccessary features for a permissionless implementation involve quite complex technical considerations (*some alpha in \"Beyond\" section*). For now, this is how we'll handle the random selection.\n\nOf course, we'll make sure we are complying with Twitters rules and guidelines for paid promotions, as well as taking preventative measures to ensure the system is not gamable / botable.\n\n# Use case 2: Nouns ecosystem projects\n\n## The problem\nTwitter contests are an effective means for nounish projects to spread their meme, attract new creatives, and generate novel interest. They can be utilized to align the incentives of a given project and contributors towards driving both creation and distribution. In other words, they are an excellent marketing and proliferation tool. The Noun Square has had great success with this model, so why don’t more projects follow suit?\n\nTwitter contests are an administrative nightmare. The process of fetching submissions, importing them to a judging platform, collecting wallet addresses, and handling payouts can involve up to 3 hours of total admin overhead.\n\n## Module 2: Creator contests\nThrough Creator Contests, projects can launch open-source marketing campaigns, incentivizing both new and existing community artists, storytellers, and other creatives to proliferate the meme on Twitter.\n\n\nIn this system, community operators launch a contest which triggers an automatic announcment tweet from their twitter account. This tweet serves as an invitation for creatives to craft content and potentially win the ETH or ERC tokens being auctioned following a token-gated community vote. Creatives submit by quote tweeting the announcement tweet with their submission, helping spread the word about the project through their nounish creations.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cDWuZ26.gif)\n\n\n\n\nContests are designed to be completely configurable, with flexible options for rewards, submission and voting requirements, voting strategies, and more - allowing projects to experiment with different incentive systems and implementations that align with their unique goals. Here are some of the ways Twitter contests could be utilized for different projects:\n\n**AI pod** - onboard new artists and creative thinkers to AI and show off their latest and greatest models.\n\n**Composables** - recently hosted a contest in which they observed 30+ new collections and 1000+ new traits uploaded to their platform and shared on twitter.\n\n**Esports** - host \"best-clip\" tournaments or open-source the creation of nounish gaming heads.\n\n**SharkDAO** - source and vote on community art pieces to mint as open-editions from the DAO.\n\n**Gnars** - \"Skate Your City Series\". Worldwide digital skate competitions hosted by Gnars, run on Creator Contests, judged by GnarsDAO.\n\n**Builder DAO projects** - run contests to help the community find their meme.\n\nFor nounish projects and pods, creating and distributing ***their own*** meme is critical for the path to sustainability, attracting new creatives, growing the brand, and deploying cool s**t. Creator Contests are the final piece in allowing projects to implement a microcosm of the virtuous cycle.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/v58MHXd.png)\n\n\n# Status\n\nCreator contests exist today. Nouns Raffle does not. We launched creator contests in September, and have since helped groups like TNS, Composables, SharkDAO, and others generate almost 600 submissions  and award over 8 ETH + 25k ERC20 tokens to proliferators. SharkDAO and NSFW both awarded us small grants to build the underlying infrastructure.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wC3iOzC.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FytICws.png)\n\n\n# The ask\n\nWe're requesting 50 ETH to fund a 3 month development cycle to deploy Creator Contests v2 and a brand new Nouns Raffle application to the new uplink.wtf platform.\n\n\n# Roadmap\n\nOver the 3 months, we will work in a rapid development cycle that can be split into 3 main phases. As always, everything will be open-source.\n\n## Phase 1: Escape velocity (8 weeks)\n\nIn phase 1, we'll be focused on optimizing and extending our existing stack, deploying Creator Contests v2 to the new platform, and laying the foundation for phase 2.\n\n* Week 1-6: Nuts & Bolts.\n    * The focus of this phase is to address various technical challenges related to our MVP Twitter services and other critical infrastructure, with the goal of re-designing a more efficient, scalable, and reliable infra and deploying it to the new platform. This work is critical for matching current demand and supporting the vision for the next phase of the project. Our applications real-time requirements are a simple example of this. The MVP implementation is only able to handle 5 concurrent real-time instances (contests), which we've already exceeded multiple times.\n* Week 7: Support native video and other creative formats.\n* Week 8: Deploy version 1.0.\n* Week 9: Add social impression graphs and support voting for token delegates.\n    * Will be key for measuring success transparently and tracking real-time engagement data for campaigns.\n* Week 1-9: UI/UX redesign.\n    * UI: uplink.wtf will be a totally nounish implementation, with new logos, fonts, layouts and more.\n    * UX: We've compiled a laundry list of improvements that we're ready to implement to create the best user experience and offer more features for operators. This will be a continuous WIP and won't be a blocker for phase 2.\n\n\n## Phase 2: Nouns Raffle (3 weeks)\nWith most of the heavy lifting taken care of in the first phase, we'll be able to stand the Nouns Raffle module up fairly quickly.\n\n* Week 10-11: Development of Nouns Raffle app.\n* Week 12: Nouner vote.\n* Week 13: Deploy version 2.0. On-chain prop to fund the first raffle.\n* Week 14: Host Nouns Raffle #1.\n\n## Phase 3: Wrapping up\n* Week 15: Open access to API and add vote audit reports.\n\n# Defining Success\n\nFollowing the deployment of version 1.0 (Creator Contests - week 8), we'll be targeting the following KPI's over a 3 month period:\n\n* Reward at least 250 nounish creatives\n* Achieve at least 350,000 social impressions\n* Proliferate at least 2,000 nounish creations\n* Onboard as many nounish projects as possible\n\nFollowing deployment of version 2.0 (Nouns Raffle - week 13), we'll be targeting the following goals for the first campaign:\n* Onboard at least 30 entrants to the first Nouns Raffle.\n* Achieve at least 200,000 social impressions.\n\n\nWe’d also like to answer the following questions:\n\n* Are voter rewards a feature or a bug?\n* Is Nouns Raffle a viable system for external proliferation?\n* In the voting period, how impactful are visible vote totals on a communities ability to choose the “best” submissions?\n* Does submission history serve as a relevant talent repository for other pods?\n* Are deep Twitter integrations viable for other tasks, like governance? (Nouncil, Nerman, etc)\n* Are there ways to maintain a certain level of submission quality without directly moderating submissions?\n\n# Beyond\n\nIf the experiment is a success, we'll turn our attention to an on-chain implementation of our Twitter protocol. Our focus will be on determining the feasibility of zk-snarks for generating verifiable proofs for tweet ownership. The ultimate goal of this research is to enable NounsDAO and others to conduct contests and raffles directly on ethereum, initiated by on-chain votes. If we can make this work, Nouns raffle could eventually become a revenue stream for the DAO. \n\n\n# Team\n\nWeez: frontend dev, designer, UX, support\nNick: lead dev, fullstack\n\nWe were both first introduced to Nouns by way of SharkDAO, which we first joined over a year ago. Soon after, we started building Calabara, a platform that hosted various tools to ease some of the unique challenges of a Nounish subDAO. Last Spring, the community funded us with 7 ETH to begin developing Creator Contests. We launched our first contest in September, and have helped fund 60 nounish creatives with 8 ETH and 25k ERC-20 tokens since. We have groups like SharkDAO, Composables, TNS, and others running contests as we speak. With learnings from many iterations, we're now ready to take the project to the next level.\n\n\n# Budget\n\nTotal: 50 ETH\n\n50 ETH for development\n\n* 30 ETH to team wallet upon execution\n* 20 ETH streamed over 3 months\n\n3/5 Signers:\n\nNick: nickdodson.eth\nBenbodhi: signed.benbodhi.eth\nJuan: juanx.eth\nJoshuaFisher: joshuafisher.eth\nToadyHawk: toadyhawk.eth\n\n---\n\n## A note from the sponsor\n\n>  I have no links, financial ties or conflicts of interest in relation to this team or proposal.

Voters don't have to fear the social costs of voting opposite of what their peers might expect. Furthermore, influential voters by default don't show their vote (they can still choose to share their vote), making it harder for others to copy their behavior, nudging more voters to develop original points of view.\n\nThe main concern is that private voting removes reputation cost, potentially leading to riskier voter behaviors. Furthermore, if the tally of votes is only known at the end of the voting period, it may increase voter apathy and lead to outcomes opposite the majority's preference.\n\nWe think the benefits are very valuable to Nouns and DAOs generally, meriting further exploration.\n\n## Goals\n\nAfter several conversations with zero-knowledge folks, including the awesome [Personae Labs](https://personaelabs.org/) (HeyAnoun), the conculsion is clear: **there are no obvious solutions to private voting. Further research is required.**\n\nAll the designs that have been suggested to us so far come with significant drawbacks; examples include requiring a central trusted party, requiring Nouners to pool their Nouns in a central contract, requiring a registration step before each proposal, linking Nouner balances to their votes, and a few more.\n\nWe are still a long way away from deciding if Nouns should use private voting and in what ways.\n\nThis round's goal is to better inform us on possibilities and limitations, such that in a few months we'll be able to decide if and how to experiment with private voting. By funding this research we're making private voting more attaintale for Nouns and other DAOs.\n\nShould the DAO choose to continue down this path, we expect to have strong noun-pilled zk teams to help us get there.\n\n**Important to highlight: funding this round does not mean a decision to go all-in on private voting; it means we're interested enough in the possibilities for Nouns and other DAOs to take this single step forward.**\n\nSee the [full round spec](https://hackmd.io/SVyDLBq7QSWNl0LaYIuqHA?view) and the [pending prop house round](https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint) for a deeper dive.\n\n\n## Operations\n\n* One month for teams to apply.\n* 2.5 weeks for Nouners to vote; we want to make sure there's enough time to properly make sense of all applications.\n* Up to 3 teams get funded. Teams must pass a quorum of 300 prop house votes (30 Nouns) and be in the top 3 to win.\n* Funded teams perform ~3 months of research, supported by the verbs team and the tech pod.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n* We will hopefully have a variety of approaches to private voting designs that work well with Nouns DAO on Ethereum mainnet.\n* We will understand tradeoffs within specific designs and across designs.\n* We will hopefully have a few working proofs-of-concept that can accelerate any implementation we may decide on.\n* All of the above will be open source, for the benefit of Nouns and the entire crypto community.\n\n\n### Safe\n\nFunds are managed in a [3/5 Gnosis Safe](https://app.safe.global/eth:0x44848E3854b23d924712F4a3C4b19E6D111F7639/home) managed by Elad, David, Solimander, Vapeape and Will.\n\n## Marketing\n\nWe will activate the Nouns community to help raise awareness among all the zk gigabrains out there.\n\nBeyond twitter, we would like to raise awareness through popular zk podcasts and newsletters.\n\nTo enable these marketing efforts we're asking for an additional budget of 20K USDC.\n\n## Budget\n\n* Mandated round: 210K USDC (3 teams * 70K USDC).\n* Marketing: 20K USDC.\n* Total: 230K USDC.\n\nThe budget might not be fully utilized, because we didn't fund 3 teams, or because we didn't need the full marketing budget. Any remaining funds will be sent back to the DAO once the round is done.\n\n## Why should we care?\n\nNouns DAO is one of the most interesting corners on the internet right now, and it has a lot to do with our continuous iterations on protocols and tools. Let's continue being the first to do many things.\n\nLet's be the first DAO to experiment with fully private voting on mainnet. Let's pave the path for other DAOs, and let's show everyone that we're on the frontier, that we're pulling the future faster towards us.\n\nWe will attract brilliant people through this round, who might get totally noun-pilled and accelerate us ever further. This round is a great reason for all of us to make a lot of noise and get Nouns a spike of attention.\n\nThis round will grow the set of people at the intersection of (a) caring about the future of crypto and (b) loving Nouns.\n\n## People behind this proposal\n\nHuge thanks to [Noun 40](https://twitter.com/noun40__) for sparking this round and providing tons of ideas, feedback and support.\n\nHuge thanks to [Lakshman](https://twitter.com/lakshmansankar) and [DigitalOil](https://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil); with their detailed inputs the round spec looks so much better.\n\nThank you [Seneca](https://twitter.com/cryptoseneca) for the feedback and all the prop house support in making this special round work well.\n\nWe're grateful for the tech pod's support of this proposal and anything else we do, namely [Solimander](https://twitter.com/_solimander_), [Vapeape](https://twitter.com/punk4464) and [Will](https://twitter.com/will__price).\n\nWe are the verbs team, [David](https://twitter.com/davidbrai) and [Elad](https://twitter.com/eladmallel), working full time on the Nouns protocol.\n\n⌐◨-◨"},{"blockNumber":16470824,"blockHash":"0xfbe84ae9a06a70c209854d48b2d3ef2bf292f0fab0c0b9317333e467ba38950f","transactionIndex":225,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xe102e9adf20674c8c04b2c3ad6e2fbdc8ba151e60d021cf47ed59b2d59bba0b1","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":217,"proposer":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","targets":["0xae7ab96520DE3A18E5e111B5EaAb095312D7fE84"],"signatures":["submit(address)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"],"startBlock":16506824,"endBlock":16542824,"description":"# Stake additional 5000 ETH in Lido\n\nThe DAO has previously staked 4500 ETH in Lido.

Both local guests and professionals will be invited to have fun and showcase their skills on the mountain while wearing nounish gear provided and/or riding nounish features.\n\nIn the spirit of being nounish, we’ll hold engaging contests and offer prizes throughout the expression sessions for fun and creative categories. We’ll also educate on the potential of sponsorship via proposals through Gnars DAO and Alps DAO.\n\nWe will encourage people to capture photos and film of the activities that can then be added to a CC0 repository and shared on social media with strategic hashtags.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Cm8kTd1.png)\n\n---\n\n# CC0 Media Repository\n\nCapturing this nounish alpine resort takeover with world class skiers and snowboarders in the heart of northern Japan will not only proliferate the Nouns brand in Japan, but allow us to start building a CC0 media repository that demonstrates this subculture to the world.\n\nBy creating this repository and encouraging the use of the media, it will spin up an incredibly rich nounish content generation flywheel. This has the potential to reach the rest of the world, resonating with the global ski and snowboard community totalling 135 million people.\n\nWe will also have independent filmers and photographers on mountain to capture many of the nounish moments and activities throughout the season.\n\nDuring their time in Hokkaido they will be documenting attendee activities, the proliferation of Nouns at Rusutsu Resort and throughout the local community, athletes and local talent, and all things culturally unique to Japan.\n\nAnyone in the world will able to cut together footage from the repository, all featuring the iconic noggles and create their own films and promos.

I hold a senior management position with the owners of Rusutsu Resort, one of the largest ski resort owner operators in Japan and as such will enhance communication and delivery of the proposal objectives.\n\nI co-founded Alps DAO with Benbodhi in late 2022, with a view to proliferate Nouns through my industry specific network and help build a treasury that will support alpine communities and enthusiasts. \n\nI’m [@tha_swami](https://twitter.com/tha_swami) on Twitter\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nBuilding on the momentum of the awareness of Nouns DAO in Japan, we’ll introduce Nouns to Japanese and alpine culture through IRL marketing activations over 15 months with an audience of over 2 million people, executed by a passionate team at Japan’s 4 time winner of best ski resort in Japan, Rusutsu Resort.\n\nThe success of this proposal will set precedent for this type of activation to be scaled globally and harness the potential for a deeper relationship within Rusutsu Resort’s network, allowing us to integrate Nouns branding further.\n\n## Thanks for your time and consideration!\nAs a token of our appreciation, here's a nounish, Japanese, alpine themed open edition, free mint, NFT made using Nouns AI and Noun Sounds.\n[![Minterface](https://i.imgur.com/U8WsSlf.png)\n](https://create.zora.co/collections/0x1465099a346cf17f717b633bd899d14cf6f694e1)"},{"blockNumber":16521559,"blockHash":"0x4e261ac44a2e15827ccfde1486b79f24ef8432f49fd80128a84185ed972eec79","transactionIndex":44,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x3d7cbc4e52ff9157166c6a6c0b1aa201f79034012013ed977c4090e40d2b7d89","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":219,"proposer":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","targets":["0x640A55F99D99a8CC47b8A422c78Bb96712b7F52B"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":16557559,"endBlock":16593559,"description":"# Proliferate – Measure – Repeat\n\n## TL;DR\n- We propose a Prop House round where builders will submit a proposal that includes their own unique metric for measuring Nounish impact.\n- The proposed round is different from Open Rounds as it asks builders to bring their own proposal, embed their own metrics, argue its importance and overall impact of their proposal all in one submission.\n- Lil Data Pod will provide post-event analysis and findings to identify the most effective data driven approaches from builders, which can lead to better Prop House rounds in the future.\n- The goal is to help discover the many nuances in the kind of metrics used in measuring proliferation by giving builders freedom to add their own metrics and argue its usefulness within the scope of their proposal, enabling voters to gauge impact before voting.\n\n## Rationale\nThere is impact, then there is Nounish Impact.\nMeasuring proliferation has been discussed for quite sometime. From builders’ perspective, we observe measuring proliferation using established methods is difficult potentially caused by the elusive quality of subjective, qualitative impact of proliferation efforts. Giving builders the autonomy to pick their own metrics for measuring their proliferation efforts, and encouraging them to argue its importance in measuring overall Nounish impact of what they do will give voters, participants, as well as builders a glimpse into possibilities in measuring Nounish Impact.\nWe propose a Prop House round where builders will be asked to submit a proposal that includes their own unique metric for measuring Nounish impact.\n\n## How is it different from Open Rounds?\nOpen Rounds asks proposers to write and submit proposals. This gives way for voters to make decisions based on *perceived* impact, not *******measured/measurable******* impact. \n\nThe proposed round asks builders to include their own metrics in their proposals, argue its importance, and the overall impact of their proposal — all in one submission.

While the treasury has been well capitalized thus far, we’ve seen the Nouns auctions drop from an average price of ~80Ξ → ~30Ξ. At the same time proposals have been increasing in scope and complexity, requiring more funding.\n\nFor the DAO to continue operations at its current scope and with its current vision, **we need to start putting more emphasis on treasury growth and self-sustainability.**\n\n\n\nThe recent stETH ([#217](https://nouns.wtf/vote/217)) proposal was well received by Nouns members, a great indicator that a majority of the members are interested in safely increasing the DAO’s available capital.\n\nAs of today, NounsDAO has ~5-10% of the treasury in Lido and it’s yielding ~18Ξ per month or 215Ξ annually (equivalent to ~7 auctions). This is a great first step to increasing the treasury without assuming too much risk onto the DAO, as Lido is one of the most trusted staking providers, managing billions of ETH.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9ov5I1Q.png)\n\nThe next logical step is to productionize the stETH in the treasury as well. We plan to do that by creating the **Nouns Treasury Management**.\n\n## The Team\n\nThis proposal is brought to you by 0xPiney.eth, ramenboy.eth, and pinkglasses.eth. Collectivey, we’re known as 1560 Studios. The sum of three Nouners united to produce Nounish infrastructure that will maximize DAO efficiency and potential.\n\n- Noun 575 (0xpiney.eth) - All things on-chain and smart contracts\n- Noun 576 (ramenboy.eth) - All things web + design\n- Noun 409 (pinkglasses.eth) - All things DeFi and Decentralized.\n\nWe are industry veterans who have worked in big tech and exchanges before diving into the web3 ecosystem exploring NFTs, DeFi, and DAO’s. Since the start of the year, we’ve been working full-time to create all things Nounish and decentralized.\n\n\n## **Nouns Treasury Management (NTM)**\n\nNTM is a bespoke solution for NounsDAO that will manage a portion of the treasury and be completely governed by NounsDAO - a decentralized asset manager.\n\nStrategies can be created by absolutely anyone. Our aim is to create truly decentralized asset management infrastructure that can be used by anyone and everyone, with the approval from governance. We’d like to kick off NTM with a pilot program that’ll serve as a foundation for future yielding strategies.\n\n\nFor the pilot program, we want to focus on creating yield from the current stETH sitting in the treasury. We want to focus on stETH for 2 main reasons:\n\n1. **stETH is not used for proposal funding, and ETH withdrawals have yet to be unlocked.** Even after Shanghai is merged, there will be withdrawal queues in order to convert the stETH to ETH. The DAO’s stETH will be ‘sitting’ in the treasury for the foreseeable future. This creates an opportunity for us to yield in the meantime.\n2. **The most battle tested protocols with huge TVL’s support stETH.** This allows us to generate yield using relatively low risk strategies.\n\nNTM is inspired by Yearn vaults which currently hold over $400M in AUM (and peaked at around $6B AUM). These contracts are extremely battle tested and a reference in the yield aggregator domain. NTM’s general architecture will look like this:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nyYNq3M.png)\n\n**The key contracts + terms:**\n\n*Preface: For security reasons, all contracts will be **audited** and non-upgradeable. No proxies anywhere.*\n\n`Vault`: A contract that stores 1 asset (ETH, stETH, USDC, etc). Vaults manage the assets by deploying them into various yield bearing strategies. All vaults will:\n\n- be ERC4626 compatible\n- have privileged access to NounsDAO\n- be withdrawable by NounsDAO at any point (pending governance vote).\n\n`Strategy`: A contract that implements a yield bearing strategy - eg. take stETH and LP it into Curve, and sell the Curve emissions daily into ETH. Vaults deposit assets into specific strategies; ergo, the DAO sets the desired strategies employed.\n\n`NounsVaultManager`: The NounsVaultManager creates vaults and manages the strategies and assets used within the vaults. The DAO will interact with the Vault Manager through the TransactionBuilder.  All these vaults are ERC4626 compliant and deposit/withdrawals will only be able to be accessed by the DAO (TransactionBuilder).\n\n`NounsStrategyFactory`: The factory that creates different strategies for assets.\n\n## Yield **Strategies for the Pilot Program**\n\nNTM is first and foremost a **platform** that is completely governed by the DAO. Any Nouns members is able to create a strategy for any existing vault and the DAO can vote to accept the strategy or not - a completely democratic and Nounish treasury manager.\n\nFor the pilot program, we have researched a few strategies taking into account yield + risk for the treasury. While there are a wide range of possible strategies that take into account different models for analyzing risk/reward, we see these first two strategies as being ideal for the pilot program of NTM.\n\n1. **LP stETH <> ETH into Curve.** Today, 90%+ of stETH <> ETH swaps go through Curve. By LP’ing into Curve, we’d get returns from supplying this market.\n    - **Yield:** Low to Medium (~2.5% APY currently with $LDO emissions). ~125ETH ($200K USD) yield in 1 year with our stETH in treasury.\n    - **Risk:** Low.\n        - There exists two main risks with this strategy:\n            1. stETH depegs. We’ve seen stETH deviate away from ETH so this is a potential risk the DAO would assume. stETH and ETH are expected to trade closer to - if not exactly 1:1 once Shanghai is deployed, since stETH will be directly redeemable. \n            2. Curve gets exploited. We see a minimal risk of this due to the time these contracts have been deployed on-chain, and the audits performed on them.\n\n    If the peg diverges by a significant amount, we may see a different amount of stETH to ETH in our LP position. Past attempts from external actors to destabilize stETH in the past resulted in the peg converging to a 1:1 ratio regardless, with interesting returns for the LP’s.\n\n    When exiting or entering said strategy we would pledge both assets in order to minimize negative slippage (pledging ETH <-> stETH instead of just stETH).\n\n    **Strategy #1 Summary:** Interest generated by this strategy could (at current APY) help fund the cost of grants at a rate of 10 ETH/month, while exposing the DAO to minimal risk by using a trusted protocol with already $5B in TVL.\n        \n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/RwkzZm0.png)\n        \n2. **LP stETH <> ETH into Balancer and stake into Aura Finance.** Balancer is a popular DEX and Aura Finance is similar to what Convex is to Curve (governance and emissions from Balancer).\n    - **Yield:** High (~8-10% APY currently with $AURA and $BAL emissions). 400 ETH (600K USD) in 1 year.\n    - **Risk:** Low\n        - There are three main risks associated with this strategy:\n            1. stETH depegs. See above.\n            2. Balancer gets exploited: Same reason as Curve above - battle tested DEX + has been operating with hundreds of millions in TVL. \n            - Aura gets exploited: Aura has had extensive audits done to its contracts, works closely with Balancer, does continuous code reviews, and holds $450M+ in TVL.\n        \n    Similar to Strategy #2, we’d be earning additional yield by depositing into a second order protocol. Based on the amount in TVL and the similarity of the smart contracts with Convex, the risk profile is very similar.\n        \n    We would, however, need to sell (harvest) 3 separate tokens. This would potentially increases the gas costs of this strategy, but the rewards being ~3x the Curve strategy would cover any increase in transaction fees.\n        \n    **Strategy #2 Summary:** With this strategy we could generate 32 ETH per month. This would be enough to fund the Nouns Prop House in its current form without any drains on the treasury.\n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/UBWLngv.png)\n        \n## Timeline + Ask\n\nWe believe implementing these two strategies will be the most fruitful for the pilot program based on risk <> reward. We estimate it will take ~1 month for the implementation of NTM, auditing of contracts, and implementing the new treasury page.\n\nWe are asking for **65ETH** from NounsDAO to implement the above, with an additional **100 ETH + 100 stETH** that would be used to pilot this project (with future expectations to allocate more capital to NTM if the results are favorable). These pilot funds will first be sent to a multi-sig with trusted Nouns members (see below), until the NTM contracts have been audited and deployed.\n\nThe funds will go towards:\n\n- **Contract audit** (30 ETH for C4 audit).\n- ~11 ETH each (3 members) to get this version of NTM into production (implementation + audits) + treasury page. We estimate this will take ~1 month.\n\nFollowing the launch of the pilot program, we’d be requesting:\n\n- 50% of all yields (**no principal**) will go to 1560 studios until we hit **175 ETH.**\n- After we hit 175 ETH, we would take a 2% management fee on further generated yield (no principal).\n\nTo emphasize, we want to profit alongside the DAO, in order to properly align incentives. Rather than making a large ask and risk t, we’d prefer to win if our output is legitimate and positive-sum.\n\nWe’re excited about the idea of working on this, and we hope to deliver a treasury that’s more capital efficient and less dependent on primary sales for funding. **This proposal is the first step in NounsDAO becoming 100% fully self-sustaining.**\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\n1. If the pilot program proves to be profitable and well-received, we will submit another proposal to allocate more stETh to NTM for the current strategies.\n\n2. The team will continue maintaining NTM and researching new strategies alongside Nouners.\n    - We will be actively taking feedback and working with any Nouners that are interested in developing strategies.\n    - A low hanging fruit could be to create a strategy to productionize our lil nouns by LPing them into Sudoswap.\n    - Design and UX is a huge focus for us so we will be constantly improving NTM and the treasury page.\n\n3. Following the initial development of NTM, we want to generalize it as a service (we've acquired [ntm.wtf](http://ntm.wtf) as the domain) for every on-chain treasury. We're going to be actively listening to feedback and speaking with Nouns members about how to build this in a way that properly benefits Nouners and the DAO itself. \n    - Prophouse like plug and play service for other treasuries to generate yield using NTM.\n    - Potential kickbacks back to the DAO for every new DAO integration.\n    - Push NTM to be premier on-chain treasury management service for all DAOs.\n    - To foster conversations about self sustainability, we will be sharing frequent updates of new developments and ideas. \n\n4.

Our mission is huge: fix Nouns Governance and empower its contributors.\n\nWe saw tremendous success in our basic MVP from October through December:\n- Discussion on House of Nouns that exists nowhere else\n- Usage (MAUs and pageviews) grew >100% month-over-month \n- Continual expressions of love and support from the community\n- A go-to client that streamlines governance and prop discussion\n\n![HON v1](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/HON+v1.png)\n![Prop Debate](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Prop+Debate.png)\n[(a debate on Proposal 202)](https://houseofnouns.wtf/proposals/202)\n\n# Deliverables\nOur MVP was just a small part of the vision for House of Nouns: a full suite of supercharged governance tools, for all Nounish DAOs, built on open source infrastructure that anyone can extend.\n\nHere are the key components we’ll build into House of Nouns v2.\n\n**Pre-proposal client.** Discourse is starved of life, and HON v2 will streamline everything that happens before a proposal goes on-chain, saving energy and empowering contributors to do their best work.\n- Rich discussion layer for getting feedback on a draft \n- Inline commenting on specific parts of a draft\n- Templates and multiplayer editor for creating proposal drafts\n- Ability to revise and re-release versions of a draft (like ProductHunt, or this House of Nouns prop) \n- Imported data from Discourse for backwards compatibility\n- One click to promote to on-chain, or have a sponsor do it for you \n- *(Note: see demo at top of prop)*\n\n**Ideas client.** Aligning the DAO on what matters is essential; we want to help contributors know what the DAO is excited about.\n- Reddit-like platform for generating, voting on, and rewarding ideas at the earliest stage\n- Backwards compatibility and integration with Prop Lot API\n- *(Note: see demo at top of prop)* \n\n**Open-source infrastructure** to enable the next 100 governance clients. HON v2 will eliminate all barriers to building on Nouns governance, and improve decentralization. We don’t want to be the last great governance client; we want to be the first of many.\n- API for all governance data, discussion data, Nouner profiles, and more\n- SDK for easy integration of client components to other platforms\n- Frontend repository for House of Nouns website\n- Technical documentation to help new Nounish builders launch their governance apps\n\n**Public good for all Nounish DAOs.** The success of Nouns is directly correlated to the success of Nounish forks; HON v2 will proliferate Nounish governance and drive value back to Nouns through forks (beyond ones created through Nouns Builder, like Lil Nouns, SharkDAO, etc) and branding ⌐◨-◨.\n- See activity from all of your Nounish DAOs in one feed\n- Keep track of all urgent to-dos and notifications across DAOs\n- Full House of Nouns functionality for all future forks of Nouns\n- *(Note: We’ve already been funded by Nouns Builder to support their DAOs. Extending to non-Nouns Builder forks is a minimal effort on our side, and neither of these integrations contribute heavily to this prop’s budget. However, we wanted to ensure that we committed to it explicitly here, because we do see it as an important public good to support a future ecosystem of diverse forks.)*\n\n**First-class integration with other Nounish tools.** HON v2 will be your single looking glass into the rabbit hole of Nounish governance.\n- Agora delegate profile data\n- heyanoun anonymous commenting\n- Federation DAO-to-DAO governance\n- Nouns Atlas search \n\n**New & improved core governance tooling.** You asked and we heard — we’ll be delivering a faster and improved experience on core proposal tooling. This includes an improved UI, much faster loading, notifications for new proposals, enhanced profiles, and other improvements.\n\n**Moving beyond.** We move quickly. While we don’t want to overpromise, we’re also excited to go above-and-beyond with **social media data indexing, contributor profiles, and a post-proposal client** once we ship our core objectives. These will provide richer context and data, more functionality for DAO alignment, and greater transparency for the community.\n\nMost of all, we want to make governance fun and easy instead of a chore.\n\n# Budget, team, and sustainability\nWe’re requesting **190 ETH for 5 months** for full-time development work from the team. After revising our proposal, we believe this is in line with standard service development costs seen in coming out to 9.5 ETH/developer/month.\n\nThis will be spearheaded by:\n- [dadkins](https://twitter.com/dadkins_): longtime crypto hacker\n- [Wojciech Kocjan](https://twitter.com/w_kocjan): frontend & design engineer\n- Jamal Hashim: ex-Amazon, blockchain engineer\n- John Cairns: longtime crypto builder, ex-Gemini\n\nFor the sake of transparency, House of Nouns is by Collective, which is a VC-backed company that has expertise in NFTs and community tooling (previously launched MomentRanks.com and grew community tooling to 50,000+ Flow blockchain users). That being said, we want to make sure this is a self-sustaining and fair investment for the DAO; as such, the end goals include open source infrastructure and self-sustainability for the product, and the budget reflects what we think is a fair pricing for development services.\n\nWe plan to offer bespoke upgrades to other DAOs similar to Red Hat’s monetization model, as well as charging hosting costs for larger communities.\n\nThese upgrades will be built into the broader platform and framework for all users. To reiterate, **Nouns will have permanent access to the product open-source base infrastructure from this proposal, and future upgrades for other DAOs will improve upon this base layer, meaning Nouns receives HON v2 and reaps the benefits of future compatible upgrades.**\n\n# Testimonies\n![Testimony 1](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/testimony1.png) \n![Testimony 2](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/testimony2.png)\n![Testimony 3](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/testimony3.png)\n…and many more <3 "},{"blockNumber":16537906,"blockHash":"0x4ac8c38761180551e72377d2653d6b68890ffbdc26fab5b63ab9a4f2f11cc9de","transactionIndex":270,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x0da8f320e813effb1051653d7ba2f0ee067d7343c4768af906a4337a9e0572ee","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":224,"proposer":"0x60BF178a865D733e9A40C5f8e9F5D5aA6E84498a","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)",""],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000003136d4116752b7d65c21760b9aab8f57a441b07000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000022ecb25c00","0x"],"startBlock":16573906,"endBlock":16609906,"description":"# Nouns x Artmatr\n\nTL;DR\n=====\n\nWe are [Artmatr](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://artmatr.io&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650901360&usg=AOvVaw07IzQx3i2iMHXswoHXMwD6), an art and technology playground for interdisciplinary creatives to compose unique artworks unlike anything else available today.

For reference, the latest Artmatr-fabricated artwork (for a digital-native artist) sold for more than $250K.\n\nWe hope to leverage this experience to explore future collaborations, including fabricating existing Nouns.\n\n[](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vimeo.com/792337208&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650904656&usg=AOvVaw0vOizFKZbzuEhMIqLR8lcK) \n\n* * *\n\nTHE PROCESS\n===========\n\nOur goal is to create beautiful artworks that will proudly represent Nouns in the real world.\n\n[Nouns](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/nouns-57a91c516c94494984d28039b16f4106?utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=share-popup&utm_content=57a91c516c94494984d28039b16f4106) by [omegadarling](https://sketchfab.com/omegadarling?utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=share-popup&utm_content=57a91c516c94494984d28039b16f4106) on [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com?utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=share-popup&utm_content=57a91c516c94494984d28039b16f4106)\n\n [](#cmnt1)\n\n1.

Artmatr will fabricate 7 unique Nouns per the specifications over a 7-day period, fabricating one Noun each day.\n4.  Artmatr will livestream the fabrication process on Twitch and YouTube.\n5.  Throughout  the creative process, Artmatr will document a short film  highlighting the transition from digital to physical\n6.  Once fabrication is complete, Artmatr will hold an exhibition to display the artworks, exhibiting the digital Nouns side-by-side with the physical pieces.\n7.  Artmatr will collaborate with the Nouns community to generate buzz and bring the community together with the traditional art community.\n8.  Explore future options to enable Nouns community to fabricate physical art.\n\n* * *\n\nABOUT ARTMATR\n=============\n\nArtmatr’s journey began almost eight years ago, by our founder Ben Tritt, an artist who has spent his entire career searching for ways to integrate his love of painting with the digital world. Way before NFTs, Ben visualized a world where painting and digital tools went hand in hand to create unique pieces of art. His journey took him to MIT, where he started exploring different methods of translating digital art into physical pieces through robotics.![](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/3919/s32WMc.jpg)\n\nEventually, these experiments led to several technological products, most notably sophisticated painting robots that can create unprecedented art across different mediums - oil painting, watercolors, airbrush as well as new approaches to digital printing. These capabilities lend themselves to an incredibly flexible fabrication platform that can both mimic artists’ hands through brushstrokes, and create entirely new methods of painting, such as taking code and directly translating it into prints. The fabrication process is intensely creative, given the flexibility of the tools; one piece of art can take on many different forms through the choice of different mediums and variables within the mediums themselves.\n\nArtmatr has already worked with some of the world’s most influential artists, running the gamut of traditional artists such as [Jeff Koons](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.jeffkoons.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650908671&usg=AOvVaw2teZ565IDJwwpvUyTTFr6o), to newer digital artists like Beeple and Tyler Hobbs.\n\nOur vision is to allow digital artists and collectors to translate their works into beautiful, one-of-a-kind pieces of art that could be proudly displayed in any gallery. We are currently hard at work developing a software suite that will complement the hardware platform, and are partnering with leading manufacturers with the shared goal of democratizing the creation and sale of physical art.![](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/8170/8g0VQz.jpg)\n\nThe Artmatr Team:\n\nArtmatr was founded by Benjamin Tritt, the company's Chief Creative officer, who has been creating and teaching art for decades at places like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Musee D'Orsay in Paris, The National Gallery in London, and MIT, and has seen it as his life’s mission to seek ways to unite technology & art. Rafael Feitelberg, Artmatr’s CEO, served as an executive at Tech Fortune 500 companies and has a proven track record of building, scaling and selling startups in Silicon Valley. Rafael has had a lifelong passion for art and holds a B.A. in Art History.\n\nTogether, they have built a diverse team of engineers, business professionals, and artists, who share their vision for creating the industry standard for bridging between digital and physical art.\n\nArtmatr’s Investors:\n\n*   [Delphi Digital](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://delphidigital.io&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650910270&usg=AOvVaw3rt_SvbDLMzIq6fzpmzVuQ): Delphi Digital is the leading research organization for crypto assets. Their research is regarded as an industry standard by institutions and crypto-natives alike. Delphi’s Ventures arm invests in early-stage Web3 startups, protocols, and networks that strive to make crypto happen sooner. Additionally, Delphi Labs incubates and builds protocols and tooling for the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n“We are incredibly excited for the world to see the power of Artmatr’s automated fabrication technology. Artmatr unlocks a new medium for a generation of digitally native artists to express themselves in the physical realm. We believe there is no better collaboration than with Nouns DAO given their commitment to advancing crypto, art and technology.”\n\n*   [Metaversal Ventures](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.metaversal.gg/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650910954&usg=AOvVaw1fxq3HSoosWRt1xTdPZyBR): Metaversal is a holding company focused on the NFT vertical spanning all stages of the market from large corporate brands to individual NFT artists. We deploy a differentiated strategy by investing in the next blue chip NFT assets, supporting NFT infrastructure build out, and acting as an incubator and venture studio to NFT creators. Metaversal partners with brands, creators, content holders, and IP owners to identify, execute, and underwrite evocative NFT projects. Backed by CoinFund, DCG, Galaxy and other leading investors, the Metaversal team is uniquely positioned to identify the requirements for success in the web3 ecosystem and remains platform and blockchain agnostic.\n\n* * *\n\nWHY THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN\n\n*   Spreading the Word: We believe this collaboration will help spread Nouns through a first of its kind event, bringing together thought leaders from the art world and web3 to celebrate a future where DAOs bring the digital and physical world together\n*   Increase Market Size: Our belief is that by providing a bridge between digital and physical art we can effectively increase the size of both markets. NFT owners will now be able to proudly display the art they own, while physical pieces can be brought on-chain and receive a stronger validation of their provenance\n*   Increase Nouns Prices: By pairing Nouns with beautiful physical pieces, we believe the sales price for each Noun will increase over the period of fabrication. In the past, taking digital pieces into the real world has resulted in 3-10X increase in value for the artists\n*   Leadership: By being the first DAO to bring its assets to the physical world as real art, Nouns will establish itself as leading the charge in showcasing the flexibility of the NFT model and its many applications besides digital-only art\n*   Community-Building: Nouners will be able to to get together and celebrate the community, build relationships, increase the network effects of the DAO, and potentially bringing in new Nouners into the fold\n\n* * *\n\nGOALS OF THIS PROPOSAL\n\nThe following are our goals for this proposal, should it pass:\n\n*   The production of a physical event, exhibiting Nouns art IRL, drawing interest from the local art scene as well as digital enthusiasts and media coverage.\n*   Work with the Nouns community to promote and market this collaboration and ultimately increase sales prices of Nouns\n\n* * *\n\nTIMELINES\n\n*   February 6-March 18, 2023 - Marketing efforts begin, including press releases and videos on social media\n*   March 20, 2023 - Fabrication begins, livestream starts\n\n1.

Already in conversations with iconic musicians and reputable foundations- we will make a major ripple in the lives of musicians, music fans, music education and overall- **Nounish proliferation.** \n\nOver a 6 month period, our goal is to onboard and empower musicians, build upon the existing Noun Sounds platform, create a DAO structure and develop new systems for **musicians and music lovers to create, share and participate in Noun Sounds**- building a self-sustaining community around all things music.\n\n## **Total: 245.5 ETH**\n\n*(See bottom of proposal for funding breakdown)*\n\n## Proposal Outline\n\nFrom January-June 2023, Noun Sounds Pod will:\n\n→  **Empower + Onboard Musicians** \n\n→  **Further Develop Nouns Sounds Platform** \n\n→  **Nounish Partnerships** \n\n→ **Create Noun Sounds DAO**\n\n## Empowering + Onboarding Musicians\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DvdegTr.jpg)\n\nOne of our top initiatives is to empower musicians through funding and community building.  Our initial conversations include: \n\n- **Large-scale Artist 61ETH**\n    - **Ghostface Killah from Wu-Tang Clan:** *in discussions about making a CC0 song and sound pack for Noun Sounds + a photoshoot with the Noggles glasses.  Ghost has millions of fans and he digs the Noggles.*\n    \n        - *If the collaboration with Ghostface Killah does not happen, the full 61ETH will be sent back to NounsDAO*\n\n- **Indie-artist 23ETH**\n    - **Lisa Caruso:** *A talented indie artist from Australia, Lisa has had her music featured on major network TV shows and has released a slew of cool music and visuals.  Our plan is to create a Nounish E.P. and sound pack with her + a mini-doc following her creative process.*\n- **Prop House x Noun Sounds 19.5ETH**\n    \n    We will be leveraging Prop House rounds for musicians to onboard new talent for songs, sounds, music videos and more.  One Prop House round every month for 6 months:\n    \n    - **2ETH x 5** - *Musicians will submit their music catalog and NS voters will choose (5) artists to make a new Nounish CC0 song/beat.*\n    - **1ETH x 5** - *Musicians will submit their music catalog and be hired to create a CC0 sample pack containing loops and samples.*\n    - **.5ETH x 4** - *Creators can make a video for Save The Music with the purpose of amassing educational content for students (i.e. “How To Play The Guitar 101”).*\n    - **.25ETH x 10** - *Anyone can submit their audio catalog and NS holders will vote for artists to create new CC0 sound effects and real-world sounds (i.e. recording the ocean or other foley sounds)*\n\n## Further Develop Nouns Sounds Platform\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VmKPbpi.png)\n\nPart of our MVP was building out the PLAYground section of the Noun Sounds website.  Building upon this, we will be creating new tools and features within the NS platform as we grow our pod:\n\n- **Mint Playlists: The Nouns Player**\n    - Meet the **Nouns Player companion**: A free *“Winamp”-style audio player that will be able to pull music from Spotify, read from the playlists and allow you to enjoy each **curation**.*\n    - Creators will be able to mint playlists of songs and podcasts from their catalogues. Taste-Makers and Curators will be able capture a moment in time and create communities around each of them.\n    - This not only allows artists to create but also empowers one of the most important thing in music: **curation**.\n    - *Each Nouns Player will have the option of creating custom skins for their companion.* Thus, the Playlist Creator will come along with an **Album Art and “Skins” creator tool** for the music player.\n    - These playlists will allow creators and curators to offer token gated content (on their websites or through channels in their discords) based on each of their mintable playlists.\n- **Artist Profiles**\n    - *Artists and creators* will be able to setup their own custom page to showoff their catalogue and give updates. You’ll be able to read about their work, see what packs they’re just released, or check out what playlists are currently minting.\n- **Profesional** **Music Creator Tools**\n    - **VST Instruments:** *Offering tools to experienced musicians*, we will be creating professional instruments that can be used in music-making programs. From keyboards, vocals, synths, drums and more- music makers can download, install and get to making their own Noun Sounds within their existing audio workstation.\n    - **Soundboard:** A fully functional CC0 soundboard on Noun Sounds for use across all Twitter Spaces and more. One of our most requested features.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2og8Ys1.png)\n\n\n\n## Nounish Partnerships\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PH0pU8p.png)\n\nPartnering with **[Save The Music](https://www.savethemusic.org/)**, we will proliferate the good vibes via IRL impacts and educational experiences. Save The Music partners with school districts and local communities to build sustainable music programs. Noun Sounds will start by running a Prop House with STM and include the partnership in future DAO proposals, while assisting them in the web3 landscape. \n\n\n## Noun Sounds DAO\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lyE5x23.png)\n\nUsing the Nouns Builder, Noun Sounds will create a daily auction to onboard new users into the Noun Sounds ecosystem.  Holding a Noun Sounds NFT allows you to put proposals on chain, vote on proposals and have an overall voice in the direction of the Noun Sounds treasury and growth.\n\n## Costs Breakdown\n\n**103.5ETH -** Onboarding world-renowned and indie musicians via collaborations and Prop House rounds.\n\n**67ETH -** SuperTightWoody- DAO partnerships, operations, music/content production, music communications and community management.\n\n**67ETH -** Papaya - Platform upgrades, CC0 music onboarding flow, mintable “Winamp”-style Nouns Player tools: playlist maker via Spotify API and custom player “Skins” art

to continue doing Nounish Twitter Spaces every single day, plus to expand our reach into other mediums and socials, while acting as an onboarding and community hub for Nouns.** \n \n**We have *crushed* all of our metric goals, 4X-ing our Twitter impressions and daily listens, going viral on TikTok with 8MM+ views, and becoming one of the go-to Nouns DAO onboarding sources for artists, builders, and new Nouners alike. We even managed to squeeze an extra month of operations out of our budget by creating a game ([NOMO Nouns](https://nomo.wtf)) that has generated 7 ETH for the show during its beta release alone.** \n\n**Our proposed budget for the next 6 months of continued media growth and Community-As-A-Service to the DAO is 319 ETH (53 per month, including funds ear-marked for art contests and community project grants.) However, we are committing to self-raising 50 ETH of revenue through several crypto-native and media-native strategies.** \n \n**Therefore, our ask of the DAO today is *269 ETH.*  Please read on to

avenue.*\n\n# Proposal Summary \n\nIn [Proposal 128](https://nouns.wtf/vote/128), we set out to turn The Noun Square into \"*a daily touchpoint for the community and a powerful onboarding tool for Nouns.\"* This prop was structured to cover art contest prizes, operations and team compensation for 5 months, ending Dec 31/2022. \n\n**During that time, our team has met and surpassed ALL of the broad goals and specific metrics that we set out for ourselves in that proposal, and we've even stretched our operations an additional bonus month with careful budgeting and some supplemental internal revenue generation.**\n\n## **In the past 6 months we have:**\n\n✅  **accumulated over 36K followers across TNS socials**\n✅  **went viral on

(Sufficiently Decentralized) Media Company:\n\n\n\nThe TNS Team is very proud to have produced an engaging and well-attended [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) Spaces Show called Noun O' Clock LIVE **every single day** since June 13, 2022. \n\n## **That's 230+ days in a row!**\n\nWe have hosted many marquee guests during this time such as [Mike Demarais](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1gqxvyAqvrQJB), [Alana and Jesse from Variant Fund](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1ypKddjZmwvKW), [Farokh and Mando of RugRadio](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1577067235729809408?s=20&t=zQCPpXVy26grCNGAnw0wng), [Punk 4156](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1rmxPkdNgbQJN), [VapeApe](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1570196265165803520?s=20&t=wZOZmKpgq9TfmVNR8LgwgA), and [Ryan Carson](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1600721492718649345?s=20&t=orcqkvWL1S150I6hm-oBzQ)... plus many brand new Nouners, and countless interesting nounish builders and artists.\n\nOver the past 6 months, we have accumulated nearly **57K total [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) listens to our spaces,** hosting a total of **580 unique spaces**, including our flagship daily NOC LIVE and a slate of weekly community spaces through a new program called **The SoapBox.**\n\n\n[![twitter-listens-graphic.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/sxtJ87K3/twitter-listens-graphic.gif)](https://postimg.cc/vxt9x1pK)\n*Twitter Spaces Metrics: Up and to the Right*\n\n## What is The Noun Square SoapBox?\n\nThe SoapBox Network was developed by TNS as a way to leverage our platform to provide Nounish communities with a voice, as well as opportunities to cross-pollinate and collaborate with other groups in the ecosystem.\n\n*If The Noun Square is meant to depict an old town plaza with a clocktower in the centre, **The SoapBox** imagery might evoke passionate nounish subcommunities such as [Lil Nouns](https://lilnouns.wtf), [Food Nouns](https://foodnouns.wtf) and [Gnars](https://gnars.wtf) dragging a soapbox into the Square to stand atop and give a rousing speech to their own community of nounsfolk.*\n\nStepping back out of the realm of metaphor, SoapBox is, simply put, a Network that allows any community in the orbit of Nouns to host weekly Twitter Spaces on [The Noun Square Twitter account](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) (usually co-hosted from their own account), allowing them to bootstrap an audience that is comprised of a mix of their own fans, TNS's unique community, and spillover audiences from other SoapBoxes as well. \n\n[![gami-quote-prop-correct.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/kg2nQDSm/gami-quote-prop-correct.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/68NJwWzj)\n\n[![brennen-testimonial.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/MH6XJkdY/brennen-testimonial.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/gX7G379w)\n*Nouners Gami and Brennen (of Gnars and Nouns Esports respectively) on their experience with SoapBox*\n\n\nAt present, we are hosting approximately **38 Twitter interesting and well-attended spaces per week**, including our daily  Noun O' Clock spaces and the various TNS Soapboxes. \n\n# Twitter Engagement \n\nIn addition to our healthy Twitter Spaces metrics, TNS also has a robust track record of increasing both unique impressions and 100% organic engagement on Twitter, from a combination of art contests and games, as well as cross-posting quality nounish content from other accounts and communities too. \n\n[![twitter-engagement-chart.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/2SWdK01J/twitter-engagement-chart.gif)](https://postimg.cc/Yvpm4fff)\n*Impress-ive Numbers*\n\nAt the time of our previous Proposal, we had achieved 1.2MM impressions across all our posts, and the baseline trend through to present would have carried us to about 3MM impressions. \n\n**In reality, our impression growth has been exponential, with a 5X increase to over 5.4MM in a 5 month period.** (See chart above.) \n\nSimilarly, our Profile Visits were up **4.6X to 446K**, and we completely blew through our previous Proposal goal of 5000 followers, as we are trending towards **close to 6000 Twitter followers as of this proposal.** \n\nHere is a screenshot from Prop 128 showing our year-end goals for Twitter followers and daily Spaces Listens, both of which we have exceeded (6000 vs. 5000 and 380+ vs. 200 respectively):\n\n[![follower-goal.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XvGwCQbx/follower-goal.png)](https://postimg.cc/1gSnx04N)\n\n# Other Media Channels\n\nAlthough the focus of Prop 128 was growing our Twitter Spaces reach and onboarding artists and creators to Nouns, part of our vision for this time was also to begin experimenting with content for other platforms such as YouTube and TikTok, to complement our Twitter content strategy. We have had some success with both of these platforms during this trial, especially on TikTok (where we went viral in December and continue to get great numbers.)\n\n## TikTok\n\n[NounFungibleNikki](https://twitter.com/web3nikki) and [Hypnos](https://twitter.com/hypnoseffect) had been working as a team on a Nounish [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquare) presence for the NounsNews Project, before that project was discontinued in the fall.\n\nSeeing their impressive efforts and consistency, TNS approached and asked them to join forces and **merge our TikTok accounts together under the TNS banner.** *(Was this the first Nounish Acquisition in history? Maybe not explicitly, but it was nonetheless the beginning of an amazing collaborative relationship that has produced some of our most popular and viral nounish content over the past months.)*\n\nShortly after bringing Nikki and Hypnos into the TNS team, we also saw that [JP](https://twitter.com/eusou_jp) had been getting some really impressive attention on TikToks he had created for a Brazilian Noggle sticker campaign [\"Encontre o adesivo.\"](https://www.tiktok.com/@encontreoadesivo?_t=8ZOeB0NEt9x&_r=1) We invited him to join the team, both to run a Portuguese Language TNS TikTok Account, and to advise Nikki and Hypnos on English language TT content strategy as well.\n\n**Under the guidance of this new team, the growth of our TikTok presence has been nothing short of incredible; from a baseline of 37,000 views in September, to a steady ~100K in October and November, and then spiking dramatically to over 8 million views in the month of December:**\n\n[![tiktok-metrics-prop.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/RVh8YxQ0/tiktok-metrics-prop.gif)](https://postimg.cc/xcrtk7Zr)\n*Exponential TikTok Audience growth.*\n\nA clever video collaboration between JP on the [TNS Brazil account](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkge7F/) and N/H on the [main TNS account](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLk4k7G/) managed to go viral twice, one version on each account. After this video (a lighthearted curiosity-hook about nounish tattoos), many of our other videos, including trend videos, interviews and educational shorts, began to accumulate views and organic engagement as well. \n\nFor example, check out this TikTok re-packaging of an [@Nounish video](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkvGGQ/) (with their permission) with **nearly 30K views.** Or this video of Nikki interviewing a [Nouns Vision-wearing Farokh at Art Basel](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkvGGQ/), with **almost 80K views.** Or this [followup to the tattoo video](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkgxjT/) where Nikki explains what Noggles and Nouns are, which has just under **70 thousand views** so far as well. \n\n[![tiktok-thumbnails.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/rFKPygFN/tiktok-thumbnails.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/qzHLjsKN)\n\nWe also ran a very successful Public Good contest on TikTok called **#NounsGiveBack**, calling on our viewers and community to **do something good** in their local community and submit a video showing what they'd done. We had participants from all over the world who submitted some really inspiring entries. \n\nThe hashtag #NounsGiveBack on TT has received **over 300K views** across our own posts and all of the entries to date. A 2-minute recap video summarizing many of the amazing submissions has received **over 32.5K views** as well, [you can watch it here.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkb4JM/) We are planning to launch a second Public Good contest as well in the coming weeks using the same hashtag. \n\nAt present, both TNS TikTok accounts have amassed over 30,000 combined unique followers, over 850K \"Likes\" across our videos, and nearly 8.5MM total views on all videos. For more metrics, our TikTok team has prepared a short deck that provides some additional details and insights [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d_ezmaSVbTC345t0W33Py_PmIXrVdXrTO9xnxPYalIY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**This is a huge opportunity to proliferate Nouns, especially to a younger generation of artists and builders, and we are excited to see what the TNS TikTok Dream Team can achieve over the next 6 months with a renewed mandate and continued enthusiasm.**\n\n## YouTube\n\nWe have also begun some experimentation on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@thenounsquare) in 3 main ways during this proposal period: \n1) Streaming all notable Twitter Spaces to YT Live for alternate tune-in and listen-back options; \n2) Creating and hosting evergreen/educational nounish video content; and \n3) Hosting/re-hosting of co-branded video content from other nounish projects such as House of Nouns and Nouns AI. \n\n[![youtube-examples.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/xCt8cB1X/youtube-examples.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/TL5fs7mx)\n\nOur [YT Live streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSleWkgQ8_s) of daily Twitter Spaces have picked up an extra 20-30 daily listens on average, while also serving as a more permanent living archive of our Twitter content (helpful since Twitter deletes Spaces Recordings after 90 days.)\n\nSome examples of our evergreen content would be the [\"Nounsplaining Web3 Terms\"](https://youtu.be/6Tu56yn6MoA) series with Aubtoshi and SuperTightWoody, and the [\"Prop House Profiles\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY6_cpQZBpc) interview series with Toady Hawk. In both cases, these series have been produced in a way that they can be viewed either today or in 5 years and still be relevant. As we grow, especially in new mediums like video, having a healthy repertoire of interesting educational content is valuable, as new eyeballs arrive on our accounts and will be immediately greeted by helpful onboarding content.\n\nFinally, our co-branded content strategy: For example, [House of Nouns' thoughtful weekly Voter Companion show \"Prop Talk\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJe17dn9TIk&t=5s) was premiered on our YT channel in addition to their other podcast services, resulting in more views for their content and more useful content for our audience. The same can be said for Recordings of the [AI Pod weekly Discord calls.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJe17dn9TIk&t=5s) \n\nWe know that YouTube continues to be a great opportunity for future growth, and we plan to devote more resources to building out our presence and content on this platform over the coming months. \n\n\n# 2) The Noun Square as an Onboarding and Community Hub\n\nOver the past 6 months, TNS has cemented itself as a pillar of the Nouns DAO community, supporting funded projects and sub-DAOs alike, while also welcoming builders, artists and new Nouners to the DAO with open arms.      \n\n**In our estimation, this role of providing Community-As-A-Service to the DAO is every bit as important as the proliferation and distribution role outlined in the previous section.**\n\n[![tns-discord-members.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/43Qgvwch/tns-discord-members.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/940KCdJW)\n\nAfter the original Nouns discord was switched to read-only, we worked to embrace the diaspora and create a guidepost to the Nouniverse. We thoughtfully did this in our Discord server and on TNS shows, so as not to simply try and replicate what was just disbanded, but rather create a neutral space where people can learn more at their own pace and find their own way to get more involved in the Nouns ecosystem. As a result, with **966 members**, our TNS Discord is now one of the largest (if not *the* largest) active nounish servers by membership. \n\n\n\n## More Info About The SoapBox Network \n\n[![the-soapbox-network-graphic-copy.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/QdTsWCbL/the-soapbox-network-graphic-copy.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/75wjFxdX)\n\nOver the course of this past funding period, our **SoapBox Network** has grown from nothing into a weekly itinerary of 38+ spaces that have provided a turn-key platform to 15+ nounish projects and communities including *Shark DAO, Lil Nouns DAO, Lil Sisters Fund, Nouns esports, Food Nouns, Nouns Builder, UMA DAO, Gnars DAO, Nouns Africa, Nouns DAO Amigos, Nouns Brasil, InternatioNouns, Nouns Agora, House of Nouns, NounBA, Lil Toadz DAO / Cryptoadz and more.* \n\nThis initiative has empowered these nounish communities to consistently engage their membership on a weekly basis, cross-pollinate and collaborate with each other. It has also helped TNS greatly in our role of onboarding new people to Nouns, allowing our team to often say to newcomers: *\"Just spend a week listening to TNS Spaces and you will find your nounish people.\"*\n\n\n## **SoapBox is a true symbiotic \"Win-Win-Win-Win\" arrangement:** \n\n* Nouns DAO benefits from a passionate and interconnected web of communities, all employing different strategies to proliferate the ⌐◨-◨ meme to different demographics. \n* The Noun Square benefits from additional engaging content for our various distribution streams and from having multiple active funnels from which to grow our own community. \n* SoapBox partners benefit from a turn-key solution to host spaces with minimal planning or coordination required on their part, and the opportunity to reach new eyeballs from different corners of the ecosystem. \n* And finally, the Nouns community at large benefits from a full daily slate of Nounish content and a one-stop-shop to catch up on everything happening in the Nouniverse.  \n\n[![nounsamigos-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/VNZ2K6bg/nounsamigos-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/VSM76zg0) *A bilingual testimonial from Nouns DAO Amigos about their experience as a SoapBox partner.*\n\nIn addition to empowering nounish sub-DAOs, subcultures and communities, the SoapBox Network has also been a powerful tool for TNS to help other funded nounish projects with their DAO communications and user growth. Some examples:\n\n* We have partnered with **[Nouns Agora](https://nounsagora.com/)** to co-host **[weekly public DAO discussions and townhalls](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1604658668007718912?s=20&t=XqFEz89ZZsqi1CbnriseCA)** about Nouns DAO Proposals that have produced very interesting dialog and have been very well attended and received. [Yitong](https://twitter.com/zhayitong) from Agora had this to say about TNS's efforts: \n\n[![agora-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/qBLSFNrr/agora-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/YjvdGqjD)\n* We hosted a **[Technical Townhall about Rage Quit](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1604965283478884382?s=20&t=XqFEz89ZZsqi1CbnriseCA)** with The Verbs team of Elad and David, which also was very well attended and was the venue for some very important conversations between 4156, VapeApe, 0xHindsight, DigitalOIl and others. \n* We have partnered with **[House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.xyz/)** on two fronts: 1) Hosting co-branded video versions of their weekly voter companion podcast \"Prop Talk\" on The Noun Square YouTube (amplified on our Twitter), and 2) Hosting a live discussion SoapBox by the same name on Twitter Spaces weekly. [Christian](https://twitter.com/ByHardy) from HoN shares his experience here: \n\n[![house-of-nouns-quote.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/FspsFFQg/house-of-nouns-quote.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/w7td0pM7)\n\n* We have hosted on many occasions \"PopUp Soapboxes\" by request for several Nounish projects, such as:\n    1) [A Bud Light NEXT Happy Hour](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1612847677330554880?s=20&t=XqFEz89ZZsqi1CbnriseCA) (which was very well attended - we are in the process of potentially turning into a regular event.) \n    2) A [Basketball X Nouns event](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1615211446454943745?s=20&t=XqFEz89ZZsqi1CbnriseCA) in collaboration with [NounBA](https://twitter.com/nounba_wtf) and [Vesselverse](https://twitter.com/VesselVerse). \n    3) A [Bilingual Chinese-English space](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1601052527029817345?s=20&t=XqFEz89ZZsqi1CbnriseCA) featuring Noun 74 and the Chinese Cryptopunks community, which was also simulcast on Binance Live. \n    \n[![nounba-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/FzbQ1pdn/nounba-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/zHfQcnkn)\n\n**We believe that, again, in the absence of a centralized Nouns Discord, providing a public and neutral space for discussion of Nouns Proposals and DAO governance is an important and powerful part of our mandate that we hope to nurture and grow in the coming months.**\n\n\n## On-Boarding New Nouners to the DAO\n\nAnother aspect of our daily community-building efforts is our consistent commitment to reaching out and engaging with folks on Twitter, Twitter Spaces, TikTok, etc. to answer their questions about Nouns and explain how they can get involved.  \n\n**We have also reached out to new Nouners on a weekly basis to invite them on the daily Noun O' Clock show as guests and help them introduce themselves to the community.** We have had many new Nouners on the show including *Taco Noun, Digital Oil, shan96, darlington, 0xpiney, susuc, pNouns, NickyG, Nounvestment Fund, Variant Fund, Valko*, and more. Invariably they have all had positive feedback about their experience! \n\nA couple recent examples: \n\n[![monstercat-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/BQ2Nj6Sy/monstercat-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/mt27qTFN)\n\n[![digital-oil-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/DZMSB2xK/digital-oil-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/vg58mdRP)\n \n\n## The FOMO Factor\n\nTNS has also had a tangible effect on Nouner onboarding with our efforts to coordinate FOMO every night on our Noun O' Clock LIVE Twitter Spaces. In several instances, we have been asked by people to try to FOMO mint a specific Noun head, which we have done successfully and then this has often directly resulted in said Noun being purchased. *Nouns 404, 433, 453, 472, 487, 506, 532, 542, 552, 562, 569, 577 & 578 (to name a few) are all examples of Nouns we FOMO'd by request and were purchased as a result.* \n\n[![modrovsky-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/MpmXg095/modrovsky-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/LJhH1PKg)*Modrovsky, on his experience asking TNS to FOMO him an Index Card head.*\n\nWe believe playing FOMO every day has led to minting more aesthetic nouns on average also, and as part of the fun, we aim to mint nouns for cultural events and occasions too. For example, we minted a rabbit for Chinese New Year (while hosting Nouns DAO China), 2 Rose Buds for the Rose Parade, a snowman head on Christmas day, and a basketball, knowing that the nouns acquisition committee were likely to want one for [Victor](https://twitter.com/victorsolomon)'s basketball court restoration proposal.\n\n[![fomo-time.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/76cKQs5L/fomo-time.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/hzL8X0bF)\n*FOMO comic strip by TNS community member @Kimmydeuk*\n\n## On-Boarding Artists and Contributors to Nouns\n\nBy encouraging artistic expression and rewarding creation through our weekly community art contests, The Noun Square has prompted the creation of 1000's of Nounish illustrations, sculptures, food items, videos, costumes and more.\n\nUsing TNS as a launch-pad, artists from around the world have entered into the Nouniverse and have found great success. Artists that started with TNS contests have been commissioned by Nouns communities, minted their own collections, been featured in IRL exhibitions and other collections, and have begun collaborating with each other as well:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VZKy0me.jpg)\n*Special Holiday Edition mint by @0xaprilia, @ilustradoraeth, @DesenhistaRedn, @amiyoko_eth, @facuserif, @Greta_gremplin, @Messhup, many of whom were exposed to Nouns via TNS*\n\nAfter winning our contests, many artists have had the opportunity to work with us on art inspired by the daily Noun that we give away as POAPs on our Twitter Spaces. Each commissioned artist does 7 or 8 pieces of art for that week. Some examples of the 230+ POAPs we have given out since inception:\n\n[![poap-compilation-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/LX6zHr5v/poap-compilation-gif.gif)](https://postimg.cc/Ff8fpCjJ)\n\nAnd here's a brief reel showing many of the beautiful Nounish art pieces created by our community members over the past months:\n\n[![contest-supercut.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/3NdxD2cG/contest-supercut.gif)](https://postimg.cc/D43T94Ff) \n\n## A Few TNS Artist Success Stories:\nAfter being introduced to Nouns via one of our earliest art contests, talented South Korean artist [Jhee](https://twitter.com/jheeart_nft) has gone on to mint collections including her popular watercolor-styled \"With Noun\" collection. Her art is really beautiful:\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MtqCAsM.jpg)\n\n\nShe has also been featured in IRL galleries, created merchandise and hosted her own exhibitions! \n\n\n[Arash](https://twitter.com/ArashSlacker), an Iranian animator living in Turkey, was on-boarded by several members of the TNS team. He premiered his [Shrimpy Burger Nouns](https://youtu.be/nQIsqHWERoE) music video on TNS YouTube, collaborated with Nouns Sounds on [\"The Bomb\"](https://youtu.be/cQjWXc2EHQk) music video, is creating a pretty cool [Nouns Video Game](https://youtu.be/Xz-ouU8xErE), and more.\n\n[![arash-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/HnLFfjVm/arash-gif.gif)](https://postimg.cc/WFQ9ZNGY)\n\n\n[0xAprilia](https://twitter.com/0xaprilia) came to Nouns via TNS art contests and has launched their own collections, created artwork for Nouncil, helped with multiple Nouns Proposals' art, and will be a resident artist at boards.wtf as well. Some of her art:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BJthO5e.jpg)\n\n[Duckhead](https://twitter.com/_duckhead) entered into an [Unminted Noun Heads](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1565289442302099456?s=20&t=8XVpnHHkMX1IvWAgeqFRsg) contest and created a beautiful Box Noun Resin Figurine, which later was produced and sold out its initial order. They've continued to create more Nouns as figures and create one of a kind Nouns resin art!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nF7SFbT.jpg)\n\n\nIn addition to empowering hundreds of artists, TNS has also funded social goods efforts around the world with challenges like our [Cleanup Contest](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1567969949829693440), which inspired community cleanup efforts the world over. One of the winners of this competition, [Davin](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye), **went on to be funded by Nouns Prop House to do a larger cleanup effort, and then eventually founded Nouns DAO Africa as a result of these initiatives!**\n\n## Two Successful Trial Prop House Rounds:\n\nTo complement our efforts to fund Nounish artists through our consistent Twitter art contests, we wanted to allocate a portion of our Prize budget to pilot [two Prop House Rounds](https://prop.house/the-noun-square) to extend the same kind of support to other creators and builders in our community. \n\nWe coordinated two rounds, one with 5 prizes of 2 ETH each, and one with 10 prizes of 1 ETH. In both cases, we were very impressed with the quantity and quality of submissions. In fact, there were so many quality submissions, we ended up awarding a total of 3 extra Bonus Prizes as well. We received 63 proposals over both rounds, and here are just a few of the projects that were funded and have executed:\n\n* A team that created a [substack newsletter](https://prop.house/the-noun-square/round-1/1727) to post summaries of every Noun O' Clock LIVE Twitter Spaces for those who missed. \n* A Portuguese language Twitter Spaces called *Bora Buildar Brasil*  that is airing [weekly on TNS SoapBox](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1613830382323105793?s=20&t=8XVpnHHkMX1IvWAgeqFRsg).\n* A collection of [custom made resin trophies](https://prop.house/the-noun-square/round-1/1714) made by [Duckhead](https://twitter.com/_duckhead) in the image of the TNS mascot \"Nouny Clock.\" \n* A [series of animated shorts](https://twitter.com/MALCOM_ERANDA/status/1586408060171747330?s=20&t=8XVpnHHkMX1IvWAgeqFRsg) based on memorable clips from our Twitter Spaces shows. \n* A [tree planting operation](https://twitter.com/NounsCare) in the Philippines. \n* & many more!\n\n\n\n\n# 3) Project Goals For The Next 6 Months\n\nThese are the goals and target metrics we will strive to achieve over the next 6 months:\n\n**Broad Strategic Goals:**\n* Continue our unbroken consistent streak of Noun O' Clock Twitter Spaces as an important daily touchpoint for the community, and effective onboarding funnel for people new to Nouns. We will continue to keep our Spaces content engaging and interesting, and pursue bigger guests even more regularly to draw in larger crowds and continue/accelerate our current trend of growth.\n* Increase production of educational/evergreen video content for YouTube, and concentrate on continued growth of YouTube following and engagement.\n* Continue to build and grow the TNS TikTok accounts followers and engagement in both English and Portuguese.  \n* Continue to offer distribution and DAO communications support to Nounish projects such as Agora, House of Nouns and Nouns AI + providing support and additional distribution for Aubtoshi's Nouns On The Air Podcast Series.  \n* Maintain and grow the SoapBox network, including expanding it to some communities on the periphery of Nouns and possibly suitable communities outside the ecosystem. \n* Continue to make a concerted effort to reach out to all new Nouners and invite them on NOC LIVE + help them orient themselves in the DAO as best we can. \n* Host and moderate thoughtful DAO discourse on Proposals on a weekly basis.\n* Continue to ideate and administer creative art contests that produce positive social media engagement and amazing User Generated Content, plus attracts and onboards talented artists from around the world into the ecosystem.  \n* Continue to experiment with and document decentralized project management and team compensation (all team comp disbursed by recurring retro rounds according to contribution and/or grants for specific projects completed.) \n* Experiment with alternate language versions of TNS Twitter, as we have been trialing with a TNS Spanish and TNS Portuguese Account. \n* Be a leader in the Nouns space on the front of finding paths toward sustainability (more on this in the \"Sustainability Strategy\" section below.)\n\n**Specific Metric Goals:**\n\n* Grow Twitter following to minimum 11K over the next 6 months (which would make our account the largest nounish project account by followers after @nounsdao)\n* Grow total Twitter impressions to 20MM+\n* Grow total Listens metric to 120K+\n* Organically grow YouTube subscribership to 690+ with consistent and quality content (minimum 2 pieces of video content per week.)\n* Build TNS TikTok accounts to 50K+ combined followers and 12MM+ combined views. (Target of 200 videos posted with consistent cadence over the next 6 months.)  \n* Allocate 70+ ETH to builders and artists through art contests/commissions and community project funding. \n* Challenge ourselves to raise 50ETH in revenue over the next 6 months to defray our operations budget with a combination of crypto-native and media-native experiments (more on this in the \"Sustainability Strategy\" section below.)\n* Onboard at least one new artist to Nouns per month through contests, POAP commissions or other community initiatives. \n* Land strategic partnerships with at least two brands/communities outside the Nouns ecosystem. \n\n\n# 4) The Team\n\n**The Noun Square continues to operate with a novel decentralized project management system loosely based on the original Nouncil governance documents.** Members of both the Core and Support teams can rotate in and out as needed, depending on schedule and commitments, allowing others to step in and step up as needed. All compensation is calculated by periodic retro round allocations, or by specific project-based grants. \n\nThis format has allowed interested community members to land in TNS from a contest or a Twitter space, start contributing, and then become part of the Support Team or even the Core Team based on nothing but merit, effort and output. \n\nRunning the daily operations of TNS is no small task and encompasses myriad responsibilities, including but not limited to: \n\n*Production and planning for daily NOC show, Administration of SoapBox Spaces, schedule and coordination of Hosting and co-hosting of daily show, creation, editing and publication of YouTube and TikTok content, general content ideation and strategy, POAP artist coordination and administration, POAP creation and delivery, contest ideation, administration and execution, tracking and administration of contest prizes and payments, retro round administration and payroll, administration of Prop House rounds, booking guests for all shows, Twitter and other social engagement, maintaining Show schedule and Tweeting Spaces daily, onboarding conversations, business and partnership development, Discord management and moderation etc.*\n\n**Core Team (And most Common Responsibilities):**\n* [Toady Hawk](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk) (Founder, project management & Strategy, Twitter management, Space hosting, Coordination/Administration, Business development) \n* [Aubtoshi](https://twitter.com/aubtoshi_nft) (Space hosting, video content, coordination/administration)\n* [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi) (High Level Strategy, POAP coordination, Contest Payments, Co-hosting, Discord/YouTube admin)\n* [Joshua Fisher](https://twitter.com/JoshuaFisher) (Contest ideation and coordination, Hosting, High Level Strategy)\n* [SuperTightWoody](https://twitter.com/SuperTightWoody) (Discord admin, High Level Strategy, music)\n* [Xargs](https://twitter.com/mamaxargs) (SoapBox scheduling, backend administration of scheduling, international channel moderation and international community outreach)\n* [RobotFishGirl](https://twitter.com/RobotFishGirl) (Hosting, discord moderation, video content editing)\n* [Noun 142](https://twitter.com/1fortytwo) (Founder, Advisor, High Level Strategy)\n\n**Support Team (And most common tasks):**\n* [Symbiotech](https://twitter.com/Symbiotech) (Administration, Discord content, Twitter Spaces technical hosting)\n* [Al409](https://twitter.com/7x7x7eth) (Hosting most SoapBox spaces, general administration as needed)\n* [Cardno](https://twitter.com/CardnoNFT) (Guest management, space hosting)\n* [NounFungible Nikki](https://www.tiktok.com/@nonfungiblenikki) (TikTok strategy, content creation and development)\n* [Hypnos](https://twitter.com/hypnoseffect) (Tiktok content strategy and video editing)\n* [JP](https://twitter.com/eusou_jp) (TikTok content strategy and creation, Portuguese language TT and Twitter account)\n* PooPiePie (YouTube streaming)\n* [Santhosh](https://twitter.com/vellayan_0) (Essential Non-North American hours administration and scheduling, SoapBox Hosting)\n* [Satori](https://twitter.com/0xSatori) (Administration, support, guest booking)\n* [Akva](https://twitter.com/Akva556) (Portuguese language support, hosting)\n* [BK](https://twitter.com/0xbk_) (Reports)\n* [Prof Werder](https://twitter.com/ProfWerder) (Twitter admin and hosting)\n* [Kyro Wolf](https://www.instagram.com/kyrowolf/) (Art, branding and design)\n* [Jhee](https://twitter.com/jheeart_nft) (art)\n* [Volky](https://twitter.com/volkyeth) (NOMO dev / big brain)\n\nWe have also kept public records of every single retro round we have completed for team compensation to date (to our knowledge we are the only Nouns-funded project to have provided this level of operational transparency). Nouners are welcome to review the document [here](\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-zmEFFLxUszyKZzo8CJP6KlXC581NkPLtek4GN6h7T8/edit#gid=977336365).\n\n# 5) Proposed Budget:\n\n**Monthly expenditures August-Present:**\n*Team Comp and misc operations: 38 ETH\nContest Prizes, art commissions, community project grants: 12 ETH\n(We continued operations through January as a bonus)*\n\n**New Budget:**\nMonthly Team Compensation Budget: 42 ETH \nMonthly contest Prizes, community art commissions, community project grants: 11.17 ETH\n\n*Total Ask Per Month = 53.17 X 6 Month term = 319 ETH (Before Sustainability Efforts, See Below.)*\n\n# 6) Sustainability Strategy \n\nThere has been some discussion in the DAO recently about the self-sustainablity of Nouns-funded projects. Notably, Nounder 4156 mentions here on Twitter that many beloved Nounish projects could be endangered in the medium-to-long term if they don't think seriously about a path to sustainability.  \n\n[![4156-sustainability.png](https://i.postimg.cc/CLbF2Yxg/4156-sustainability.png)](https://postimg.cc/KRvSK6Tq)\n\nThat is why at TNS, we are implementing a 2-pronged strategy to gradually reduce our dependence on DAO funding, while continuing to bring value to the DAO and the community at large. In addition to reasonable DAO funding for provision of Community-As-A-Service and growing media distribution, we will also try:\n\n1) Crypto-Native experiments in self-funding; and\n2) Traditional Media experiments in self-funding.\n\n**To reduce our total ask of the DAO, we are challenging ourselves to produce 50 ETH of revenue through a combination of a) NOMO Nouns daily edition mints, b) a TNS Nouns Fork using Builder DAO that celebrates talented artists in our community, and c) tiered sponsorship opportunities of our media channels.**\n\n\n## A) NOMO NOUNS: A TNS-Developed Addition to the FOMO Experience \n\n\nNOMO NOUNS is a gamified daily edition mint, bootstrapped and developed in-house by TNS (shout out [Volky.eth](https://twitter.com/volkyeth).) It kicks off directly after FOMO Nouns and allows our audience on Noun O' Clock LIVE to pick one Noun that got passed over during FOMO (and is soon to be NO MO'), and save it from eternal blockchain purgatory by clicking like mad.  \n\n[![nomo.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/sDwMSTgB/nomo.gif)](https://postimg.cc/KRvSK6Tq)\n\n[![9999-nomo-testimonial.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/jSsDP21Z/9999-nomo-testimonial.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/mt5ZGLBH)\n\nOnce the game is over (about 60 seconds), the winning NOMO Noun is minted as a 24H open edition that is very affordable, but goes up in price every 15 minutes thereafter. So far in the first 6 weeks of beta, the feedback from our community has been overwhelmingly positive. People love the game, and have been minting the NOMOs even though we haven't fully developed either the game or the usefulness of the NFTs yet (it's currently mostly just for fun and *provenance.*) \n\n\n\n**We have raised over 7 ETH from NOMO so far, and all proceeds have gone directly to the TNS treasury (which allowed us to operate for a bonus month in January.)**\n\n[![41-nomo-comment.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/HL1HFz7B/41-nomo-comment.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/YvRJW1RW)\n\nAdditionally, our TNS partner dev **Volky** is currently working on several improvements to the game and interface, and NOMO V2 will be released very soon. **Our vision is for NOMO to become an efficient single landing page for listeners of Noun O' Clock LIVE and beyond, and we're excited to roll out new features soon to that end.** In the meantime, just keep on clickin'!\n\n## B) TNS DAO\n\nIn the next 30-45 days, we plan to launch a TNS DAO by forking Nouns using Nouns Builder. We have some exciting plans in motion to partner with and empower some of the incredible artists in our TNS community. We also have novel plans to integrate NOMO Nouns owners into the structure of the DAO, and ultimately envision a future in the medium-term where auction proceeds can net out the cost of much of our contest prizes and community project grants, in a true virtuous cycle of art and proliferation.   \n\n## C) Sponsorships \n\nWe are currently in discussions with several crypto-native organizations about potential secondary sponsorships (after Nouns DAO) of our Twitter Spaces, as well as video content on our YT and TikTok. We are working to balance the traditional media model with a more crypto-native approach to sponsorship, and with any confirmed partner collaborations, we will ensure that both the partner and our audience benefit mutually and safely. \n\n**With the three initiatives above, we believe we can meet our goal of raising 50 ETH in revenue over a 6 month period, and we are excited both for the challenge, and to set an example in the DAO as a project seeking paths to semi-self-reliance.**\n\n# 7) The Revised Ask\n\n## Projected 6 Month Operations Budget of 319 ETH, minus 50 ETH of targeted TNS revenue = **269 ETH Total Ask**\n\n\n\n# 8) Conclusion \nTo sum it all up, The Noun Square is a growing media hub and onboarding/educational platform for Nouns DAO and the Nouniverse. We aim to bring value to existing and new people through many impactful initiatives, as outlined in this proposal, and we will continue to iterate and improve daily (the beauty of creating nounish media every single day.)\n\n**The detailed metrics and information in this prop are important and demonstrate the tangible value that TNS brings to the broader Nouns community. But numbers and details can also be overwhelming in a world of information overload.** Numbers and details don’t tell the whole story. We hope that this prop and the discussion around the funding and sustainability of TNS will allow you to see and hear the story of what we’ve been able to build alongside our audience: **an onboarding hub for the Nouniverse, and a cc0 media company, kickstarted by Nouns.**\n\nWhat ESPN’s Sportscenter is to most sports fans, that’s the role TNS is playing for many currently in their Nounish journey. And it will continue to hold that place as the next 1000 come into the Nouniverse, and the 1000 after that. This prop can’t properly tell the stories of many artists who went from relative obscurity to sustainable work thanks to their onboarding to Nouns. The prop can’t tell of the 50 builders who were either ushered into Prop House victories for the first time, or brought onto the TNS team as their first chance to work in web 3, or who found people to create and build alongside in a nounish subdao, thanks to TNS. \n\nIt can't tell how TNS was a springboard to new ventures in the Nouniverse. How we were a shot of energy into the proliferation stars of NounsDAO Brazil, or Africa. **And the prop can’t tell the story of 100+ who have found their footing in web3, found their tribe in the Nouniverse, and will find themselves on a Nounish web3 journey for years to come.** \n\nThese people are the next stars of the Nouniverse.

Resulting in a community that feels less connected to Nouns, because they cannot participate directly in the governance process.\n\n**Federation closes this gap by providing a way for communities to directly vote on Nouns proposals onchain. We call this crossDAO governance.**\n\n[![goal](https://i.postimg.cc/DwhF0yv3/Untitled.png)](https://postimg.cc/VdK2Hw0K)\n\nMoving forward we are extending Federation to support all forms of governance in the ecosystem such as integrating with Prop House and Nouns Builder, while also providing opportunities for owners of Nouns to generate value from them through new experiments like vote bidding.\n\nTo do this, we are seeking 225 ETH in funding to continue the development of Federation.\n\n# Team \n[wiz](https://twitter.com/0xWiz_) - creator [federation](https://federation.wtf); [Wizards DAO](https://wizardsdao.com); [delegate](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/oxwiz.eth);\n\n[ripe](https://twitter.com/ripe0x) - Nounish builder and [delegate](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/ripe0x.eth). Designer, and developer with over 15 years of experience creating digital products & websites and winner of multiple Nouns Prop House rounds. A few Nounish contributions include: [Nouns Explore on nouns.wtf](https://nouns.wtf/explore), [Nounish CV (prototype)](https://nounish.netlify.app/), [nogs.wtf,](https://www.nogs.wtf/) [zorggles.wtf](http://zorggles.wtf/), [Noggle Factory](https://www.nogglefactory.wtf/) & [⌐◧-◧.app](https://github.com/ripe0x/noggles.app)\n\n[![timeline](https://i.postimg.cc/nrGPRm5H/timeline.png)](https://postimg.cc/jnCcCDt9)\n# Progress\nAs a winner of the [Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns/nouns-governance-clients) mandated governance round (Aug ‘22), wiz took Federation from an idea to public infrastructure used by communities in the ecosystem. All code is open source and has been publicly available since the very first commit: [federation repository](https://github.com/nounish/federation/). \n\nMetrics:\n- 40+ Nouns proposal votes cast through Federation contracts\n- 5+ Nouns delegated to Federation contracts\n- Proposal passed for Lil Nouns adoption (which holds 16 Nouns)\n\nCommunities currently on Federation:\n- [Gnars](https://gnars.wtf/) \n- Goop Troop\n\nComing to Federation:\n- [Lil Nouns](https://lilnouns.wtf/)\n- [The Park](https://twitter.com/thepark)\n- [Wizards DAO](https://wizardsdao.com)\n\nDiscussions are currently underway to onboard other communities in the ecosystem that have expressed interest in using Federation such as [SharkDAO](https://sharks.wtf/), [Purple](https://purple.construction/), and [PGodjira](https://twitter.com/pgodjira)\n\n# Future roadmap and outcomes\n[![crossdaomock](https://i.postimg.cc/tgfdbgPF/crossdaomock.png)](https://postimg.cc/v1rxLb0m)\n\nWe believe it’s time to take Federation from a POC to a scalable protocol designed for participating in crossDAO governance and generating value from Nouns ownership.\n\n## Make crossDAO governance easy to understand, simple to do, and commonplace\n- Design & build the new Federation v1 application and website\n- Simplify the process of casting votes as a community\n- Enable support for existing and future Nounish DAOs created via Nouns builder\n- Continue onboarding Noun holding communities to Federation\n- Community voting in Prop House rounds\n- Optimize contracts to reduce storage costs, provide gas refunds, and execution incentives (MEV)\n- Self directed contract deployment and management\n\n## AutoBidder and Ongoing experimention\nWe plan to continuously release experiments that add value to the Nouns ecosystem. One area we are going to explore is an auto-bidder that enables a MEV driven approach to participating in Nouns auctions for communities and individuals.\n- Allows bidding on Nouns auctions automatically\n- Configurable max bid amounts\n- Gas refunds and execution incentives\n\n## Vote bidding\n[![votebidding](https://i.postimg.cc/L85ZspmD/bidonvotes.png)](https://postimg.cc/cvqJDPgt)\n\nExperimentation with crossDAO governance has led to the creation of a [novel vote bidding protocol](https://github.com/nounish/federation/commit/4ab02886abd26d405791fc399db57cc01034cd6b) aimed at giving Nouns holders the ability to monetize their governance rights. Turning the acquisition of a Noun into a revenue generating opportunity for individuals and communities alike.\n\nIn January, we ran an experiment auctioning off a **SINGLE** Noun vote. This led to the following metrics one week after launch:\n- 2 unique bidders\n- 3 votes cast\n- 0.5 ETH value created\n\nThere is a lot more value that can be unlocked with vote bidding and we want to heavily invest in its future development. You can learn more and see it in action by visiting [bids.federation.wtf](http://bids.federation.wtf).\n\n## Community outreach, supportive content and learning material\nIn addition to product development, we will focus on creating content that introduces people to the concepts and benefits of crossDAO governance and vote bidding, and tutorials that show interesting ways that these primitives can be used in the Nouns ecosystem. For example, teaching others how to use Federation with Nouns builder, PartyBid, or showing others how to stand up their own voting blocs (political parties).\n\n# Ask\n**225 ETH** to fund the continued development of [federation.wtf](http://federation.wtf) and its ecosystem for at least 6 months. (There are no plans to stop development after)\n- Engineering and Design (175 ETH)\n- OpEx including infrastructure costs, bounties, artwork, content, marketing (50 ETH)\n\nIf this proposal passes 1/2 of the funds will immediately be released to the team.

This will provide another entry point for individuals to the Nouns ecosystem through fine art collecting on the Nifty Gateway platform.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zuADEJp.png)\n\nWe want to create a recurring exhibition that features custom Nounish pieces created by two artists from each continent, participating in the web3 ecosystem. One established and the other emerging. This will create a unique and limited collection, aligned with the Nouns ethos, allowing a new collective of talent to spread the good of Nouns, globally, through doing what they love.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/U9EK1gx.png)\n\n[Proposal 190](https://nouns.wtf/vote/190) has shown there is high demand to collect Nounish art pieces that are custom and crafted. 3,526 NFTs were minted as an open edition of one historical piece, and now we believe we can create something special that [Nifty Gateway](https://www.niftygateway.com/) collectors will flock to. \n\nThere is also clear evidence of fine-art generating profit and bringing awareness to Nouns in [Brandon Mighty's The Myth of Noun series on SuperRare.](https://superrare.com/series/0xca4607aad52f654cf6357895c397094c077a3236) Which has amassed 16.3 ETH in sales from a single artist's creations alone.\n\nRather than a one-off open edition mint of a historic piece or using one artist to tell the Nouns story, lets collaborate with many fine artists and give people beautiful Nounish art that they can collect and cherish.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Yd4uWoi.png)\n\nAll proceeds from the exhibition will be split 50/50 between the artists and the Nouns treasury. Not only does this provide fair compensation for the artists, but it also has the potential to generate returns for the DAO and further support its mission.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QOFD1dx.gif)\n\nWith Nifty Gateway's new exclusive publishers feature, it creates the perfect oppurtunity for Nouns to host a curated fine-art collection. Below are some stats on past Nifty drops, from the original Nifty Gateway Curated drops, to recent drops utilising the select publisher feature:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Xe8iFr2.png)\n\nWe already have the storefront set up at [⌐◨-◨.to/ng](https://xn----vpoz1kba.to/ng) and it's ready to fill with beautiful Nounish art. We'll commission two artists from each continent to create one Nounish piece of art each.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/woQncKS.png)\n\n The curated selection ranges from emerging Nounish artists to already established Web3 OG artists, to give opportunity and add high value to the collection.

About 40 photos taken in 2006 were selected. Each photo has a story. They are portraits of the most varied possible, which will act as guides that will dictate the progress of our itinerary in the village.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rjrMvLM.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2MG7rXs.jpg)\n\n*What would it be like to meet the young Fatou N'Dei, now 20 years old?*\n\n*What stories does she carry with her?*\n\n*What was the village like for her at that time when you played in the rain?*\n\n*What was your father's fate, Badou?*\n\n*Did Fatou N'Dei follow the statistics and become a mother in her youth?*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/js6EJen.jpg)\n\n\nThe aim of the project is to make an observational documentary, sometimes poetic, sometimes in the photo essay and at other times with backstage coverage, with a making-of behavior camera. A cross between these subgenres will bring harmonic diversity, as the raw material will always be the same: the past of the people and the village. In the footsteps of photographer Daniel Leite will be followed by a small team — which, with the necessary setback, will film these encounters. These same steps will be followed by the past, very closely with pictures the photographer produced in 2006. Whenever necessary, stories and images from the past will gain the screen, either by telling curiosities, or showing, through the contact sheet that will gain the canvas, the photographic step by step until the photo that he judged to be the main one.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/MM1pQio.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/426341855?embedded=true&source=video_title&owner=2297917)\n\n\n.\n\n\n# What we will deliver\n\n1. * **Nouns will sign as the sole sponsor of all works**\n1. * **The logo will appear on a animation card before the movie starts**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/buYkVSY.gif)\n\n1. * A feature film of at least 90 minutes entitled “More past than future”\n\n1. * The logo will be present in all publicity material for the feature.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/o7EPDLq.jpg)\n\n1. * **A short film in a making-off style of at least 20 minutes, showing the entire process of the film, from capturing by Nouns, building our legacy and shooting the film.**\n1. * A 300 page black and white photo book telling what happened in the lives of the characters that will be re-photographed. Before and after portraits and small text extracts that punctuate the transformations of their lives in the span of 17 years.  Note: The book will be sold and all proceeds will revert to the village of Kabadio\n1. * **A Nounish action with the village football team (More details below)**\n1. * Photographic exhibition / Vernissage / Launch of the feature and book in RJ\n1. * **Entry of the feature film and short film on the world circuit of film festivals**\n1. * **All proceeds from the film will go entirely to Kabadio.**\n1. * Professional press office working on the promotion of the film\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m0jKyqO.jpg)\n\n# The legacy\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zMhlAWP.jpg)\n\n\nThe Casamansa region is a conflagrated region, there is a separatist war there that has lasted more than 30 years. The young people of Kabadio are leaving the village for Europe, through illegal and very dangerous routes. Some manage to finish the path, but they are shocked by the illegality in Europe, others disappear.\n\nThe rural exodus is currently one of the biggest problems in the region and that is why the Permakabadio association works directly with young people in order to avoid choosing this path.\n\nAmong the countless activities offered by Permakabadio, it was in football that they found their greatest strength. Called Asc Bindoula, the association's team was created in order to develop the concept of youth belonging to a much larger context.\n\nMore than 20 athletes work hard throughout the year with the aim of classifying the team in the biggest competition in the state of Casamansa, Intervilarejos, the real World Cup in the region.\n\nTaking place during Senegal's monsoon, one of the most difficult times of the year, where life becomes slow and all locomotion complex. Intervilarejo is a breather and a portal to a new competitive and festive reality.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LIC6Maz.jpg)\n[Permakabadio's Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permakabadio)\n\nOur goal is to bring even more strength to the team and its athletes, so we want to sponsor the team next year through the following actions:\n\n* Buy of a new uniform with Nouns as a sponsor\n* Buy of sports equipment for the team (balls, cleats, shin guards…)\n* Workshop with local experts, players, coaches.\n* Renovation of the Kabadio football field\n* Construction of ASC Bindoula's CT (Meeting and Study Room)\n* Library around sports and decolonial themes\n* Buy a laptop for the trainer\n* Buy of a projector to be attached to the laptop for use in viewing games and tactics\n\nAll the amount raised with the release of the first feature was fully transferred to the village in the form of resources or support for projects.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AvhUsXB.jpg)\n\n\n\nWe facilitated the arrival of energy to the Bindoula permaculture farm, which today has 20 young people working directly in its operation. We helped in the construction of the Community Bakery located on the same farm, we donated half a ton of flour in order to speed up their bakery activities. In addition to donating food to the community and helping with emergencies in the village.\n\nIn this new project it will be no different, all the amount raised will be fully reverted to Kabadio and the maintenance of the legacy that Nouns will leave in the village.\n\n# Why Nouns should fund this proposal\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/K1ZKVE5.jpg)\n\n\n “More past than future” talks about a people, a little visited part of Africa. Giving voice to its population is to bring out our ancestry, as it was from the Senegambia sector (where Kabadio is located) where the first Mandinga enslaved in the Africa x Brazil diasporic movement came from.\n\nThe potential of this project was already proven in our first feature, in which we were present in more than 40 film festivals, passing through 12 countries and remaining in the Amazon Prime Video documentary catalog for 2 years, being watched by more than 300k people worldwide.\n\nOur bonds are not frivolous, our relationships are not ephemeral. We have followed the life of this village for more than 15 years and we intend to participate more and more in its development.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1qJC2Tf.jpg)\n\n\nSponsoring our documentary and book gives Nouns the opportunity to take their glasses into the most prestigious film festivals in the world, project their brand into the streaming universe, participate in an arts publication of historical importance and thereby affirm even more the strength of the community and its ability to be involved in big projects.\n\nIn addition to the public understanding the importance of Nouns in carrying out these artistic projects, they will understand that it was the initial vector for a legacy that belongs to the village. The films and the book make up an archive that will be entirely dedicated to the village's causes until the end of time.\n\nOur cinema is humanitarian, all resources captured in this proposal will be donated to the village of Kabadio, located in the south of Senegal in the region of Casamance. Moving the local economy and leaving a true legacy for the people.\n\n# Budget\n\n**The amount requested is to finance the project for one year of work**\n\n**90 days** of Pre-production\n**45 days** of Recording \n**3 months** of Post-production \n**6 months** of Promotion *(festivals, streamers, social networks, newspapers, magazines and websites)*\n\n* **Team** \n    * Director / Director of Photography (Daniel Leite) - 5 ETH\n    * Director of Photography SEG UNIT (Felipe O'neill) - 2.5 ETH \n    * Sound Director (Wilson) - 2.5 ETH \n    * Camera Assistant / Logger (Hugo) - 2 ETH\n    * Producer / Director of Making Off (lcsant) - 5 ETH\n    * Local Producer (Mamadou Diop) - 2 ETH\n* Total - 19 ETH \n \n* **Equipment rental**\n    * Camera lenses and accessories - 2.5 ETH \n        * Black Magic 6k pro with extra batteries and cards\n        * Tripod Manfroto 504hd\n        * Fixed Lens Zeiss zf 18/25/35/50/85/100mm f:1.4 to f:2.8\n        * Lens Zooms: 24:70 / 16:35 / 70:200mm f:2.8\n        * TV Logic 5' monitor\n    * Sound equipment - 1.5 ETH \n        * Sound Device Recorder 788t\n        * Sound Console DeviCE CL-8\n        * BPL 130 vmont battery\n        * Sony urxb2 tx\n        * Sennheiser ew100g4 kits\n        * 1 boom pole -- ktec avalon CARBON\n        * Neumann Kmr 81i\n        * Haness orca or 40\n        * Tentacle sync box\n        * Electronic clapperboard deneck ts3\n    * HDs - 1 ETH\n* Total - 5 ETH \n\n* **Logistics and Production**\n    * Plane ticket Brazil X Africa - 7 ETH \n        * 5 two-way team tickets \n    * Local Transport - 2.5 ETH \n        * 2 car rental with local drivers for transport during the 45 days of travel\n    * Local Stay - 3.5 ETH \n        * Stay for a crew of 6 during the 45 days of shooting\n    * Food - 2 ETH \n        * Food for a team of 6 people during the 45 days of shooting\n* Total - 15 ETH \n\n* **Post production** (Budget for 3 months of post production)\n    * Film Editing 4 ETH \n    * Making-off Editting 1 ETH\n    * Sound Mixing 2.5 ETH\n    * Motion Designer 1.5 ETH \n    * Translation and Subtitles 2 ETH \n        * Both the film and the making-off will be translated and subtitled into Portuguese and English\n    * Photo book printing 4 ETH\n        * Writing / Revelation / Scanning: 2 Months\n        * Design/ Printing: 1 Month\n        * Distribution: 3 to 5 Months\n    * Film Disclosure 3 ETH\n        * 6 months of Promotion *(festivals, streamers, social networks, newspapers, magazines and websites)*\n* Total - 18 ETH\n\n* **Kabadio legacy**\n    * Purchase of a new uniform with Nouns as a sponsor 2 ETH\n    * Purchase of sports equipment for the team (balls, cleats, shin guards…) 1 ETH\n    * Workshop with local experts, players, coaches. 1.5 ETH\n    * Renovation of the Kabadio football field 2 ETH\n    * Construction of ASC Bindoula's CT (Meeting and Study Room) 3 ETH\n    * Library around sports and decolonial themes 1 ETH\n    * Purchase a laptop for the trainer 1 ETH\n    * Purchase of a projector to be attached to the laptop for use in viewing games and tactics 0.5 ETH\n* Total - 12 ETH\n\n* **TOTAL PROPOSAL** \n   \n   **69 ETH** \n\n.\n\n**Proposed Transactions**\n\n0x207a97e0d3339059C555D04374499c03Df47775D - lcsant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n# Who is making the proposal - Lcsant\n\n**https://twitter.com/lcsant_eth**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cpqP0c5.jpg)"},{"blockNumber":16578456,"blockHash":"0x6d6f5ec907d21bc5c3add92b10bbf2ffd132cd116a5b9d1fe27763d2b0f26ea9","transactionIndex":222,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x7706026736285986b06159808447fd24db64bc692b8680e9afdff26c9eca9c15","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":233,"proposer":"0x57b21441c24746697Db4d9553f800f42f8A9Ec12","targets":["0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":16614456,"endBlock":16650456,"description":"# Nouns Acquisition Committee - delegation changes\n\nThe Nouns Acquisition Committee (NAC) was established by Proposal 44, and has successfully acquired Nouns on behalf of the DAO for later distribution to builders as compensation.\n\nThe NAC Multisig (0x9298B97dE93784635900163e582A5D9e570f35a5) currently custodies 3 nouns in escrow on behalf of builders with approved but incomplete proposals.

The team has enjoyed every little step of the journey and we hope watching it is as magical as it has been making it.\n\nWe ended up writing a long form breakdown of Harriett - a bubbly wizard’s hat who always sees the cauldron half-full, and Grummelot - a grumpy old spellmaster stuck in his ways. An origin story and full season arcs are ready to be turned into a full animated series if the opportunity arises.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FY8CnDF.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KeV1Mnq.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gfer8kq.jpg)\n\n______________\n\n[Prop 190](https://nouns.wtf/vote/190) described an idea, that \"by minting... from the DAO via a proposal, it is becoming Nouns DAO canon. Similar to how the DAO added in new head attributes via a proposal, Nouns can continue to explore and experiment with new models of CC0 art and production and minting directly from the DAO is a new tool for the organization to directly release and distribute the most important artifacts from the community. It’s not hard to see how this can advance Nouns into a crypto-native form of Movie Studio, Production House, Art Museum and so on.\"\n\nThe film will be released as a timed open edition for a price of 0.05 ETH. This means it will be available for anyone to mint for the premiere week, which will be approximately the 20th Feb - 27th Feb, (beginning from proposal execution). Proceeds from sale will be split between Nouns DAO and the Wizards Hat production team 50/50.\n\nAgain, we echo the sentiment of [prop 190](https://nouns.wtf/vote/190): \"We are excited to experiment with DAO NFT releases as an additional value capture mechanism, and potentially create a simple and repeatable model for any creator, community and brand in the ecosystem to put forward amazing artifacts to be minted via Nouns.\"\n\nThis edition will be minted with [Zora](https://zora.co/), and will be available to mint onchain as well as watch the film at [premiere.wtf](http://premiere.wtf/) after the proposal is executed.\n\nFind out more about what we've been up to here: [twitter.com/nouns_stories](https://twitter.com/nouns_stories)\n\nNote: the Zora

Finish development, testing and deploy a generalized NFT random distributor which enables any proposer to propose distribution of current or future NFTs in our Treasury. The distributor makes use of new tech I call “functional props”; meaning the prop itself determines how many NFTs to distribute at execution time as a function of the prop’s vote counts.\n2. Develop, test, audit and deploy a contract that enables proposers to ask for functional funding. Functional funding allows proposers to suggest a funding range within which they are willing to execute a prop. The actual funding amount received is determined by the prop’s vote counts.\n\n# Why Functional Props?\n\n*Cool tech, cool experiment. But how is it useful?*\n\nFor both NFT distribution and funding it’s a more efficient way of achieving “middle ground”; a form of consensus.\n\nThink about it as a way of taking an on-chain average of all opinions.\n\nThe current alternative is an attention-deprived off-chain back and forth between proponent and community to arrive at a proposal price point or distribution number.\n\nThis [back and forth I had with Gami](https://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil/status/1622308820658651139) goes deeper. An extract:\n\n### What stops people from just setting the lower threshold to their ideal amount and upper threshold as buffer?\n\nIf you set the lower threshold to ideal amount you increase the risk of the prop not passing vs a vanilla prop ceteris paribus.\n\n### As for the thresholds, how would voters know that proposer set their levels in such a way?\n\nVoters will know the range of funding. When voting, you know that if there is intense support, the prop will hit the upper part of the range. If it barely passes, it will hit the lower part.\n\nYou base your vote on that.\n\nIf you feel comfortable with the funding range, you vote FOR. The more people feel comfortable with the range, the higher the funding.\n\nIt gives quadratic funding vibes.\n\n### When put like that it feels like it would alleviate some of the anxiety around voting too. Like sharing the load in a clever way. Nice.\n\nRight. Well put. Like smoothing out the noise in a signal with a moving average filter.\n\n# Phase 1: Generalized NFT Distributor\n\nBefore functional funding comes functional NFT distribution.\n\nI am the dev and proposer behind [Prop 199](https://nouns.wtf/vote/199) which passed 226 : 9. Prop 199 was a successful experiment to distribute 50 Nouns Vision Glasses from our Treasury to Nouners at random.\n\nI have developed (inspect code [here](https://github.com/0xDigitalOil/nouns-props/tree/master/GeneralizedNFTDistributor)) a generalized version of the Nouns Vision Glasses distributor that allows for any proposer to propose random distribution of any ERC-721 in our Treasury to Nouners. This included development of a generalized version of the BatchTransfer contract [9999.⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/lastpunk9999) deployed for [Prop 185](https://nouns.wtf/vote/185).\n\nAs this deployment is not a one-off and meant to be a primitive the DAO can leverage at any time, plus the code is more complex, it requires more extensive testing. In addition, it requires a more complex custom front-end for the distribution claims.\n\n## Functional Distribution\n\nThe generalized NFT distributor has a new distribution mechanism baked in that allows the proposer to set the maximum number of NFTs to distribute. Then, if the prop passes, at execution time, the distribution contract calculates the number of NFTs to randomly distribute as a function of the vote (for, against, abstain) counts.\n\nThe proposer also selects the distribution amount calculation mechanism. This code extract shows the possible distribution rules the proposer can select from:\n\n![Proposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.](https://i.ibb.co/Gthy2Nj/Untitled.png)\n\nProposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.\n\nFor example, the proposer might want to propose a distribution of some LilNouns in the treasury. The proposer is unsure of how many LilNouns the DAO is willing to distribute so he/she selects VotesFor as the distribution mechanism. Thus, the higher “For Vote” turnout (the more popular the prop was), the more LilNouns will be distributed. \n\n## Prop Execution\n\nHere’s how proposing and execution works:\n\n![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/nn33yHB/Untitled-1.png)\n\n# Phase 2: Functional Funding\n\nI call “functional props” proposals that are self-referential at prop execution time. Initially I’m interested in exploring props that use vote counts (i.e., how many for/against/abstain) as inputs and take actions as a function of those inputs. We could imagine going beyond that to enable props that pull from a larger voter input-space such as vote reasons*.\n\nFunctional funding is a subset of functional props that enables an efficient way for the DAO to price proposals. The mechanism works as follows:\n\n1. Proposer writes a prop where he/she proposes to do some work for Nouns DAO.\n2. The proposer sets the prop transaction to call the FunctionalFunding contract and selects a funding range (e.g. 30-50 ETH) and distribution rule. This signals to the DAO that he/she is willing to do the work for a minimum of 30 ETH, but if the DAO as a whole signals that it values the work being done greatly (via strong FOR support), the proposer will get funded more than 30 ETH, up to 50 ETH.\n3. If the prop passes, when it executes it references itself, reading its vote counts to determine the funding amount according to the distribution rule.\n4. FunctionalFunding contract sends the calculated amount of ETH.\n\n![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/bgPmDV1/Untitled-2.png)\n\n## What does this solve?\n\nFor Proposers:\n\n- Allows the proposer to do an all-in-one price discovery by “polling” all voters on-chain\n- Lower probability of good proposals being rejected due to mere price → avoids going back, adjusting price and resubmitting\n\nFor Voters:\n\n- Decision is less stressful as it’s less binary. You can be OK with the prop content and range and “delegate” price decision to the rest of the voters\n\nFor Nouns DAO:\n\n- All-in-one prop voting and efficient price discovery\n- Proposals are more likely to be funded closer to “fair price” than the current binary funding mechanism\n\n# Deliverables\n\n1. Trustless, immutable primitive contract-set that allow Nouners to propose random distribution of NFTs, where the final number of NFTs distributed is a function of proposal popularity.\n2. Front-end for claiming NFTs of said distribution rounds. Allows for multiple distribution rounds per NFT collection.\n3. Trustless, immutable primitive contract that allow Nouners to create proposals that are funded within a range as a function of proposal popularity.\n\n# Ask\n\n35 ETH sent to me, [DigitalOil](https://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil). \n\nIf only I could propose a functional funding range 🤷‍♂️.\n\n### Funding breakdown\n\n1. 15 ETH — finish testing of NFT Distributor contracts. Develop generalized claim front-end.\n2. 20 ETH — Develop functional funding contract, including contract audit.\n\n*Note that using vote reasons as inputs to functional props would require a change to the governance contract as vote reasons are currently not introspectable at execution time."},{"blockNumber":16629618,"blockHash":"0x90c5a39a669fd80d3bb588db3c649e8ed28ee56e8e615e1df84b4beaf8cf32fc","transactionIndex":186,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x7fc0686b75c4bd84cc03c5d3c8acf618c885205a996c34e5ed81e14fb03d66a2","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":239,"proposer":"0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)",""],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000004b4a63e170aac970f45522fb6669a6f268cd672f00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000022ecb25c00","0x"],"startBlock":16665618,"endBlock":16701618,"description":"# Purchase 5000 copies x 6 issues of ‘Nouns: Nountown’ for hodl & distribution by NounsDAO\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TeIUlxa.png)\n\n‘Nouns: Nountown’ will be released in April of 2023, but the size of the print run will be determined by aggregate demand at the end of February.

These are the two largest events in comics, and we will bring copies of ‘Nouns: Nountown’ for the artist to sign at the convention, as well as copies to sell at the convention.\n\nNounsDAO (via ComicsDAO) will be able to accept orders through Titan Comics for fulfilment around the world, and ComicsDAO will set up an e-mail address for those that wish to use ETH or USDC to purchase books, with the proceeds going back into the Nouns Treasury as the comics are sold. Anyone that wants a book will be able to get one (until the stock is depleted).\n\nTerms\n\nEach issue is $5 USD, with 5,000 copies costing $25,000 USD. For 6 issues, that’s $150,000 USD, paid in USDC. Funds will be sent to the ComicsDAO/SharkDAO multisig from Prop 116.\n\nMultisig Address:\n0x4B4a63E170aAC970f45522fB6669a6f268CD672F\n"},{"blockNumber":16686423,"blockHash":"0xf01cd37b850cfee1d7ce45eacaa0c89c70ad0d5ff5a327c9e1e11d56df1d1ae6","transactionIndex":160,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x522cab26682cfed5d3cb6d3dcac322304034f88e46d6d3af53e6c33e542223cc","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":240,"proposer":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","targets":["0xa913F06D0b1cc9616CCe9646A9764bB46383f4d4"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":16722423,"endBlock":16758423,"description":"# Nounish Dataverse, open source data\n\n**TLDR**: Aggregating and organizing data from  applications, and making it open source and composable. The aggregated data will be published in a decentralized database and accessible through a GraphQL API.\n\n**Goal**: Our goal is to make it easier for people to use and control their data in the Nouniverse. We'll use [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/) and decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to achieve this, allowing data to flow more easily between different applications in the network. This will help solve issues with scattered/fragmented data and make it more easily available to everyone. We'll also establish a universal identity system to make it easier for different applications to share the same user account. Ultimately, we're working to create a reliable and efficient decentralized network that provides a better experience for users.\n\n![Qm-Toek-X1-Fsy-Dp-PXPn3mi-KPCns-VHy-Z6-H1-Pmka-A5qz4p-TVDj.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/T1Sn4xgM/Qm-Toek-X1-Fsy-Dp-PXPn3mi-KPCns-VHy-Z6-H1-Pmka-A5qz4p-TVDj.jpg)\n-   **What is the platform's function?** The platform can store and manage large amounts of data for decentralized protocols, allowing developers to easily create new applications that build upon existing data and contribute to the data graph.\n    \n- **What are the key benefits of the platform?** The platform enables innovative applications and user experiences, reduces data and application fragmentation, increases data sovereignty, facilitates integration and development, and improves interoperability and composability among participating applications.\n    \n-   **What problems are being addressed?** Universal identity, data and application fragmentation, data availability, and data composability.\n\n-   **Why can’t Ethereum be used to store the data?** “Ethereum itself can be used as a decentralized storage system, and it is when it comes to code storage in all the smart contracts. However, when it comes to large amounts of data, that isn't what Ethereum was designed for. The chain is steadily growing, but at the time of writing, the Ethereum chain is around 500GB - 1TB (depending on the client), and every node on the network needs to be able to store all of the data. If the chain were to expand to large amounts of data (say 5TBs) it wouldn't be feasible for all nodes to continue to run. Also, the cost of deploying this much data to Mainnet would be prohibitively expensive due to gas fees.” - [Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/bg/developers/docs/storage/)\n\n\n-   **Why is this platform preferable to IPFS, or similar solutions currently available in the market?**  We'll be using [ComposeDB](https://composedb.js.org/), which leverages Ceramic, a mutable layer for IPFS with anchoring on Ethereum for finality. By using Ceramic, the Nounish platform is able to provide faster data retrieval and processing, as well as advanced data management tools such as decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that enable greater control and ownership over data. \n\n- **Who are the team members?** **Baba**: 1 of 5 Nouns DAO Governance Prop House Mandate Winners, Datapod Co-Lead for Lil Nouns, Lil Nouns grants committee multi-sig signer. **Al409**: 2x Lil Noun DAO resident, and Agora Nouner Delegate Winner.  **Ripe, Volky**: Prop House Winners and BuilderDAO contributors. **Brunes, Champion Score**: Ex-Stripe, Ex-Google, and Nouns Governance Prop House Mandate Winners.\n\n## Problem Statement\nAs the DAO grows, people must navigate an environment that is increasingly fragmented. The data produced by many small and large applications are scattered, siloed and inconsistent in format and structure, making it difficult for users to access and utilize. This fragmentation lowers the accessibility, usability, and value of the data, and limits the potential insights and innovations that can be gained from it.\n\n  \n\nIn addition, only a small subset of all data in the Nouniverse is stored on-chain, which can create challenges for developers and users who need to access and use this data. In a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), data is a critical asset that drives decision-making, governance, and value creation. Therefore, it is important for a DAO to have a decentralized data network like Ceramic that provides users with greater control and ownership of their data, and enables interoperability and composability of data across different applications, including off-chain data.\n\n  \n**Vision**: In a future wherein permissionless data collaboration achieves critical mass within the DAO, users would have unprecedented control and ownership over their data, with the ability to easily share and reuse it across different participating applications. The decentralized nature of Ceramic would ensure that data is stored securely and efficiently, without the risk of censorship or centralization. The interoperability and composability enabled by Ceramic would lead to a proliferation of innovative and user-centric applications, breaking down the barriers that currently exist between different platforms and ecosystems. The benefits of this future would extend beyond just the technical members of the DAO, as all users would be able to take advantage of the seamless and intuitive interfaces enabled by the data network. The adoption of Ceramic would be a major step towards a more open and equitable internet, where data is treated as a commons to be shared and nurtured, rather than a commodity to be monetized and controlled.\n\n![Qm-Vda-PMMMe-Sj1-J6-RSeuizx-N1u-Bq-LAPc-N1f-G9phu-Uuv-Bk-Wb.png](https://i.postimg.cc/KzWKZNzt/Qm-Vda-PMMMe-Sj1-J6-RSeuizx-N1u-Bq-LAPc-N1f-G9phu-Uuv-Bk-Wb.png)\n\n## Objectives\n-   To create a decentralized data network and database that can make it easier for people to access, understand and use data in the Nouniverse.\n-   To give people more control and ownership over their data through the use of decentralized identifiers (DIDs).\n-   To make it possible for different applications to share and use data, creating new possibilities for how data can be used.\n-   To provide developers with access to a permissionless data layer, which includes information on governance, funding, and user activity for the DAO.\n-   To make it easy for developers to integrate with and build on top of the data that the DAO has collected.\n-   To enable developers to tap into the network effects of the DAO by allowing their applications to connect and interact with each other.\n-   To enable a more open and equitable internet where data is treated as a shared resource rather than a commodity that can be controlled and monetized.\n\n## Deliverables - 3 Month Timeline\nTo achieve these objectives, we will deliver the following components: infrastructure, applications, and services.\n\n**Infrastructure**: The infrastructure component involves deploying a Ceramic network node that runs an instance of ComposeDB, a decentralized, composable graph database. This node will serve the applications, which can read and write data permissionlessly (subject to data ownership constraints). The raw data backing this database is stored in IPFS. In order to bootstrap application use cases, relevant on-chain and off-chain data will be imported, processed and stored into ComposeDB. The data will be attributed with relationships for composability and made available via a GraphQL API.\n\n**Applications**: Three applications will be deployed on the Ceramic network by the core team upon completion.\n\n-   **NounsID** - The identity interface for the Nouniverse. A user profile for participants of the Nouns ecosystem, composed of user-owned properties and relationships to data from sources such as on-chain proposals and votes, PropHouse, Snapshot and Discourse. The user-owned profile allows the user to control their represented identity, linking it to social media accounts, setting up their preferences and carrying them across application built atop the decentralized data layer.\n    \n-   **Builder Profile** - Builder profiles (nounish cv) are meant to give a full picture of a nounish builder's contributions to the Nouniverse, leveraging data aggregated from NounID, stored on the decentralized data layer.\n    \n-   **Noundry** - Will integrate with the Ceramic network, leveraging its decentralized datastore, and our universal identity (NounsID). Noundry Ceramic Integration may include but are not limited by the following features:\n    \n    -  Upload your traits once, use it all across the ecosystem! - Create your artist profile and keep your own provenance records - Include metadata with your artwork. Give it name & context.\n    - Remix & collab on everything, powered by CC0 Some ideas of integrations to harness this data: \n    - Noundry contests, to sign up your traits and try to make them into official Nouns traits. \n    - Builder DAO, to boot a new DAO with Nounish artwork using a collection of existing traits. \n    - Noun DAO UIs, to show tooltips over the Nouns with more info about the traits and their artists\n    - Other features to explore: cross-dao artwork compatibility by mapping out trait categories, templates, sizes & color palettes - Scraping of existing artwork and contacting artists to seed their profiles - Offering the artwork in multiple formats (svg, png) for better compatibility with different applications\n\n\n**Services**: \n- Throughout development, the team will provide weekly Q&A during office hours, hosted by The Noun Square. \n- The team will provide a JavaScript library that makes it easy for front-end applications to query and deploy their own data. \n- Finally, we will collaborate with AI Pod, providing the processed and formatted data relevant for training their models.\n\n## Deliverables:\n**Infrastructure Component:**\n-   **Nounish decentralized database**: We'll run a Ceramic and ComposeDB node that serves the data through a GraphQL API.\n- **Scrape/ingest real Nouns data sources**: Collect PropHouse, on-chain, Snapshot and Discourse data in near real-time, so that apps can query and compose them through our service.\n- **Client library for easy integration**: Provide a JavaScript library that client applications can use to easily query and publish data.\n- **Nouner preferences:** Deploy a Preferred proposal categories, optional social links, preferred Noun profile image and other .\n- **Support and/or integrate with partners and application developers**: Work with the community to brainstorm on new and existing models and incorporate feedback.\n    \n>**Note**: Part of this work has been started with 15k USD subsidized by the Ceramic builder grants.\n\n\n**Application Component:**\n-   **1st Party, Core Applications:** NounsID\n- **3rd Party, Nounish Partner Integrations:** Noundry Integration and Builder Profile\n\n**Services Component:**\n-   Provide ingested, and formatted data for AI Pod\n-   Provide developers with APIs and a library to leverage permissionless, composable databases as a service.\n-   Q&A with developers during regularly scheduled office hours on The Noun Square.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n-   **Uptime**: Functional network with availability on-par with centralized databases.\n-   **Integrations**: Successful integration with launch partner - Noundry.\n-  **Composability**: One or more demonstrable (ideally novel) composable and interoperable application use cases from pre-existing applications in the Nouns ecosystem.\n-   **Partnerships**: Number of pre-existing nounish applications that commit, and follow through with network integrations in the ecosystem that leverage the network.\n- **Data Sources**: Amount of data sources integrated, and CRUD operations executed on Ceramic.\n\n## Future Work\n\n-   Expand data sources to eventually include all relevant data generated in the Nouniverse and make it permissionless and composable, along with publishing relevant metadata from applications running on the network.\n-   Create developer tools, documentation, and examples to make development easier for developers.\n-   Partnerships: Coordinate with Voters.wtf, Federation, Lil Nouns mainsite, and Apache SuperSet(Nouns Metrics), for potential network integration.\n\n## Team Structure & Budget\n\n- **Infrastructure, NounsID development:** \n    - Brunes: 7.75 ETH/Month\n    - Champion Score: 7.5 ETH/Month\n- **Technical Program & Partnership Management:** \n    -  Al409: 3 ETH/Month\n    -  Baba: 7 ETH/Month \n- **Integration Partners:** \n    - Volky: 3 ETH/Month\n    - Ripe: 3 ETH/Month\n- **Builder Grants**: ETH allocation to be used for Prop House rounds, and/or direct developer/builder integrations with Ceramic in order to bootstrap the network effects of our Nounish dataverse.

Finish development, testing and deploy a generalized NFT random distributor which enables any proposer to propose distribution of current or future NFTs in our Treasury. The distributor makes use of new tech I call “functional props”; meaning the prop itself determines how many NFTs to distribute at execution time as a function of the prop’s vote counts. `Now includes a Pull Request into the nouns.wtf front-end to allow for a better UX when proposing NFT distributions.`\n3. Develop, test, audit and deploy a contract that enables proposers to ask for functional funding. Functional funding allows proposers to suggest a funding range within which they are willing to execute a prop. The actual funding amount received is determined by the prop’s vote counts. `Now includes a Pull Request into the nouns.wtf front-end to allow for better UX when proposing range or milestone funding.`\n\n# Why Functional Props?\n\n*Cool tech, cool experiment. But how is it useful?*\n\n`Historically, all DAO proposals have had binary outcomes (pass or fail). The time has come to invent tooling for DAOs to allow for non-binary outcomes on votes, and for Nouns to lead the way on this.`\n\n`Take Prop 239 (comic book purchase) as an example. The DAO could be in agreement that it makes sense to purchase comic books, but not necessarily 5,000 of them. If the prop’s voting outcome were non-binary, the DAO would have had a way to simultaneously decide if it makes sense, and also how many comic books to print. Maybe the prop wouldn’t have had to be canceled.`\n\nFor both NFT distribution and funding it’s a more efficient way of achieving “middle ground”; a form of consensus.\n\nThink about it as a way of taking an on-chain average of all opinions.\n\nThe current alternative is an attention-deprived off-chain back and forth between proponent and community to arrive at a proposal price point or distribution number.\n\n# `Past props where functional props would have been useful`\n\n`Prop 236: Wizard’s Hat — determine the mint price of our NFT together at vote time, from a range.`\n\n`Prop 223: House of Nouns — Implement milestones instead of all or nothing.  Milestones are mapped to voting tiers. The more popular the prop is at vote time, more funding is sent and more features get implemented.`\n\n`Prop 217: Stake an additional 5,000 ETH in LIDO — instead stake between 1,000-5,000 depending on the level of support for the prop.`\n\n`Prop 206: Nouns on the Ground 2023 — Do tiered funding (5, 10, or 15 IRL events) instead of all or nothing.`\n\n`Prop 202: nouns.eth set reverse record — in addition to executing, do we also send 1 ETH to Jacob? Depending on the popularity of the prop, we send between 0-1ETH.`\n\n`Prop 184: Nouns funding ZachXBT — fund within range 50-100 ETH, instead of all or nothing.`\n\n`Prop 167: Nouns Builder — seed the Builder treasury within a range (e.g. 500-1,000 ETH).`\n\n`Prop 125: 8/8 anniversary art — only change existing traits if the vote is unanimous.*`\n\n# `Answers to common doubts on functional funding`\n\n### `What if a proposer that is willing to do work for 30 ETH proposes a range of 30-50 ETH to squeeze out more from the DAO?`\n\n`A proposer is disincentivized to do so, as it increases the likelihood of the prop being defeated. It could also be argued conversely, that if functional funding wasn’t possible, the proposer could have proposed an all-or-nothing 50 ETH instead of a range where the DAO could save money if the prop passes, but barely. We can’t be certain if functional funding will make overall payouts larger or smaller, but we can be sure that funds will be allocated more efficiently as more granularity allows for concentrating capital where it needs to be.`\n\n### `If I support a proposal getting the lower part of the range, but not the upper part, how am I supposed to decide how to vote before the very last second?`\n\n`Granted that this is a tricky aspect of functional funding. I give a two-part answer:`\n\n`1. The question doesn’t apply to all props where functional funding could be useful. For example, take the hypothetical use for Prop 217 (staking in LIDO). If you are OK with staking 5,000 ETH, you are OK with staking 1,000. In this case, you it doesn’t really matter to you if you vote early or later. If you aren’t comfortable with staking up to 5,000 ETH, you vote against. You would have voted against Prop 217 in its non-functional funding incarnation anyway.`\n`2. Granted that those who vote later have more information than those who vote earlier. However, those that vote earlier likely are OK with the entire range. Those that vote later will have more influence over the outcome. This is a net positive: a. those who are OK with the entire range are happy. b. those who want to control the range, can do so by voting later.`\n\n### `Even though the tech is innovative, I don’t see it being widely adopted`\n\n`Refer to the section above where I highlight some use cases that make Nouns a more agile decision-making DAO.`\n\n### `The main mechanics of the DAO should stick to the KISS principle`\n\n`The concern is that it should be made as simple as possible for Nouners to vote. I agree that simpler is better. Most props will not make use of functional funding and will stick to KISS. However, for those that it makes sense to make outcomes functional, if it’s more efficient for the DAO, it’s worth the marginal complexity.`\n\n# Phase 1: Generalized NFT Distributor\n\nBefore functional funding comes functional NFT distribution.\n\nI am the dev and proposer behind [Prop 199](https://nouns.wtf/vote/199) which passed 226 : 9. Prop 199 was a successful experiment to distribute 50 Nouns Vision Glasses from our Treasury to Nouners at random.\n\nI have developed (inspect code [here](https://github.com/0xDigitalOil/nouns-props/tree/master/GeneralizedNFTDistributor)) a generalized version of the Nouns Vision Glasses distributor that allows for any proposer to propose random distribution of any ERC-721 in our Treasury to Nouners. This included development of a generalized version of the BatchTransfer contract [9999.⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/lastpunk9999) deployed for [Prop 185](https://nouns.wtf/vote/185).\n\nAs this deployment is not a one-off and meant to be a primitive the DAO can leverage at any time, plus the code is more complex, it requires more extensive testing. In addition, it requires a more complex custom front-end for the distribution claims.\n\n## `Why do we need a generalized NFT distributor?`\n\n`The Nouns DAO treasury continues to hoard NFTs as subDAOs such as Lil Nouns and Nouns Builder are “paying backwards” in the form of governance tokens.`\n\n`It is likely that as the Nouns meme proliferates, more and more subDAOs will continue to do the same.`\n\n`Historically, we haven’t used these NFTs to govern these subDAOs and to this date haven’t reached consensus as to whether it’s something we are interested in doing as a DAO.`\n\n`There is no point in having NFTs in our treasury that we don’t plan on using. If we are to go down the alternate path, who better than Nouners to receive them and participate in subDAO governance in an individual, more decentralized manner.`\n\n## Functional Distribution\n\nThe generalized NFT distributor has a new distribution mechanism baked in that allows the proposer to set the maximum number of NFTs to distribute. Then, if the prop passes, at execution time, the distribution contract calculates the number of NFTs to randomly distribute as a function of the vote (for, against, abstain) counts.\n\nThe proposer also selects the distribution amount calculation mechanism. This code extract shows the possible distribution rules the proposer can select from:\n\n![Proposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.](https://i.ibb.co/Gthy2Nj/Untitled.png)\n\nProposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.\n\nFor example, the proposer might want to propose a distribution of some LilNouns in the treasury. The proposer is unsure of how many LilNouns the DAO is willing to distribute so he/she selects VotesFor as the distribution mechanism. Thus, the higher “For Vote” turnout (the more popular the prop was), the more LilNouns will be distributed. \n\n## Prop Execution\n\nHere’s how proposing and execution works:\n\n![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/nn33yHB/Untitled-1.png)\n\n# Phase 2: Functional Funding\n\nI call “functional props” proposals that are self-referential at prop execution time. Initially I’m interested in exploring props that use vote counts (i.e., how many for/against/abstain) as inputs and take actions as a function of those inputs. We could imagine going beyond that to enable props that pull from a larger voter input-space such as vote reasons*.\n\nFunctional funding is a subset of functional props that enables an efficient way for the DAO to price proposals. The mechanism works as follows:\n\n1. Proposer writes a prop where he/she proposes to do some work for Nouns DAO.\n2. The proposer sets the prop transaction to call the FunctionalFunding contract and selects a funding range (e.g. 30-50 ETH) and distribution rule. This signals to the DAO that he/she is willing to do the work for a minimum of 30 ETH, but if the DAO as a whole signals that it values the work being done greatly (via strong FOR support), the proposer will get funded more than 30 ETH, up to 50 ETH.\n3. If the prop passes, when it executes it references itself, reading its vote counts to determine the funding amount according to the distribution rule.\n4. FunctionalFunding contract sends the calculated amount of ETH.\n\n![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/bgPmDV1/Untitled-2.png)\n\n## What does this solve?\n\nFor Proposers:\n\n- Allows the proposer to do an all-in-one price discovery by “polling” all voters on-chain\n- Lower probability of good proposals being rejected due to mere price → avoids going back, adjusting price and resubmitting\n\nFor Voters:\n\n- Decision is less stressful as it’s less binary. You can be OK with the prop content and range and “delegate” decision of the price point to the rest of the voters\n\nFor Nouns DAO:\n\n- All-in-one prop voting and efficient price discovery\n- Proposals are more likely to be funded closer to “fair price” than the current binary funding mechanism\n- `For the first time, allows the DAO to vote on proposals that need to pass unanimously to execute`\n\n# Deliverables\n\n1. Trustless, immutable primitive contract-set that allow Nouners to propose random distribution of NFTs, where the final number of NFTs distributed is a function of proposal popularity.\n2. Front-end for claiming NFTs of said distribution rounds. Allows for multiple distribution rounds per NFT collection.\n3. Trustless, immutable primitive contract that allow Nouners to create proposals that are funded within a range as a function of proposal popularity.\n4. `UI on [nouns.wtf](http://nouns.wtf) similar to the USDC converter, that allows proposers to select and input parameters for functional NFT distributions or funding.`\n\n# `Positive feedback on Prop 238`\n\n**`The innovative approach to Human Organization presented here is a promising addition to the Nouns toolkit, which continues to lead the way with innovative public goods. I support the continued exploration of fresh governance approaches, such as the \"Function Props\" concept, which can leverage the benefits of large group decision-making.`**\n\n**`I'm in favor of experimenting to find better mechanisms we can use to reach non-binary outcomes for proposals and for that reason I'm voting in favor. Even if this isn't used much or is used and we discover what the shortcoming is, that would be a plus in my book.`**\n\n**`I think that it is important for the DAO to continue to explore new ways to use governance to resolve conflict, and I see \"Function Props\" as a promising direction here. They could offer a way to take advantage of the concave decision making advantage of large groups: where any point along the spectrum from 0 to 1 is higher value than either a 0 or 1 outcome.`**\n\n**`innovative price discovery`**\n\n**`Great way to put the NFTs in the treasury to work!`**\n\n**`Sounds like this can be implemented, so I'm in full support. More than reasonable cost.`**\n\n**`Digitaloil is demonstrably dedicated, creative and aligned with Nouns long term and wants to try and build a useful Nounish primitive.  Let's see how he impresses.`**\n\n**`i think the cost is fair, and it could also lead to new ideas to improve or offer alternatives to the current proposal constraints.`**\n\n**`Nounish dev building nounish things - hopefully having funding methods like this save the dao money in the long term`**\n\n**`nounishly positive`**\n\n**`The range funding is the killer app here imo.

Our goal is to expand House of Nouns from an MVP for voting into a full suite of tools that enables proposers and voters with an ideas board, drafts, feedback, Nounish integrations, and more places for discussion.\n\nMost importantly: We will open source the end product, so anyone can host, build on top of, and monetize the deliverables in this proposal. Nouns will have permanent access to House of Nouns via the open source infrastructure.\n\n*This is our third and final revision for House of Nouns. We have reduced the original budget by ~60% in USD, from 340 ETH ($420,000) to 95 ETH ($160,000).

This creates public infrastructure for DAO governance that can be used by anyone, forever, funded by Nouns.\n\nAdditionally, there is no centralized value capture for [Collective](https://twitter.com/collectivexyz) (the company building House of Nouns) or anyone else. Anyone and everyone can build on top of it.\n\nWe believe the open-source, permissionless approach is inline with the ethos of Nouns, versus the alternative of closed-source, licensing of the product, subscriptions, or advertising.\n\n# With 20 ETH from Prop House, we’ve…\n- Created an MVP used by ~26% of Nouns (incl. holders, proposers, & delegates)\n- Over 100% month-over-month growth (MAUs & views)\n- Fostered proposal discussion that is nowhere else\n- Become a go-to client for voting and discussion\n\n# Deliverables\nThese are the deliverables we’ll guarantee to build over the next five months. We move quickly, and we’re excited to go above-and-beyond where applicable.\n\n### Pre-proposal Drafts Client\n- Goal: Makes the pre-proposal process public and collaborative.\n- Proposal drafts & versions, saving time with tedious markdown editing & feedback\n- Proposal templates \n- Inline commenting with ETH identities \n- Public revisions \n- One-click promote to onchain \n\n### Ideas Client\n- Goal: Post early stage ideas, generate support, and promote to a draft.\n- Reddit-like platform for voting on ideas\n- Upvoting and commenting tied to ETH identities\n- One-click promote to draft or “looking for sponsor”\n\n### Open-source Infrastructure\n- Goal: Eliminate barriers to building on Nouns governance, and allow anyone to self-host \n- API for all governance, discussion, profiles, etc.\n- Open source repository\n- Technical docs\n\n### Public good for all Nounish DAOs\n- Feed for activity across your DAOs\n- See to-dos and notifications across DAOs\n- Support for all Nouns forks\n\n### Integration of Nounish tools\n- We will use building blocks from the Nouns ecosystem where possible\n- Some ideas include but are not limited to: \n- Prop House voting \n- Agora delegate profiles\n- Federation DAO-to-DAO governance\n- Nouns AI pod summaries & context\n- Nouns Atlas search\n\n# Budget\nWe’re requesting **95 ETH for 5 months** for full-time development work from a team of four developers — or ~5 ETH/developer/month. After revising our proposal and speaking with numerous members of the community, we believe this is fair and in line with standard service development costs.\n\nWe believe this budget is easily justified for deliverables that will positively impact decentralization, participation, and decision-making.\n\n# Team\n- [dadkins](https://twitter.com/dadkins_): longtime crypto hacker\n- [Wojciech Kocjan](https://twitter.com/w_kocjan): frontend & design engineer\n- Jamal Hashim: ex-Amazon, blockchain engineer\n- John Cairns: longtime crypto builder, ex-Gemini\n\nThis is a condensed version of the proposal.

When this content is pieced together retroactively - all of the cinematic content will be able to be binged as a single movie / series. Atrium creatives will write and create the content which will be split up among story acts.\n\nThis specific prop is funding a pilot delivered at the end of 90 days. Detailed below are the steps involved in exploring different visual styles, additional deliverables and ultimately making the Pilot content. \n\nAfter the pilot is revealed in 90 days, the DAO will decide if it wants to move forward in funding more of the whole film.\n\n---\n### Proposal Ask:\n**125,000 USD for a time-period of 90 days**\n\n- Pre-production & character development\n- Script for the Pilot (3.5 mins) / ACT 1 + Summaries of all subsequent acts - delivered at 90 days\n- Animated Teaser with final look for the show - delivered at 45 days \n- Animated Pilot (Runtime 3.5 mins) with the above mentioned script - delivered at 90 days\n\n*transferred to Atrium Multi-sig upon execution*\n\n---\n\nNote: *Subsequent funding pathway for future Acts as detailed below with the rough timeline*. As we go further along the production (optional and will come in different proposals), the timeline gets more efficient and shrinks.\n\n\n\n### Recap: what is Atrium?\nAtrium.art is a crypto-native network of independent artists and creators. Disciplines represented on Atrium currently include Screenwriting, Animation, Concept Art, Voice Actors, and Music production. Together, creatives on Atrium bring experience from Pixar, Marvel, Luma Pictures, Sony, Netflix and many more.\nYou can see the work of Artists on Atrium [here](https://atrium.art/)\nSimply put, Atrium is a way to easily piece together veteran talent to produce cinematic content.\n\n\n### Resident Atrium Team\nMain Creative leads:\n\n[Zendoubt](https://zendoubt.art/) (Creative Director) - Black Panther, Godzilla vs Kong, Thor Ragnarok, Birds of Prey\n![](https://i.imgur.com/opKf6Pr.jpg)\n\n[HKJay](https://hkjay.com/) (Creative Director) - The Sea Beast, Lego Movies, Peter Rabbit, His Dark materials\n![](https://i.imgur.com/F5KrKIg.png)\n\n[3dprintguy](https://atrium.art/artist/3d-print-guy) (Executive Producer)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rmzvlQT.jpg)\n\nWriting Lead :\n[William Yu](https://twitter.com/its_willyu) - BlckList 2021 , Created [#starringjohncho](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-36253081) campaign\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p5x3DE2.png)\n\nExternal Studio Partner (tentative)\nhttps://meta-ent.com/meta/ - Creators of Riri, [Mave: Pandora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wGOHbcQKIc)\n\nIn addition we are assembling a veteran team of creatives (10-14) associating with an external studio partner who will help set up a dedicated production pipeline to handle the needed throughput of the content. This alongside Atrium core will be entirely remote first so it will be the first non-trivial budget content workflow at this scale being funded by nouns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UVaImTv.png)\n\nAdditionally Atrium will be sourcing Voice Over Artists, Sound Design resources for \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9iJ30qE.png)\n\n\n---\n\n### Scope of this proposal (Detailed view)\n*An elaborate pre-production stage is crucial in order to explore the style and feel of a large production before locking / committing to it for the entire duration. These early steps of engagement and experimentation allow us to save time and money by avoiding costly redesigns later.* \n\nDuring Prop 195, While we created a unique and upbeat version of Nountown with character design that were standard, exploring uniqueness with heads and attire; We realised that there was scope to also explore pathways to develop a style framework that introduces : \n- More personality via body types\n- Introduce unique worlds beyond nountown\n\n#### Pre-production\n##### Animation Tests done in public\nThis early stage style exploration allows us to converge on something that will feel coherent and appropriate for the larger production. \n\nAn example of this pre-production work is a screen test done by Sony Animation for a feature length Popeye film: https://youtu.be/M1lzJuwJD9k?t=122\nWhilst this screen test is much more elaborate and polished than we intend, Sony would have done many smaller ones leading up to this very polished result which they were proud to make public.\n\nBy doing an animation screen test we can experiment with different looks in order to find the right one. This can also serve as future reference for other Nouns animated content, as different possible “looks”.\n\nUnlike Sony Animation, we have the advantage of building in the public eye, giving a rare glimpse into the animation process as well as giving the community a chance to share their sentiment prior to committing to a style..\n\n##### Looks Tests done in public\nThe designs, the texturing and lighting of the world. Does the world feel more clean or is it more grungy like stop motion, E.G. Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio. There are many possibilities to explore. Here are just a few examples.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fXr0zYd.jpg)\n\n#### Deliverable #1 : (45 days mark)\nScreen tests in different looks + a teaser trailer for the Pilot Episode to come at 90 days mark. \n\n#### Story\nThe future of this cinematic story creation begins with a pilot screenplay, but will expand throughout subsequent acts in a way that allows for adults, teens, and kids to find something relatable within the world that is created. \nThe foundations of existing Nounish stories (prop 70, prop 116) will serve as a guide for cultural relevance and overall thematic inspiration for the story but will be unique in its own right. Unlike standard film productions, our build in public stance detailed below will invite the community to experience the magic of production first hand.\n\n#### Building in Public\n- We will be setting up a dedicated corner on the Atrium Server and sharing progress on socials for people to follow-along with the creative process. We plan to release regular media updates and share sneak peeks.\n\n- Anyone inside and outside the Nouns community is welcome to join. Most channels will be open to Public while some production related channels will be private to have agility on creative decisions. \n\n- We will host multiple open town halls with Creatives & the community members to hear ideas and keep the community updated on the process and progress.\n\n- *Casting Calls Galore:* As the Story is being written, we will be introducing an interactive exercise to do casting calls from the nounish community, where we make the picks on the main and auxiliary characters from the submitted / interested community members from nouns DAO and sub DAOs.\n\n- Behind the scenes videos and animation technicals to be produced alongside the content and be distributed after the premiere happens in between the premiere.\n\n#### Deliverable #2 : (90 days mark)\nPilot Episodic premiering on all socials and a Drop Proposal.\n\n#### Ask Summary Recap\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NgL4vbW.png)\n\n----\n### Future Funding Roadmap & Breakdown\n\n*Note: This is optional and only shared as a future roadmap. This is NOT part of this specific proposal scope and will be subjected to their own evaluation parameters.*\n\nIt’s a first of its kind, large production endeavour which attempts to break-free from legacy content production models and Nouns DAO is at the precipice of being the only few who can enable this. When you look at traditional animated film funding today, they can range from micro budgets (Less than 1M USDC) to Jumbo budgets (200M+), and the bulk is paid for [star actors](https://www.cartoonbrew.com/artist-rights/steve-carell-minions-12-5-million-dollars-219015.html), studio supervisors, and executives. Tangled (with a whopping 260M production cost) was one of the costliest animated features made.\n\nAs we are aware, many times it is normal for incredible artists to drown out and be siloed in suboptimal work culture and long hours in the animation industry, alongside their creative input. Offering budgets that can be competitive while retaining a much higher degree of creative autonomy (in absence of network executives) , we can give them the financial security to leave a traditional studio structure and be part of a long-term vision which seeks to upend the narrative. \n\nAll the team members defined in this proposal already have shown full commitment to come onboard if this series of proposals kicks off and embark on creating one of the highest quality production value the crypto space has seen till date. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5R6YDTS.png)\n\nThis continues till Act 22 and 77 mins total including the pilot (3.5 mins). It runs for 550+ days if funded all the way.\n\n\n### Past Funding from the DAO\n3dprintguy at Atrium was funded for 20 ETH via [Prop 195](https://nouns.wtf/vote/237) and created a standalone animated short film.

There are 3 statuses a funded proposal might have: completed, in progress, or rugged. As a DAO we should have a clear understanding of the status of all proposals, information related to the progress, and proof of completion which also acts as an easy way for the community to see the end result of a proposal.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe solution for this is the Nouns Proposal Tracker which acts like a wiki for funded proposals.\n\nThis platform tracks funded proposals in real time and allows Noun holders, delegates, and proposal owners to add information about a funded proposal such as the status, progress logs, proof of completion, and comments. \n\nProposals can be sorted by their status to easily give an overview of how many and what types of proposals were completed, or are in progress and how many proposers rugged the DAO.\n\nBy getting a glimpse of potential rugs we can also try to follow-up with the owners of rugged proposals to see if there is a chance to have the work completed. If there is not it's important that these people are held accountable in some way.\n\n## Nouner and Delegate Permissions\n\nNouners and their delegates will be able to modify the status of proposals, add comments/questions, and add proof of completion. Any nouner or delegate can modify the status at any time. \n\n## Proposal Owner Permissions\n\nWallets that submitted proposals have the same permissions as nouners and delegates. They can also add additional wallets which can post on a specific proposal. In addition to the Nouner/delegate permissions proposal owners and their admin wallets can add progress logs. These logs can detail the progress of a given proposal.\n\n## Open-sourced\n\nAll code will be open-sourced for others to fork, build upon, or improve. Repo will have README file the includes instructions on how to run the project locally and contribute to the code base. \n\n## Adding to Nouns Frontend\n\nI can submit a pull request into the Nouns front end repo to add a link to this platform on the DAO page so it can be easily found. We can highlight its uses for those submitting proposals. \n\n## Team \n\nDeployer\n\nOwner of Noun 375 and 609. I am a serial builder and have been building in the NFT space since 2017. I authored ERC2309 which is an ethereum standard allowing for the efficient tracking of a large amount of NFTs across platforms. I built an early NFT platform, called Cargo, which included multi chain minting tools, asset management, a robust JS library, and marketplace that securely processed 10s of millions of dollars worth of transactions.\n\nAs of late I am building the Heroes ecosystem. Heroes started as a CC0 NFT project which stored character stats and traits on chain for people to build upon. The core team is now building a robust web3 powered, free to play game in the spirit of open world building, CC0, and collaboration.\n\nRelated to Nouns I did the frontend and backend development of the Noun O'clock App as part of the Nouns Client prop house.\n\n**Timeline**\n3 months \n\n**Funding ask**\n30 ETH - Development\n3 ETH - 1 year infrastructure costs\n\nTotal 33 ETH"},{"blockNumber":16781485,"blockHash":"0x151b7e7c108989dd942dc19336891b9054f653f79c3cd60f276b25d45250db24","transactionIndex":136,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x5d7606db546c22d720d1ee20fe7c25dd7d36724081b3c63e8f8c1464a937ff3d","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":247,"proposer":"0x046C54a8c88397C9b222B979f7B6eFE9077f4bDe","targets":["0xae7ab96520DE3A18E5e111B5EaAb095312D7fE84","0x95852813766e4A3112891FE6a47100023D61e5a4"],"signatures":["transfer(address,uint256)","extendDeadline(uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x00000000000000000000000095852813766e4a3112891fe6a47100023d61e5a40000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000c72afe0e5051280000","0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000642cdbbf"],"startBlock":16817485,"endBlock":16853485,"description":"# Rage Quit\n\n\n# Rage Quit\n\n**Rage Quit Contract**: `0x95852813766e4A3112891FE6a47100023D61e5a4`\n\n### Summary\n\nRQ has been a topic discussed many times but hasn't been actually implemented. With a growing number of disgruntled members of this DAO, rage quit should have been an option a long time ago. Thank you to all members who have delegated their votes to me.\n\nThe primary argument that prevented RQ was that RQ somehow makes Nouns a security and holds the DAO liable for breaking SEC laws. This is quite flawed as the DAO already operates in grey waters in relation to SEC regulations. \n\n- The DAO has already acted as seed investors in proposals and mimics an investment syndicate.\n- Nouns are essentially class A shares for an entity with a large treasury.\n- A large portion of the treasury is in stETH which is an active area of discussion of whether it is a security or not.\n\nIf someone wanted to argue that NounsDAO breaks securities laws, they would have already done so, adding rage quit does not *suddenly* make Nouns a security.\n\n### Rage Quit Details\n\nThis implementation is the simplest form of RQ (the contract is only ~100 lines minus comments), we didn’t want to add any smart contract complications. The flow goes as follows:\n\n1. The treasury will fund the RQ contract in rounds. Round 1 will consist of 25% of the treasury (25% of the ETH and 25% of the stETH). If Round 1 is fully claimed (25% of Nouns have rage quit), another RQ proposal to fund Round 2 will be submitted to fund another 25% (and so on and so on). The reasoning for rounds is that we don’t want to handicap the DAO by taking custody of all funds while RQ is in process.\n\n2. Round 1 will be active for 2 weeks, during that time, holders that wish to ragequit will transfer their Nouns to the RQ contract and receive their book value of the treasury. The reason we lock Nouns into the contract versus burn Nouns is because only the DAO has the permissions to burn Nouns, thus, the DAO can retrieve all Nouns from the contract at any point.\n\n3. In the case there are funds left in the RQ contract after the deadline (no more people want to rage quit), the DAO can take back all remaining funds.\n\n4. Only Nouns up to `Noun #634` (the last noun before this proposal) **will be eligible for RQ**. This is to prevent new bidders from attempting to arbitrage new Nouns that get auctioned until the prop passes/fails. We are aware that there are Nouns on secondary (currently 12) that may be arbed against the treasury but the way we look at it, these Nouns will be used to get RFV from the treasury regardless. The Nouns selling on secondary below RFV will either be delisted and claimed for RFV or someone will buy the Noun and *potentially* claim for RFV. Thus, the treasury doesn’t gain more rage quitters from the Nouns on secondary (at the very best people that buy don't rage quit).\n\n**The current book value for each Nouns is calculated as follows:**\n\nETH book value for 1 Noun is `19 ETH`. This is the treasuries ETH balance **rounded down** with a 5% rage quit fee, the total is also rounded down - `floor(13144 eth / 634 * 0.95)`.\n\nStETH book value for 1 Noun is `22 ETH`. This is the treasuries StETH balance **rounded down** with a 5% rage quit fee, the total is also rounded down - `floor(14764 eth / 634 * 0.95)`.\n\n### Review of the contract:\n\nMost of the variables are immutable constants as to prevent any malicious prop that may siphon more funds out of the treasury. **Please ensure these values are correct**\n\n```\n    // final nounID that was auctioned before prop was submitted\n    uint256 public constant FINAL_ELIGIBLE_NOUN = 634;\n\n    // this is the eth treasury balance (rounded down) divided by 634 with a 5% tax\n    // floor(13144 / 634 * 0.95)\n    uint256 public constant ETH_BOOK_VALUE = 19 ether;\n\n    // this is the steth treasury balance (rounded down) divided by 634 with a 5% tax\n    // floor(14764 / 634 * 0.95)\n    uint256 public constant STETH_BOOK_VALUE = 22 ether;\n\n    // proxy address\n    address public constant NOUNS_DAO =\n        0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d;\n\n    // nouns treasury address\n    address public constant NOUNS_TREASURY =\n        0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10;\n\n    // nouns token address\n    address public constant NOUNS_TOKEN =\n        0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03;\n\n    // stETH address\n    address public constant STETH = 0xae7ab96520DE3A18E5e111B5EaAb095312D7fE84;\n```\n\n`function extendDeadline(uint256 _claimDeadline) external`: **This function can only be called via prop by the DAO**.

It embodies a desire to contribute to the production and maintenance of a public good (in this case Ethereum’s decentralization) with the optimistic view that individuals’ independent judgment and actions [can make a difference](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1595793106926014466).\n\nHowever, solo staking, as the name suggests, can be quite lonely. So we wanted to help make it more fun by introducing a distinctly nounish playful & absurdist element: a nouns block graffiti prize pool.\n\n## How can you participate?\n\nIf you already have a staking setup, all you need to do is add “⌐◨-◨” to the graffiti flag of your consensus client.\n\nIf you aren’t yet a staker, but always wanted to and this prop is motivating you to stake some of your ETH, then that’s amazing and we’ll be rooting for you! \n\nThe easiest way to solo stake from home (in our opinion) is [buying an Intel NUC](https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1546302759439421440) (along with 2TB SSD and 32GB RAM chips) and setting up Dappnode, an open source node operator that helps you install and run Ethereum clients of your choice. You can also buy a ready-to-use staking node from [Dappnode’s store](https://dappnode.com/en-us/collections/frontpage) which makes it is even easier.\n\n## How will the prizes be paid out?\n\nThe prize ETH will initially be held in a multisig. At the end of each month, starting April, we will initiate a 10 ETH transaction to a smart contract (to be developed) that randomly selects 10 winners amongst a list of candidate validator addresses.\n\nWe’ll use the following options as the validator's address (in this order): A) validator’s ENS (if included in the block graffiti), B) withdrawal address (if set by the validator), and C) the “from” address of the staking deposit transaction. \n\nThe spirit of this proposal is to celebrate and incentivize solo stakers. If we find that a large staking pool is attempting to ruin the fun, we’ll disclose those validators publicly on Twitter and not include them as potential prize candidates.\n\n## How can you follow along?\n\nWe’ll create a site that showcases the ⌐◨-◨ graffiti blocks etched into the Ethereum blockchain. We might also create a Twitter bot that tweets out whenever a new block with noggles is discovered.\n\n\n## Who are the volunteers running this program?\n\n[Noun 40](https://twitter.com/noun40__), [gregskril.eth](https://twitter.com/gregskril), and [Ripe](https://twitter.com/ripe0x).\n\n\n## Any additional resources for solo staking?\n\n* [How to stake on Ethereum](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/tvlnck/how_to_stake_on_ethereum_april_2022_edition/) — a bit outdated but still the best comprehensive writeup on eth staking by [superphiz](https://twitter.com/superphiz).\n* [Hardware for staking](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/rizos9/hardware_for_staking_2022_edition/) — a good run through of the hardware options by [Lamboshi](https://twitter.com/L_Nakaghini).\n* Ethstaker — a [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/) and [discord](http://discord.io/ethstaker) community of eth stakers where you can search for commonly asked questions and get help.\n* [Tweet thread](https://twitter.com/noun40__/status/1627009674603290624) of Noun 40 recently going through the whole process of solo saking from home. \n* [Client Diversity](https://clientdiversity.org/) — a site to check Ethereum’s current client diversity.

When we sat down to think about which internet community to pilot them for, the answer was obvious: Nouns.\n\nWe hope that through this work, we'll continue iterating on healthy discussions in the future internet together.\n\n## Primary deliverables\n\nWe'll deliver a hacker news/reddit-style website with two primary features for nouners (verified by ZKP as with heyanoun v1):\n1. persistent pseudonyms\n2. threaded pseudonymous discussions\n\n### threaded discussions\n\nHeyanoun v1 messages can't be replied to or held accountable. While we often see situations in which users broadcast a message effectively replying to a previously posted message, threading isn't explicit.\n\nIn v2, we plan to make it possible to reply to an arbitrary previous message, thus enabling arbitrary discussion trees to form. \n\nWe believe that this is crucial for re-engagement.\n\nWe'll build on the second idea briefly mentioned [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-simple-persistent-pseudonym-scheme/14930#extensions-10) to do so. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, we're designing a hacker news/reddit-style interface for creating new discussion points and commenting on old ones.\n\n### persistent pseudonyms\n\nHeyanoun v1 had no sense of persistence in user identity. Users post messages into the ether.\n\nWe believe that with some notion of persistent pseudonyms, we can enable more interesting pseudonymous conversations between nouners. Persistent pseudonyms also allow for simple mechanisms of reputation and content filtering.\n\nIt becomes possible, for example, to filter discussion to just those discussions involving a well-known pseudonym.\n\nAdditionally, nouners will be able to bring their pseudonyms anywhere on the internet; only a specific nouner can generate the proof corresponding to a specific pseudonym. \n\nAlthough we won't be designing for this initially, this portability means that these pseudonyms can be re-used in other internet venues, similar to an ENS name. \n\n### (rough) user flow\n\nWe imagine the following user flow (designs pending):\n- user generates proof of nouner-ship\n- user picks pseudonym to attach to message\n    - any pseudonym they've used before or a new one\n- user picks message in-thread to reply to\n\nIn this way, nouners add pseudonymous messages with pseudonyms attached to one big nounish, pseudonymous discussion tree.\n\n## Secondary deliverables\n\n### downstream consumption by API\n\nAs mentioned above, the resulting 'data artifact' produced is a tree of proofs, pseudonyms, and messages. \n\nWhile today, the main consumption methods for heyanoun messages are twitter/discord bots, we want to open the API such that any nounish downstream site can pull relevant heyanoun messages into their site. \n\n### integration with spartan-ecdsa and further proving improvements\n\nIn parallel with our work on heyanoun, we've been working at [improving our technical capabilities](https://twitter.com/personae_labs/status/1621575568109223936?s=20).\n\nWith heyanoun v2, we'll upgrade our proving stack to the latest and greatest, which will result in considerably faster (<10s in most cases) proving times.\n\n## Timeline and ask\n\nWe come to the DAO presenting an outcome we believe we can drive towards: zk-pseudonyms available to every nouner and a platform for those pseudonyms to have threaded conversation.\n\n**Our ask to the DAO is $160k in helping us reach this outcome.**\n\nAs it's quite a hefty amount of new technology, we expect this to take ~6months for a team of 3-4 devs.\n\nRestated from above, the deliverables:\n- a new hacker news/reddit-style website, built around\n  - pseudonym selection\n  - zk-gated discussion threading\n- APIs for downstream consumption of conversation\n- integration with the best of our proving stack\n\nAs always, our code will be open sourced and made available for extension and re-use.

Staying true to the Nouns style, the drop will be released via a daily auction, with 100% proceeds from the auctions going back to the NounsDAO treasury.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QnTnl7I.png)\nNFJ lies at the intersection of Nouns, non-fungible tokens (NFT), and fine jewellery. Using NFT to deliver this physical collection, it represents our shared enthusiasm towards this phenomenon where culture and technology converge.\n\nThe NFJ project is a strategic collaboration between three brands:\n1. **Nouns**, with its extensive network and NFT presence\n2. **State Property**, a fine jewellery label known for their contemporary designs, whose distribution network spreads globally, and the choice of many reknown celebrities\n4. **HeyMint**, smart contract and technical experts who have centered their mission around making Web3 accessible to everyone\n\nThrough this collaboration, we hope to achieve the following:\n- Proliferate the brands of all three partners\n- Introduce Nouns and fine jewellery to NFT collectors; introduce blockchain technology and NFTs to traditional fine jewellery audience\n- Develop an exclusive line of fine jewellery that is worth collecting, and for full auction proceeds to go back to the Nouns treasury\n- Create sustainable utility, where Nouns holders can tap onto HeyMint's Smart Contract Launchpad to launch their own NFT collections \n\n---\n# Fine Jewellery, NFT, and Nouns\nFine jewellery is a specific class of jewellery that uses precious metals and gemstones, and is known for their exquisite craftsmanship. Because of their exceptional quality and high value, fine jewellery pieces are often passed down as family heirloom.\n\nThe emergence of NFTs has opened up many possibilities. With Nouns, a self-governing organisation that begets organic brand building has emerged. With fine jewellery, NFT presents a means to collect and authenticate fine jewellery with ease.\n\nNFJ celebrates Nouns by incorporating Nounish elements everywhere. Designing around Nounish elements instead of a specific Noun gives the jewellery pieces broad appeal, and when collectors discover their backstory, it becomes extra meaningful. Our goal is to start with an exclusive first collection, with potential for wider releases as awareness and demand grow.\n\n---\n# **The NFJ Project**\n\n**The NFJ Project comprises of a few key deliverables:**\n1. Design and crafting of the 1/1 physical jewellery pieces\n2. NFJ exhibition\n3. Media event and online proliferation\n4. Daily timed-auctions\n5. Redemption for physical jewellery with NFT\n6. Post-event activations\n\n**1: Design And Crafting**\nThe NFJ collection embodies the vibrancy of the Noun characters. Taking cue from iconic Noun traits, the collection is an artistic expression of meme culture and Nouns culture while retaining the quintessential luxe of fine jewellery.\n\nAll our physical jewellery will be made in 18-Karat gold and will contain gemstones ranging from white diamonds, coloured diamonds, sapphires, rubies, and tsavorites. Specific specifications as shown below: \n![](https://i.imgur.com/zqkYDBl.jpg)\n\nThere are a total of nine designs, each of which are bespoke and one-of-a-kind. This is similar to the concept of 1/1 NFTs where there is only ever one of that piece and its provenance is cemented on the blockchain.\n\nThe technical drawings above showcase State Property's creative vision and their artistry in adopting Nounish aesthetics. In giving this luxury spin to Nouns, State Property has designed for these pieces to appeal to the luxury fine jewellery audience that they are very familiar with, and are aware of clients who will be eager to get their hands on them. \n\nUpon passing of the proposal and successive funding, the designs will be turned into 3D, moulded, and then crafted. Thereafter, we'll do a photoshoot of the physical pieces. \n\n**2: Jewellery Exhibition**\nThe launch of NFJ kicks off with a fortnight-long exhibition for these nine jewellery pieces, hosted at State Property's Atelier. There will be daily online features during the campaign period on [NounsinSG Twitter](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg) and  State Property's [socials](https://instagram.com/thisisstateproperty), sharing the backstory and inspiration behind the collection and the designs. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/97Aw6WO.jpg)\n*Outside view of State Property Atelier's main showroom – decorated with Noggles.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eITF36S.jpg)\n*Display showcase updated in Noggles and the collection theme.*\n\nLocated in the civic district of Singapore, the State Property showroom at [Armenian Street](https://www.nac.gov.sg/resources/engagements-with-the-sector/45-armenian-street) is the perfect venue for the exhibition and event. The area has been designated as an arts space and often draws in huge crowds during seasonal events. Utilising State Property's space is strategic and would also lower the ask of the proposal.\n\nBased on our expected timeline, we plan for the exhibition to coincide with [Token2049](https://www.asia.token2049.com/) (13–14 September 2023) and [F1 Singapore](https://www.gpmotorsportstickets.com/formula-1/singapore-grand-prix-tickets/) (15–17 September 2023). While Token2049 attracts a Web3 audience, F1 draws in tourists from around the world. \n\nState Property's central location and proximity to these events makes it really easy for interested visitors to hop over to check out the exhibition during the week. Our goal is to maximise attendance and reach of the exhibition, which will grow the attention and demand for the auction. Thereafter, the media event will happen the week after the F1 weekend so as to deconflict from the packed schedule of international visitors.\n\n**3: Media Event And Online Proliferation**\nThe key highlight of the exhibition will be the media night. This will be held on the second week of the exhibition.\n\n> **Expected Event Dates**\nExhibition: 11 Sep, Monday – 24 Sep, Sunday\nMedia Night: 22 Sep, Friday\nDaily Auctions: 25 Sep, Monday – 3 Oct, Tuesday\n\nWe'll be inviting the local media and influencers to cover the event. The NFJ collection will also be featured in [Tatler Asia](https://www.tatlerasia.com/) magazine *(Luxury media brand in Asia with over 3M monthly online visitors)*, and will be covered by jewellery reviewer, [Katerina Perez](https://katerinaperez.com/) (*Jewellery insider with over 13 years experience and over 400K Followers on Instagram*).\n\nWe will also extend invitations to various NFT communities as well as State Property's clientele. And on the event day, we will have a Nouns booth by @NounsinSG to share more about Nouns, and also a [NFT Workshop](https://www.wereearly.xyz/resources/intro-to-nft) hosted by @Han (Beetle) to introduce NFTs to the non-Web3 fine jewellery audience.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bb09JvH.png)\n\n**4. Daily Timed-Auctions**\nAt the end of the exhibition and event, we will kickstart the online auction for the 1/1 Jewellery NFTs in Nouns-style i.e. one NFT per day. Each time an auction is settled, the settlement transaction will also cause the next NFT to be released and a new 24H auction to begin. **Full proceeds from the auctions will go to the Nouns treasury.**\n\nWinners of the auction will be able to receive the corresponding 1/1 Jewellery. This is done through a redemption process on the website, and they will receive the physical jewellery at no additional cost.\n\n**5.Redemption For Physical Jewellery With NFT**\nWhen all the daily auctions conclude, the website will be updated with a Redemption Page. Jewellery NFT owners will be able to redeem for the physical jewellery. \n\nThe redemption process requires NFT owners to enter their personal particulars and delivery details, and a confirmation email will be sent before the delivery is dispatched. During the process, NFT owners need to allow the website to read the wallet for the NFT and sign an on-chain transaction to update the NFT. \n\nOnce redeemed, the NFT will be updated with a 'Redeemed' status. Buyers and owners of a 'Redeemed' NFT will not be able to redeem for the physical jewellery. Redemption of the physical jewellery is optional. \n\n**6.Post-Event Activations**\nNFJ is more than a one-time activation. We want to ensure continuity with whatever we've been funded to build, which includes releasing a second collection and giving access to a NFT launchpad.\n\n**I: The Noggle Collection**\nYou might notice that none of the designs in the first collection incorporated the Noggle. This was intentional so that the designs can have broad appeal while being Nounish. As fine jewellery is often an article that initiates conversation, we also want people to ask, \"What about the Noggles?\"\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RuOIK35.png)\n\nThis brings us to the second collection, which will be released as demand scales up. These will be customisable and also redeemable for their physical counterparts. \n\n**II: Build With HeyMint**\n[HeyMint](https://heymint.xyz) has developed two tools – an allowlist manager, and a no-code NFT creator tool, HeyMint. While the basic smart contract launchpad is free to use, premium features like Staking, Burning, Soulbinding, Refunds, and Snapshots, are token-gated to partnered communities. With the NFJ collaboration, HeyMint will grant Nouns holders premium access, which means that builders within the Nouns ecosystem will get permanent access to these creator tools.\n\n---\n\n# **Who We Are**\n[**State Property**](https://thisisstateproperty.com)\nEstablished since 2015, State Property is a fine jewellery label whose minimalistic and modern designs have been worn by Michelle Obama, Nicole Kidman, Taylor Swift, and many other celebrities. Their jewellery have also been featured in magazines including Vogue, Tatler, Cosmopolitan, and WWD. Based in Singapore, their distribution network stretches across the Middle East, EU, UK, and US (including [Net-A-Porter](https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-us/shop/designer/state-property)).\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DROOkEg.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KqyfR5Z.jpg)\n\nState Property's collections are often inspired by nature, architecture, and even the stars, and they have a knack to imbue storytelling into their designs. For example, they have a collection (*[Voyager](https://thisisstateproperty.com/collections/the-voyager)*) with pieces named after famous adventurers, while another collection (*[Unfold](https://thisisstateproperty.com/collections/unfold)*) reimagines the classic pearl in contemporary settings. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jkxtzOX.png)\n\nState Property's clientele are typically working professionals or high net worth individuals who can afford to spend on fine jewellery. They are attracted to State Property's unique and contemporary designs that can be worn casually or for more formal occasions.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SMvpaAk.jpg)\nEdgy designs, celebrity fanfare, and established distribution aside, State Property is uniquely positioned to step into the NFT scene. With their design-centric background and artistic interest, founders Ruiyin and Afzal recognises the advent of NFT as another platform for creative expression, just like jewellery. Their readiness to experiment and embrace new innovations also positions them to onboard the largely traditional industry and non-Web3 collectors into the space. \n\n**[HeyMint](https://heymint.xyz)**\nA team of creatives and developers who aims to build the best free tools available so as to help make Web3 mainstream. HeyMint are experienced technical builders and has helped major brands in the NFT space with their drops, including Zen Academy, World Of Women Galaxy, Kingship, and The Littles. Founders Mai Akiyoshi and Ben Yu are software engineers at heart and have grown their passion into a technical team who build tools for the Web3 economy.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PapVaWA.png)\n\nWith NFJ, HeyMint are the right fit as technical partners as they envision a similar future shaped by Web3 builders. NFJ is just the start that adds a single Auction function onto their Launchpad. Opening up their Launchpad to the many builders within the Nouns ecosystem also puts them in the best position to tap onto these creative minds, while they focus on being the technical experts. The potential projects that will come out of this collaboration is endless and will certainly contribute to the exponential growth and adoption of Web3 and NFTs.\n\n**Han [(Beetle)](https://twitter.com/beetleswt)**\nThe one who ties it all together. Han is an active community lead in CloneX Singapore; he regularly coordinates local meet-ups and collaborates with other global CloneX community leads to spearhead initiatives for the community.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SalAzSa.jpg)\nHan believes that the future of brand building is NFTs and brands will build in a ground-up manner alongside their communities. He runs regular NFT workshops for small groups and for corporates to introduce them to the concept of cryptocurrencies and NFTs. The workshops include a hands-on NFT minting session that uses Nouns Playground to create the visuals and leads to a discussion on DAOs. *See [presentation materials](https://www.wereearly.xyz/resources/intro-to-nft).* \n\nOver the past three years, Han has worked closely with State Property with their digital marketing efforts. He was also one of the early evangelists with the HeyMint team. In bringing together all the contributing partners, Han will also be the main project lead coordinating on the physical jewellery and technical end, while working alongside Karl to engage with the NFT communities.\n\n**[Karl](https://twitter.com/WideEyeKarl) (@Nounsinsg)**\nKarl is a Nouns evangelist who spearheaded [@Nounsinsg](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg), a proliferation pod focused on raising Nouns Presence in Singapore. His fascination with the organic growth of Nouns has led him to onboard many traditional brands, builders, and NFT collectors into Nouns.\n\nIt was through the [Nounish Beach Clean Up](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-nounish-beach-clean-up/1653/15?u=wideeyekarl) when Karl and Han met, which led to the current NFJ proposal, where high-level creatives like State Property are onboarded. His enthusiasm is highly infectious and his Nounish contribution inspired many other builders in the NFT space.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hP0qGd0.png)\n\nKarl's main role in this project will be as a strategic advisor and gatekeeper to ensure the project stays aligned with the Nouns ethos. He'll also be working alongside Han to engage other NFT communities, and will be the Nouns ambassador running the Nouns booth during the exhibition and media event.\n\n---\n\n# Funds Break Down\n\n\n**1.

The plan is to rebrand a venue currently owned by 87Bones ([Noun 552](https://nouns.wtf/noun/552)) in Melbourne, Australia, turning it ‘Nounish’. With this we will create an open franchisable package with the intention of scale. The team is already highly respected in the industry with experience across the breadth of the field. As the venue is already a profitable business, we believe this would be a low-risk opportunity for Nouns to enter the IRL space. After initial funding this site will be totally self-sustainable.\n\nThe shop redesign will be largely cosmetic.  A benefit of recreating an already established venue is that most of the infrastructure and industrial equipment has already been purchased.\n\nInstead, the funding will be spent on ‘Nounifying’ the deli and adding custom fixtures to proliferate the brand. The new design will feature screens displaying the nouns daily auctions amongst other Nounish content. We will install large display shelves allowing the sale of a custom merch and a consumable range. Alongside the Nouns deli branded merch and consumable, this space could be an additional platform for previous and future successful Nouns proposals to sell their products on consignment.\n\nOur goal is to build the Nouns Deli brand into a scalable business, opening up opportunities to expand around the world. Sticking to the Nouns CC0 philosophy, our vision is to build a fee-less franchise model; we intend to make everything open source, available to all. As this is rare in the hospitality industry, we expect it to gain a lot of attention, and with it the potential for even more brand proliferation. [Goldy](https://twitter.com/Goldypix) (Nounish, Goat Club) & Jarmen ([Noun 332](https://nouns.wtf/noun/332)) will be jumping on the team in Noun advisory roles to focus on public relations/education & content.\n\nThe Deli / The Team **⌐◧-◧**\n----------------------------\n\nStan’s Deli is a local community hotspot, positioned off one of Melbourne’s most popular boutique shopping strips comprising over 400 retail shops. The area is central to some of Melbourne’s most affluent suburbs. Stan’s is known for its coffee and sandwiches, consistently being voted in the top 5 sandwich venues in Melbourne. The deli has been operating as a profitable business for 3 years with a further 3x3x3 left on the lease. The owners are three experts in the hospitality and retail industry, who between them operate 10 retail spaces, 3 beverage brands and over 40 years combined experience in the industry.\n\nThis teams owns some of Melbourne’s most iconic venues and have a strong track record: Chef hats (Australia’s Michelin Star), ongoing listings in critics top foodie destinations, best fitout awards and a non-alcoholic beverage brand selling over 1.2 million serves across 8 countries and a VC funding deal of AUD $13m.  \nThe team’s expertise spreads across all aspects of the business, from food and beverage development, day to day business logistics to brand creation and marketing. Between them, they know the ins and outs of creating a successful business.\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/5/5624277e125605b77f0d060c6e66d8bf9224abd1.gif)\n\n[See full video here](http://stansdeli.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-2.mp4)\n\n**Flipping it Nounish ⌐◧-◧**\n----------------------------\n\nTo make the venue truly Nounish, Stan’s Deli will need a full cosmetic facelift. The essential commercial equipment will remain, but significant changes to the design of the deli are needed to highlight the Noun brand. Our goal is to create a timeless sandwich shop model, incorporating the Nounish pixel art-focused design that can easily be replicated in different locations worldwide. Along with this timeless and replicable design, we want to incorporate custom neon Noggles and exterior murals designed by local artists to make each franchise unique to its location.\n\nDriving home the Nouns brand, we want to add a modern twist, installing screens to display the Nouns daily auctions & other Nounish content on rotation. While customers grab a bite, they can engage and learn more about the DAO.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/6QwWSfFk/stansdeliinside-1.jpgg)\n\n**CC0 ⌐◧-◧**\n------------\n\nWith a CC0 culture, the new Nouns Deli will change the narrative in the hospitality industry. Currently, it all happens behind closed doors; the secret herbs and spices, special burger sauces. Heck, coke has its recipe in a bank vault that only two people can access at a time. We want to spread the Nouns CC0 philosophy and make everything open source through our CC0 library; recipes, package designs and branding assets will all be made available on our website. The wave of interest and attention the CC0 model will create in this industry will give us the perfect platform to share these core Nouns values.\n\n**The Model ⌐◧-◧**\n------------------\n\nThe team is proposing a franchisable model for scaling when ready. Adhering to the Nouns philosophy, there will be no fee associated with this franchise model. To ensure the brand is held to a high standard, those wishing to be officially affiliated with Nouns Deli will have to undertake a compulsory screening process. Once the original Nouns Deli is established, our team will provide consulting and mentoring services to approved franchisees. The goal is for scalability, the ability to replicate across the world.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/Xv8j0ybp/a28d36944e9a917b2c2d81a5e45d81b0.jpg)\n\n**The App ⌐◧-◧ -**\n------------------\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/hjZKXWhn/NOUN-LOYALTY-APP.jpg)\n\nA custom app will be developed as an easily accessible platform for the Noun’s Deli community and will extend to include any additional franchises. The app will reward regular customers through a loyalty program model, allowing them to earn points towards benefits or discounts with each purchase; a modern day coffee loyalty card. Customers will stay engaged through the use of push notifications, delivering exclusive offers such as happy hours discounts and CTA rewards. These push notifications can also be an opportunity to circulate engaging creative content and Nounish news. The CC0 library will also be made available on the app, alongside cooking videos and other educational tools. Our mobile app will encourage return clientele, creating an experience that extends the reach beyond the physical brick and mortar offerings, drawing them back to further engage with Nouns.\n\n**Proliferation/touch points ⌐◧-◧**\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe potential for proliferation with a franchise model grows with every expansion. The team has a presence in the local hospitality industry and strong existing relationships with three core media agencies in Melbourne—Broadsheet, UrbanList, and Concrete Playground—which have a combined reach of 6.4 million. The team will use these connections to gain feature articles and free marketing. Our paid marketing strategies will focus on two areas: online viability using large platforms such as Twitter to reach current untapped audiences, and physical presence focusing on capturing the already large NFT culture within Melbourne. This would include poster runs, pop-up NFT events, and catering to NFT/Web3 conferences. To ensure the Nounish culture of giving is also proliferated, we hope to give out free Nouns ‘Deli Burgers’ wrapped in noggles paper to underprivileged communities. We want to highlight the incredible impact this DAO has had and will continue to have, essentially sharing the story.\n\nOur vision for the first permanent Nouns IRL store is bigger than just a sandwich shop with Noggles painted on; we want to create an approachable educational tool for the DAO. QR codes on coffee cups, enabling us to direct daily traffic selected content, such as the ‘This is Nouns’ video highlighting content from other successful props. Currently averaging around 100,000 coffee sales each year, this is just one easily executed proliferation tool.\n\nAs we are entering uncharted territory for the DAO we believe transparency with data collection from these marketing tools and activations is useful information for the community and future proposers. All analytics gathered will be made available on our website.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/C15gTP7Q/ezgif-5-e168849c16.gif)\n\nThe Sauce ⌐◧-◧\n==============\n\nAn avenue we believe has huge potential is a “Nouns Deli Sauce” range. We want to create a packaged consumable range that will be featured throughout our in-store menu. Launching the range will be the “Nouns Hot Sauce”. Our dear friend, Mathew Garthweight, owner of [Mats Hot Shop](https://matshotshop.com/en-us)—Australia’s leading boutique hot sauce distributor—will collaborate with Nouns Deli to produce our very own “Nouns Hot Sauce”. The products will be available to ship worldwide, allowing consumers to recreate Nouns Deli sandwiches at home. Matt has previously created his own range of hot sauces with huge success, winning multiple international competitions. Upon release, one hot sauce will be made claimable for each Noun holder. Other sauces we intend to roll out into the range are “Nouns Burger Sauce” and “Nouns Dipping Ranch”, but the possibilities are endless and can be rolled out according to consumer demand.\n\nBuilding out our new menu, we plan to feature a ‘Deli Burger’ as a nod to Noun 552 owned by 87Bones. This burger will be served in branded sleeves, and is sure to be one of the most recognizable items on the menu. Furthermore, the Deli Burger will be the item served at all of our pop-up events. Additionally, we will invite guest chefs to collaborate and create menu items inspired by other Nouns.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/hhWWmSBk/ezgif-3-71fedd840b.gif)\n\n**Retail/Merch ⌐◧-◧**\n---------------------\n\nStan’s Deli has been highly successful with its merchandise in the past, so we intend to release some branded Nouns Deli merchandise. The first drop will feature Nouns Deli t-shirts, hoodies, coffee mugs, a tote bag, and our consumable range.\n\nFurthermore, we would like to use our space to create a platform for previous and future successful Nouns proposals to sell their products on consignment, thus providing another platform for the success of Nouns products.\n\n**ROI ⌐◧-◧**\n------------\n\nThis is not merely a “flash-in-the-pan” proposition; instead, the intention is to promote long-term proliferation of Nouns. The store will serve as a “permanent” educational billboard for the DAO, enabling it to capture public attention and provide information and content through multiple touchpoints. This will create a scalable IP for public benefit. Moreover, the store will be an opportunity to grow the community, share resources and knowledge regarding the DAO. Having already established itself as a popular foodie destination, and with a team committed to providing great hospitality supplemented with education, Nouns Deli is set to be a success.\n\n**The Risk ⌐◧-◧**\n-----------------\n\nWhy would we close a profitable business? \"As a recently minted Noun holder, I’m committed to the Nouns brand and believe it can become widely recognised in the near future. The Nouns model aligns with my morals and values and I want to use my resources and skill set to proliferate this incredible brand.” - 87Bones.\n\n**Additional Factors ⌐◧-◧**\n---------------------------\n\nThe rebranding fit-out will cause some time of closure and loss of revenue, we predict around 2 months until Nouns Deli can open its doors to the public. Having built a strong team over the past three years, we would like to hold on to the core members through this time. We intend to utilise this time to educate our team on all things Nouns, by reopening, our team will be able to guide our guests through the nouns ecosystem with ease.\n\nOther costs that will continue during the closure are rent, insurance, utilities and other creditors.\n\nThe Budget ⌐◧-◧\n---------------\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/9Q2z527g/NOUNS-BUDGET.jpg)\n\nPayment Schedule ⌐◧-◧\n---------------------\n\nWe are proposing a three-milestone payment schedule for funds from the multi-sig.

At Poolsuite, we’re a small team of passionate builders with a desire to create beautiful internet products, and we’re keen to understand the appetite within the Nouns community to collaborate. While we don’t yet have a treasury that enables us to focus our primary efforts on public goods, we can bring our deep understanding of consumer products and expertise in crafting rich brand worlds to the Nouns ecosystem. In the same way we have begun collaborating with major designer brands (alpha soon) we want to do the same within web3, and we see Nouns as one the most actively engaged and innovative communities in the space, uniquely positioned for us to work with on wonderfully designed products that push forward web3 adoption alongside the combined awareness of our brands.\n\n**INTRODUCING NOUNS WALLET SERVICE**\n\n---\n\nNouns Wallet Service would allow any user to add **any NFT** (or ERC-20) into their Apple/Android wallet — the same place they keep their loyalty cards, boarding passes, and credit cards — unlocking the ability for web3 communities to send push notifications to token holders and a wealth of powerful future use cases. This tool would be usable by any Ethereum based DAO/NFT collection. \n\n![Screenshot 2023-01-09 at 10.20.37 PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XJ8yckxs/Screenshot-2023-01-09-at-10-20-37-PM.png)\n\n**Why?**\n\n- In the mainstream view, NFTs are still mostly seen as investment assets but placing NFTs side by side with loyalty cards and boarding passes tangibly demonstrates that they offer much more and can unlock a variety of experiences. To bring the next wave of mainstream users to web3, we need tools that make the web3 experience as friendly as web2.\n- There's an engagement problem in web3; its incredibly hard to communicate with token holders. We've seen this first hand fighting our way to the top of the Twitter feed to notify our [Executive Members](https://members.poolsuite.net/) of new drops. A lot of communities are building their own apps to try to solve this engagement challenge but not every project needs an app.\n- The shutdown of the Nouns Discord opened the door for reimagining what the communication and social layers can look like for decentralized communities. Nouns communications are currently fragmented. And while there are various [chat groups](https://nouns.center/groups), [newsletters](https://nouns.substack.com/), and Twitter accounts, there is no simple real-time communication layer that is gaining significant traction.\n\n****************************Considerations****************************\n\n- Nouns Wallet Service would be a free tool, available to every web3 community.\n- Every new community that uses the tool would proliferate the noggles and their association with building public web3 infrastructure. Nouns Wallet Service would launch as “Nouns Wallet Service public infrastructure by Nouns DAO”, similar to [Prop House](https://prop.house/), [Nouns Builder](https://nouns.build/), [Voters.wtf](https://www.voters.wtf/nouns).\n- Unlike with mobile apps, push notifications are enabled by default with wallet passes, meaning no additional opt-in is required.\n- Last year we built an early version of Wallet Service for our Executive Members that generated a ton of excitement within our community, and we’re confident we can develop this into a fully-packaged service that works incredibly well for both centralized and decentralized communities.\n- We’ve passed Lil Nouns prop lot with 687 upvotes (9% consensus) – s/o Lil Nouns community for feedback, helping us shape up this proposal, and for putting this proposal onchain.\n\n**Funding Request**\n\nWe’re asking for 120 ETH to design and build Nouns Wallet Service including 1 year of maintenance from our team. To bring the next wave of mainstream users to web3, we need tools that make the web3 experience as friendly as web2 – and we believe these tools should be built as public infrastructure, freely available for all DAOs. The funding would go towards:\n\n- **Web App** – Designing & building a beautiful interactive web app where users will be able to connect wallet and select which NFTs to add to their mobile wallet (on desktop: scan QR, on mobile: download natively). We’ll design this interface alongside the Nouns community to reach an exceptional execution of the Nouns brand.\n- **Token Integration** – Building upon our rudimentary alpha version to integrate with any Ethereum token based community (ERC-721, 1155, and 20)\n- **Custom Push Notifications** – Creating a customizable push notification system where Nouners (and other Nounish DAO members) will be able to choose frequency (live, daily, weekly) and type of notifications from a selection of onchain events (new proposal submitted, funded, voting open, capital deployed, prop house voting open, etc.).\n- **Admin Panel** – Creating an admin panel for teams to manage & send custom push notifications & update the text & links on the back of the passes.\n- **Pass Designs** – Automating the design process of wallet passes based on any NFT visual assets. For Nouns and lil Nouns we’ll design custom passes which we’ll share with the community for approval. For other communities, we’ll automatically assign a color scheme based on the NFT imagery (unique for each NFT).\n\n********************************Potential future use cases********************************\n\n- Token gating IRL with a QR scanner: Wallet Service would allow for a very simple 1 NFT = 1 Event Ticket gating system.\n- Integrating new sources of notifications for Nouns/Nounish DAOs such as Prop House events, votes from key delegates (Nouncil voted “For” Proposal 367), 3rd party sources to select from (ex. Discord), etc.\n- Ability to customize pass fields to include points/token balance(s), contributor status, awards, and to allow users to add their name to the card or select their own colors."},{"blockNumber":16870150,"blockHash":"0x6f804759378bc12573ca2d221ffc31620b4fc0c6b44fd67ecb2e0d307a596eb0","transactionIndex":83,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x1d2dfa4d94cc4985258478ce6a6bfc2d67678458d2fb64ad9eaf88c9ce3cd665","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":256,"proposer":"0x0055CD5F017027D10ADF4f13332181e6D8D886BB","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)",""],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000d343b8dae88e117d25c181317cf6811166911b11000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000244ddaaf40","0x"],"startBlock":16906150,"endBlock":16942150,"description":"# The First Triple Back Flip in a Wheelchair\n\n![https://i.imgur.com/fK4ZyaR.png](https://i.imgur.com/fK4ZyaR.png)\n\n**Hi, I’m [Noun 64](https://twitter.com/dorculas) 👋**\n\nIn this proposal, I want to create a unique and inspiring moment in time for all of Nouns to rally around. I believe Nouns is one of the best storytelling protocols as it provides the opportunity for anyone to add to that story in a very meaningful way to proliferate the meme. With Aaron “Wheelz” Fotheringham and my team, we will create a story that will capture the hearts and minds of Nouners and people outside of the Nouns ecosystem alike and provide on-chain lore for future creatives to play around with.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n- Create a 5-7 minute Nounish documentary that dives into Wheelz' amazing story and follows him in his journey to do **the first triple back flip in a wheelchair**\n- Produce raw content and b-roll around the entire project to be released as CC0 on [everydayforever.wtf](http://everydayforever.wtf)\n- Upon completion, we will submit a droposal to have the documentary minted as an Open Edition where 50% of proceeds go to NounsDAO and the other 50% of proceeds go to Life Rolls On\n\n**Who is Wheelz?**\n[****Nikki Bella Gets EMOTIONAL As She Hits Her First Golden Buzzer For Aaron Wheelz!****]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5DI64O15Ow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5DI64O15Ow))\n![https://i.imgur.com/X7BNG4I.png](https://i.imgur.com/X7BNG4I.png)\n\n[****Aaron \"Wheelz\" Fotheringham INSANE Wheelchair Athlete Top Moments in Nitro Circus History****]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw7tsMVnvrw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw7tsMVnvrw))\n![https://i.imgur.com/DZDkKRm.png](https://i.imgur.com/DZDkKRm.png)\n\nWhen I first started ideating what I wanted to do with my first proposal, I thought back on all of the people I’ve met that resonated with my interpretation of the idea of Nounishness and Wheelz was one of the first people I thought of. He’s an incredibly genuine human that lives life in an absolutely full send way. He’s been on tour with Nitro Circus, participated in X Games, holds multiple Guinness World Records and has been featured on ESPN, CNN, and Bleacher Report.\n\nI asked him one day, “what’s something crazy you want to do?” He responded with, “I’ve wanted to do the first triple back flip in a wheelchair for a while now but haven’t gotten the time to work on it.” I got goosebumps and immediately started figuring out how we could make this reality.\n\n**What are we doing with Wheelz?**\n\nWe will create a Nounish documentary that follows Wheelz through the journey of executing **the first triple back flip on a wheelchair**. A doc that gives you a window into Wheelz’ story and the story of him doing the unimaginable - filled with joy and perseverance but doesn’t take itself too seriously. This story will serve as a piece of Nouns lore to be enjoyed and to be forked for future Nounish content.\n\nTo execute this, we will first need a mega ramp. Luckily, we’ve connected with a mega ramp builder that has built ramps for the likes of X Games and Nitro Circus and he’s willing to rent his ramp to us for our short doc.\n\nHere’s the crazy 30-foot mega ramp that we would be using:\n\n![https://i.imgur.com/eWSeRKg.png](https://i.imgur.com/eWSeRKg.png)\n\nThe ramp is awesome, right? Next, we need a team that is capable of producing a Nounish documentary. This is why I’m bringing in Zack Patrick - who is a talented friend of mine that can handle all aspects of this documentary from the action sports videography to the drone footage to the storytelling. Below you can find some of his amazing work:\n\n[****The Art of Surfing (Sponsored by Jackery)****]([https://vimeo.com/721340785](https://vimeo.com/721340785))\n![https://i.imgur.com/7UtbK0L.png](https://i.imgur.com/7UtbK0L.png)\n\n[****Can I Kick It?

Like I said above, this documentary will be as Nounish as possible - joyful, creative, inspirational yet it doesn’t take itself too seriously.\n\nIn addition, we will Nounify the entire documentary by procuring a Nounish custom wheelchair, Nounish marketing materials for the mega ramp, a large inflatable pair of Noggles to have on set of the triple back flip, and some Nounish goods already created and funded via NounsDAO. \n\n![https://i.imgur.com/mR5OivM.png](https://i.imgur.com/mR5OivM.png)\n\nWhen we finish the short doc, we will premiere it on Youtube and Twitter and then send a droposal to the DAO to release it as an open edition where 50% of the proceeds will go back to NounsDAO and the other 50% will go to Life Rolls On - a non-profit organization picked by Wheelz that is dedicated to improving the quality of life for young people affected by spinal cord injury and utilizes action sports as a platform for inspiring the infinite possibilities beyond paralysis. \n\nWe will also launch [everydayforever.wtf](http://everydayforever.wtf) as a CC0 repository for select footage we take during this process. We want to encourage collaboration and inspire creators to experiment with all of this Nounish content we’re creating. As part of the proposal, we will also be managing, maintaining and expanding on the collection of Nouns CC0 material on everydayforever.wtf for a year.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nOur aim is to have everything delivered within 6 months at the latest. \n\n**The Future**\n\nWhat a great thing to think about. I hope to tell more awesome stories about Nounish folks in my life and bring them into the ever-growing Nouns Universe. Leveling up with each proposal, making you all smile and having fun is the goal.\n\nWith [everydayforever.wtf](http://everydayforever.wtf) I want to collect and aggregate as much Nounish CC0 material in one place so that anyone from anywhere can build on top of the magic we’re building here. \n\n**Team**\n\n**Dwight Torculas (Noun 64)** - Previously, I was the cofounder & CEO of the music NFT company Mint Songs which was recently acquired by Napster.

Let’s be where developers, creatives, and entrepreneurs gather to build. The Nouns Fair is the space to have fun, experience culture, build, and proliferate Nouns all at once!\n\n## WTF?\n\n> **The Nouns Fair is an IRL experience that aims to spread Nouns among hackers and builders in web3.**\n\nAs ETHGlobal states, they are growing the most valuable developer community in web3. At their hackathons, engineers, designers, and product leaders come together for three days to collaborate on building something amazing. The Nouns Fair is a dedicated space for them inside the hackathon where we create a fun nounish atmosphere. This makes Nouns associated with a positive and memorable experience.\n\nThe Nouns Fair serves different purposes to help hackers learn about Nouns:\n\n- **Awareness** – hackers taking pictures at our photo sets and wearing cool Nounish swag\n- **Learning** – we spend three full days answering questions about all things nounish\n- **Building** – there will be a pool of 5k in prizes for nounish projects\n\n> **The Nouns Fair is perfect for creating a builders’ cycle on a weekend.\nAwareness > Learning > Building > Proliferation > Awareness > …**\n\nWe can’t miss this opportunity to put Nouns in the eyes of thousands of talented hackers!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yiRMrzj.png)\n\n## So far…\n\nWe’ve hosted three editions of the Nouns Fair at ETHGlobal hackathons: in Mexico, Colombia, and the USA. After three editions we've confirmed the importance of this kind of event to increase awareness, onboard potential builders, and put noggles in the eyes of thousands. \n\nWe managed to put Nouns and noggles in the eyes of:\n\n- 3,700 people in\n- 3 cities: Mexico City, Bogota, and San Francisco, during\n- 9 full days of nounishness with\n- 3 Nouns Fair editions\n\nAll this blended with the local culture:\n\n- Piñatas\n- Games\n- Candies\n- Fortune cookies with nounish luck and a\n- Nouns flower power VW bus\n\nWe also distributed nounish swag, including:\n\n- 800 t-shirts\n- 600 pins\n- 1,600 stickers\n- 400 POAPs\n\n**Nouns Fair Mexico**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uF8U2f9.jpg)\n\n**Nouns Fair Bogota**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7ZwmTqR.jpg)\n\n**Nouns Fair San Francisco**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uv5vAcJ.jpg)\n\n**Want more photos?** Here are [our photobooks on Flickr ↗︎](https://www.flickr.com/photos/196499305@N03/albums).\n\n**Want videos?** This is the vibe of each of the editions of the Nouns Fair!\n\n**Nouns Fair ETHMexico**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/4ZuQBNS.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRTegTUFwHM)\n\n**Nouns Fair ETHBogota**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/mMKxNuc.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe1R5WFT9_E)\n\n**Nouns Fair ETHSanFrancisco**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/FIi1QYh.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij0MoUOV-OE)\n\n**Want more proliferation?** Since the Nouns Fair happens inside the hackathon, ETHGlobal video recaps have been nounified, putting ⌐◨-◨  in the eyes of the Ethereum community.\n\n**ETHMexico Recap**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/655mczu.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPNu1QTxC0w)\n\n**ETHBogota Recap**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/hbPrIn1.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMbtSPFB9j0)\n\n**ETHSanFrancisco Recap**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/Z5n7jdR.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHiIMvGLBZc)\n\n**Want more details?** Here are more detailed reports of each Nouns Fair edition on Discourse:\n\n- [Nouns Fair at ETHMexico report ↗︎](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-nouns-fair-eth-mx/1777/6?u=mono) (Funded by NSFW)\n- [Nouns Fair at ETHBogota report ↗︎](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethbogota/2326/7?u=mono) (Funded by NSFW)\n- [Nouns Fair at ETHSanFrancisco report ↗︎](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethsanfrancisco/2709/4?u=mono) (Funded by NSFW and reimbursed via [on-chain ↗︎](https://nouns.wtf/vote/162))\n\n**Want some alpha?** San Francisco's fair was used as the set for the Nouns Documentary – hopefully, we'll make it to the cut 🙊\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wZPO9lM.jpg)\n\n## What do people say about the Nouns Fair?\n\nHundreds of people have enjoyed previous editions of the Nouns Fair. Their faces of joy smashing piñatas, getting candies, winning a T-shirt for playing foosball and just having a good time taking pictures with giant noun heads and learning about Nouns says it all! – We asked a few folks to tell us a bit of their experience at the Nouns Fair.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2ZWPge6.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3rH2ePX.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IJ8Esyu.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yHSz1Kp.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/48wpqHW.png)\n\n## What is the plan?\n\n**The Nouns Fair will be a cultural experience focused on builders where they will be able to engage with others, learn and build with Nouns.** These activations will be localized nounish experiences with photo opportunities, games, swag, and dedicated hosts answering every question about Nouns and building.\n\nWe want to keep onboarding international builders and help others create on top of Nouns. To do so, we plan to go to six IRL ETHGlobal hackathons forecasted for 2023.\n\n1. **[ETHGlobal Lisbon ↗︎](https://ethglobal.com/events/lisbon)**: May 12 → May 14 \n2. **[ETHGlobal Waterloo ↗︎](https://ethglobal.com/events/waterloo2023)**: June 23 → June 25\n3. **[ETHGlobal Paris ↗︎](https://ethglobal.com/events/paris2023)**: July 21 → July 23\n4. **[ETHGlobal New York ↗︎](https://ethglobal.com/events/newyork2023)**: September 22 → September 24\n5. **[ETHGlobal Istambul ↗︎](https://ethglobal.com/events/istanbul)**: November (TBC)\n6. ETHGlobal Devcon: Q4 (TBC)\n\nCountries and dates may change during the year. We’ll adjust accordingly as things unfold.\n\n**More info:** [Announcing the 2023 ETHGlobal Season article ↗︎](https://ethglobal.medium.com/announcing-the-2023-ethglobal-season-3cc1960de7b4) / [Updates to the 2023 ETHGlobal Hackathon Season ↗︎](https://ethglobal.medium.com/updates-to-the-2023-ethglobal-hackathon-season-1d2a9d418c91)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/X5XHeIZ.jpg)\n\n## What to expect?\n\nAfter three editions, we now know that making people's first experience with Nouns fun and meaningful makes the perfect environment to be receptive about wtf is Nouns, how the DAO works, and how people can collaborate. \n\nThis year we'll focus on making builders build with Nouns by doubling our efforts on incentivizing them to materialize their ideas with Nouns from the start. We’ll introduce a new way to learn the nounish vibe and encourage people to build in-site with Nouns: the **Nouns Prize.**\n\n### **Nouns Prize – wtf?**\n\nPeople hacking at the event will get a chance to learn about Nouns by going to the Nouns Fair inside the venue. They will learn they can build on top of Nouns immediately at the hackathon and be rewarded. This is a way to showcase the nounish vibe and incentivize the use of Nouns to build whatever they can imagine. Hundreds of hackers building with Nouns all at once like a massive Nouns Prop House flash round – can you picture that?\n\nThis prize aims to reward builders that:\n\n1. Use Nouns art\n2. Build for the Nouns community\n3. Build public goods using Nouns\n\n**Doing this at every hackathon will help to a) have a dedicated window to onboard hundreds of skilled builders, b) get familiar with the Nouns’ culture, and c) incentivize building constantly.** \n\n> **More builders, more props, more proliferation.**\n\nImagine hackers building with Nouns as they already do with protocols and tools like Polygon, Lens, MetaMask, Uniswap, Aave, etc.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b60kgr5.png)\n\n### Culture á la Nounish\n\nThe Nouns Fair's experience results from great design, excellent execution, and blending of cultures. We wrap all this in a concept we call **culture á la nounish**.\n\nWe've done it differently in each country. In Mexico City, we did it with rustic hand-painted fair stands, games, candies, and nouns piñatas. In Bogota, with a high-quality printed stage highlighting local cultural imagery along with traditional games, toys, and candies. And in San Francisco, with a 60's flower power VW bus and custom Chinese fortune cookies. All this with a pinch of swag. \n\nWe'll keep blending local culture with Nouns in this year's editions of the Nouns Fair. We're excited about the richness of culture this year's locations will bring.\n\n> **Proliferation and culture á la nounish**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JIEHA7N.jpg)\n\n## What is the budget?\n\nWith the experience we’ve had in the previous Fairs, we’ve kept what works best and made some changes, adapting both to each city’s event expectations and social media needs + the Nouns Prize for hackers.\n\nTo make this reality, **we ask for $226,425 USDC worth in funding**, which we'll allocate as follows.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7MSFqnV.png)\n\n*Note 1: The Photo Set, Culture à la Nounish, and Traveling & Accommodation sections are considering a 5% buffer to cover potential changes in prices and schedules throughout the year.*\n\n*Note 2: For security, all funds will be managed by a 3/5 Safe (0xFB35d8B136729D3aB74d687E482F3D16CE18d89C) including Ale, Mono, the Nouns Fair wallet, [Necfas ↗︎](https://twitter.com/necfas), and [Franklin ↗︎](https://twitter.com/franklinvargas).* \n\n## Who are we?\n\n- [Alejandra, Nouns Amigos nounder ↗︎](https://twitter.com/ale_pjimenez)\n- [Mono, Nouns Amigos nounder ↗︎](https://twitter.com/0xMonografia)\n\nWe want to turn the Nouns Fair into a vehicle that can proliferate and attract builders anywhere in the world.

Please direct any questions and conversation to the builders proposing - Brian and Bloomz.\n\n\n## TLDR \n\nWe're requesting 10 ETH to make Nouns DAO a Title Partner of W3BSTOCK NYC, a global live entertainment consortium that empowers artists and revolutionizes the music industry using blockchain technology. By partnering with W3BSTOCK, Nouns DAO will gain significant exposure and align itself with the top-tier global web3 music and arts ecosystem, which is growing rapidly in New York City. The partnership will involve Noun-focused activations, merchandise, and branding throughout the event, targeting a diverse audience of over 1,500 attendees, and providing long-term value to the Nouns community.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZaAkO29.jpg)\n\n## Intro\n\nNOUN YORK CITY 2023!!!\n\nGM Fellow Nouners! \n\nAt W3BSTOCK, our core mission is to proliferate live music and beautiful art into a wider consciousness while providing creators with the tools to pave a more equitable music industry. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, we are spreading education around these tools and showing creators how to drive new forms of revenue, fan engagement, and artistic expression. We believe that by empowering artists, we empower the world, disrupting the outdated music industry and creating a more vibrant and equitable future for all involved. We would LOVE for the Nouns DAO to join us on this exciting journey to revolutionize the world of music and art.\n\nWe are a NYC-based, global live entertainment consortium powering the decentralized music industry, with a core team from diverse live entertainment production entities like Brooklyn Bowl, Relix Magazine, The Capitol Theatre, Lockn' Music Festival, Central Park Summerstage and Universal Music and from artistic and musical members of bluechip NFT communities like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, Crypto Punks (Spottie Wifi is in the DAO), Gutter Cat Gang, Nouns, Lil Nouns, The Visitors, The Alien Boy, and many more. Our organization integrates best-in-class web3 tools and communities to produce concerts, music festivals and other meaningful, memorable experiences in real life, all doubled in the metaverse, all framed around a global mission to fix the live music industry through blockchain to create a better future for creators, venues, event organizers and fans. \n\nFollowing the successful Nouns activations at W3BSTOCK Miami on December 1st, 2022 and the W3BSTOCK x Lil Nouns Denver party on March 4th, 2023. We now have the opportunity for Nouns to make a lasting impression within the W3BSTOCK live music and arts ecosystem, which will reverberate across the thriving New York City web3 community in the artistic and musical epicenter of NFT.NYC and beyond. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y0Cyr22.jpg)\n\n## Event \n\nW3BSTOCK will kick off NFT.NYC this year on the eve of the conference, Tuesday, April 11th with a massive event bringing together over 40 leading music acts from the web3 music ecosystem like Dyl, Rae Isla, Domino, Violetta Zironi, Nifty Sax, The CART3L, Fifi Rong, Jadyn Violet, and Taylor Alexander, and over 30 high profile NFT tastemakers like Dave Krugman / ALLSHIPS, KYD Labs, Aptos, Metasill, Tokenprooof, and many more - This is the biggest lineup of web3 artists playing a single stage in history and we have the opportunity to get the Nouns DAO front and center of not only the NYC event, but the big picture mission at the core of W3BSTOCK: To proliferate live music and beautiful art into a wider consciousness.\n\nW3BSTOCK was hands down the most popular music and art event the day before NFT NYC last year and I expect this year will be no different. With an expected attendance of over 30,000 attendees at NFT.NYC this year, W3BSTOCK realistically projects an attendance of over 1,500 educated, diverse attendees for their event, including in-person attendees and metaverse attendees with organic social media impressions exceeding 20,000. \n\n**Note:** the vast majority of the NYC web3 music community are NOT widely aware of the Nouns DAO and what we are doing - hence the opportunity.\n\nThis is an unprecedented opportunity to align the Nouns community with the top tier global web3 music and arts ecosystem that is emerging from New York and rapidly spreading around the world. We will onboard new community members from the W3BSTOCK music and art community into the Nouns DAO, and we will ensure that the Nouns are tethered inextricably to the paradigm shift that is just beginning for artists and creators. \n\nThis is a different type of NFT event. It is solely focused on live music, beautiful performances, and interactive art activations, rather than a dry panel of speakers or a bunch of speculative crypto bros. \n\nW3BSTOCK has already proliferated incredible web3-enabled music and arts programming in New York, Las Vegas, Miami and London, with forthcoming parties coming up at Bitcoin 2022 in May and at W3BSTOCK Sydney in August. For this reason, I would like Nouns to have a leading presence at this event, so that the Nouns will continue to be a leading cultural tastemaker in this good-to-grey web3 music ecosystem over the long term.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7JLOGHx.jpg)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Rq4b0gB.jpg)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P8n3obSl.jpg)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QpTuXL3l.png)\n\n\n## Description\n\nWe are requesting 10 ETH for **Nouns** to become a **Title Partner** of W3BSTOCK NYC with a complete Nounish takeover of the entire event, including a fully Nounish Photo Booth with a direct social media integration. We will also get Noggles on leading web3 music influencers like Dyl, Violetta Zironi, Rae Isla, and more, on the eve of the conference so they can rock them for the remainder of NFT week and aid in the cultural Nouns proliferation. This will make a large splash and kick off a week of Nounish proliferation at NFT NYC and will also generate loads of awareness for Nouns DAO and their mission.\n\nThe funding breakdown will be as follows:\n\n10 ETH For Title Partnership that will get us:\n* Premiere, exclusive sponsorship of the event which would make it the official Nouns NFT NYC kickoff event\n*  20’x20’ Official Tastemaker IRL Vendor Booth, placed prominently at the main entrance to the event with 2 dedicated 33” Metasill screen and projector to display Nouns NFTs at the front and center of the event\n*   Allow Nouns to curate parts of the event **designing high end fabricated scenes for the photo booth and other pop up activations** at areas all across the event venue\n*   A Nounish photo booth with direct social media integration and a pre-made tweet / IG template that has Nouns tagged. We will offer a free NFT claim to anyone who posts a Nounish photo and tags the Nouns to incentivize an online network effect, and we will offer future utility to these holders at future events within the music and arts web3 ecosystem\n*    100 comps for Nouns holders - which grants access to the immersive VIP Groove Room, open bar, and on site swag and other giveaways\n* Nouns featured with top, premiere placement on invite and promo materials \n* Nouns featured prominently in signage at the event\n* Nouns inspired specialty cocktail on bar menu\n* Branding and link to Nouns.wtf in the Metaverse livestream component of the event\n* Branding across social assets\n* Branding on emails linked to the event\n\n* 50 custom Nouns x W3BSTOCK t-shirts to be given away to holders (first come, first served)\n* 8’ x 8’ Nouns @ W3BSTOCK Step-and-Repeat \n* 47” x 81” Nouns Retractable Banner (which we will carry around and display at multiple events throughout NFT NYC) \n* Noggles for swag bag and for handing out across NFT NYC \n* W3BSTOCK-included VIP table for Nouns community at Nolcha Shows x Crypto Punks event with 3,000 attendees on Weds, April 12th\n* A **guaranteed Nounish activation at the W3BSTOCK x Nolcha Shows** party at the SLS South Beach during Bitcoin 2023 on May 25\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wUNMk3p.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RDfdQaR.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NOT5FzY.jpg)\n\n## ROI To The DAO:\n\nI will show the DAO several returns on investment from this activation from financial, to brand awareness, to growth marketing. I will be collecting data via POAP mints, distributed merch to holders, and social media impressions. We will keep a thorough list of tags on every social platform, Nouns.wtf and nouns.wft link visits during the week, and will provide a full write-up on all of the nounish interactions with artists and creators and the W3BSTOCK event and across NFT NYC. \n\nI will provide a total of **3 reports to the DAO**. The reports will provide **follow up analytics after 7 days, 30 days and 90 days**. The stats I will be tracking are:\n\n•**Branding and proliferation** of Noggles all across NFT.NYC with an estimated 20,000 organic social impressions\n• **Hundreds of photos** of W3BSTOCK and Nouns and other nounish people at the step-and-repeat including leading web3 music and cultural influencers\n• **Website Traffic** to Nouns.wtf \n• **Purchases** - We will have a number of POAP kiosks throughout the event where attendees will mint our Nouns @ W3BSTOCK NFT NYC POAP. Through this, we will have a list of wallet addresses that I will then check those addresses at the 7 day, 30 day and 90 day checkpoints to see if any of those wallet addresses now own a Noun (purchased after the event date)\n• **Photos** either tagging Lil Nouns or Nouns and/or containing Noggles, pulled from every social media platform at 30, 90 and 180s out from the event.\n• **Aggregated brand impressions** from all social media, web visits and NFT purchases post event at each checkpoint\n\nBy proliferating Nouns and Lil Nouns at W3BSTOCK Miami and also our collab Denver event, and also knowing all about W3BSTOCK last NYC event at the same venue, I have been able to see first hand how to best proliferate the nounish brands among the W3BSTOCK arts and music ecosystem. The biggest impacts include:\n\n• **Interactive art**, screens and live minting POAP experiences, and step-and-repeat activations\n• **A strong presence** at the event with a premium booth & Noun maxis to chat with & answer questions\n• **Live music** - This has been oft overlooked in building the Nouns communities and I believe we have massively untapped awareness within the thriving web3 NYC music and arts web3 scene - This proposal will instantly fix that\n• **Branded tote gift bags** handed out to holders \n• **Stickers** - people love collecting stickers and we saw tons of them up around various places in Miami and Denver\n• **T-shirts** - Branded W3BSTOCK x Nouns t-shirts turn attendees into marketing evangelists, and people who come to events and have a great time (like, all of them) are happy to wear merch around to other events at conferences and also post on social media  \n\nIf this proposal is funded we will officially be partnering with the first-to-market and leading web3 music and arts ecosystem which is thriving in New York City. This will allow allow for nounish proliferation over an entire week, not only in W3BSTOCK’s live music and arts ecosystem, but in and around the largest NFT conference in the entire world, in the greatest city in the world, **NOUN YORK CITY!!!!**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe music industry has long been plagued by problems that hurt artists and fans, and this is the most ripe space for blockchain disruption, and this particular use case and demographic has been largely overlooked by the Nouns DAO .... until now. \n\nWe believe that blockchain technology is poised to create a more equitable future for artists, fans, and industry professionals alike. By leveraging the power of blockchain, we're able to provide a platform that enables direct artist-to-fan engagement and fair revenue distribution, cutting out middlemen and gatekeepers who have historically taken a large chunk of the profits. Our organization also provides creators with new ways to monetize their work, such as through NFTs and fan token offerings, creating new forms of revenue streams that were previously unavailable.\n\nLike the Nouns, at W3BSTOCK, we're not just speculating about the possibilities of blockchain technology - we're making it a reality. This is why we believe that a partnership like this would represent such a mutual value and bear very long term fruit for the Nouns and independent creators across the globe. \n\nI believe that one of the core focuses in our shared goal of proliferation the Nouns DAO should be empowering creators, and what better way than to proliferate Nouns to artists and musicians? These are the truest arbiters of culture. Musicians and artists say what is cool, they define culture. We get leading web3 artists and musicians rocking the Nouns brand ... and the world will follow. \n\nBy getting involved with W3BSTOCK, we'll be at the forefront of a music, art, and creator revolution, disrupting the outmoded music industry and creating a more equitable future for all involved. \n\nThank you for considering this proposal, and here's to a brighter future for music, art and the world!\n\n## Team \n\n* **Brian Stollery** - Hi!

We received coverage from [**Animation Magazine**](https://www.animationmagazine.net/2023/03/stoopid-buddy-teams-with-nouns-dao-to-fund-nft-inspired-short-shorts/) and have a simple [**Nouns Stories**](http://nounsstories.wtf/) website with further links.\n\n5 of these animators were selected through our [**Prop House round**](https://prop.house/nouns-stories/nouns-short-shorts-season-1), which is now complete. We had 67 wildly talented applicants offering a variety of animation styles: 2D, 3D, stop motion, mixed media. The Prop House link has all of the submissions, including the 5 winners.\n\nAt the same time, our team commissioned 5 additional animators from our personal networks. We are excited to announce them - they are fantastic animators with significant careers and social followings. After this proposal we will announce all animators together in a press release.\n\nBoth the Prop House round and commissions have successfully caught the attention of world-class animators. We are onboarding some very talented people to Nouns, even helping some set up their first crypto wallets. It feels like we've hit on something special.\n\n## FUNDING MORE SHORT SHORTS\n\nMany great creators applied to the Prop House round and selecting only 5 was a challenge. We would love to fund a few additional Short Shorts from this pool of talent, as well as commission some more from our own networks. This extra animated content will be very useful for the IRL film festival we're planning.\n\nWe're looking for $52,500 USDC to fund 7 more animations:\n\n - 5 additional Prop House shorts ($7500 USDC x 5)\n - 2 additional comissioned shorts ($7500 USDC x 2)\n\n## HOSTING IRL FESTIVAL IN LA\n\nExcited by the caliber of animators, we would like to rent a venue in Los Angeles and host an IRL festival event. The organizing team has significant connections in the LA Animation / Film industries and we plan to invite our professional networks, friends, and the general public to enjoy some Short Shorts and learn about Nouns.

Let's keep the momentum going! This is our opportunity at becoming a globally recognized legacy brand in esports.\n\n\n## Description\n\nOur aim is for Nouns DAO to become a tier one, legacy esports brand. To achieve that, we need to consistently support our top-tier professional esports teams. This proposal ensures ongoing financial backing and assistance for our teams during the 2023 season, enabling us to continue cultivating an impactful esports brand and fostering strong community support around it.\n\n#### **Why Esports?**\n- Global Audience\n    - 100,000+ regular viewers of the Nouns brand each month across multiple games\n    - 250,000+ hours watched of esports competitions, player streams, etc. featuring Nouns branding\n- Developing a community with passionate supporters and fans, providing a gateway to the broader Nouns ecosystem\n- Empower aspiring esports athletes with our organization's support and representation to excel professionally\n\n#### **Esports Pod Update** \n- Operating since [Proposal 119](https://nouns.wtf/vote/119)\n- Effectively managed the budget allocated by the DAO more details at [funds.nouns.gg](http://funds.nouns.gg/)\n    - Protected against ETH downturn over the last 7 months by converting ETH @ ~1650 in August to provide stability to players and org\n    - Currently maintaining a treasury of approximately $180k in USDC and ETH, with a significant portion already designated for approved proposals\n    - Upheld only using a maximum of 10% for operations\n        - We did one round of retrofunding for the past 7 months, with an average of ~$2900 total per contributor (distributed 60490 USDC among 21 contributors).\n- Attracting a multitude of partnership opportunities \n    - Esports native businesses who want to build with Nouns e.g. [WePlay Proposal 198](https://nouns.wtf/vote/198)\n    - Invited to a prestigious tournament circuit hosted by the world's leading esports company, featuring 16 elite teams, where each participating organization can earn up to $100K in incentives\n\n#### **Pod Success Stories**\n- Impressive performances and improvement from our teams & players\n    - Multiple tournament wins and Top 8 finishes\n    - Qualifying for some of the biggest events in the world\n- Over the past six months, we have supported [Aklo](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Smasher:Aklo), the world's 16th ranked Super Smash Bros. Melee player. Our assistance has enabled him to participate in a greater number of tournaments across the nation, and he has served as a commendable and positive ambassador for Nouns\n    - Check out the hype plays and skill from our [Aklo announcement video](https://twitter.com/nounsesports/status/1593699246636556288?s=20)\n    - *Witness when the crowd literally [carries Aklo out of the venue](https://twitter.com/nycmelee/status/1609379932714450944) after a big win in New York!*\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/4VrNR2P.jpg)](https://twitter.com/nycmelee/status/1609379932714450944)\n\n- We stepped in to sponsor a CS:GO team without financial backing, ensuring they could attend a crucial bootcamp ahead of one of their biggest events. Our support paid off when they competed in front of over 200,000 live viewers\n- Influencer Taki has gained a significant following on social media, including over 100,000 followers on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/soy_taki) and regularly streams to over a thousand people on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/soy_taki). Additionally, she has a substantial following on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/soy_takii) and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@soy_takii).

This tournament circuit is ran by ESL, the biggest esports company in the world. Our success at this event will allow us to participate in a 15 million dollar grand final later this year.\n![](https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/sDgIIzb2UMj-OTHG8G4POauhmFeRE95o3oartDmdi84/https/pbs.twimg.com/media/FrqIBzJWYAEvYSZ.jpg)\n\n**Blast Paris Major 2023 North American RMR** \nThe Counter Strike sticker opportunity. Our team is in Monterrey Mexico, competing against top teams from the Americas for a spot at the [Paris Major](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/BLAST/Major/2023/Paris) in May.\n\n**IEM Dallas**\nOur CSGO team has qualified for IEM Dallas starting May 29th. IEM Dallas is an S-Tier event just barely below a Major. It will pit Nouns against the worlds best international teams, with hundreds of thousands of viewers. 2022's iteration (pictured below) had over 12.5 million hours watched and a crowd seating thousands.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DmQCdf3.png)\n\n## Proposal Success Metrics & Vision\n\n- Tournament wins and participation\n    - Continuing to compete at some of the biggest tournaments in the world, such as Majors and The International\n- Viewership \n    - Due to the success of our teams we expect to be at significantly more tier one events than last year. Regular 10K to 100K+ viewership is expected\n    - The highest view count so far was 200.000+ live viewers during a nail-biting series against MiBR at the CS:GO NA RMR\n- Social media growth\n    - Approaching 7000 followers on our main Twitter account & multiple of our players have over 50k followers\n    - Discord server with 2400 members in total and a growing group of active contributors\n- In-game branding\n    - Dota will continue to have Nouns assets thanks to participation in the Pro Circuit\n    - In CS, we need to qualify for an upcoming Major, doing so would guarantee permanent Nounish branding inside of the game\n- Acquiring additional partners aligned to our Nounish ethos\n    - We'll seek partners that share our values and vision for long-term growth, prioritizing alignment with our Nounish ethos\n    -  Nouns Esports can have multiple sponsors supporting our competitive initiative, and we will prioritize aligning with sponsors that share our values and vision for long-term growth\n- Onboarding\n    - Gamers have typically been wary of the crypto space due to a lack of understanding and perceived complexity. However, the similarities between the gaming and crypto ecosystems, such as digital ownership and online communities, make them well-suited for each other\n    - Nounish culture extended into esports has proven to be an amazing onboarding tool and we believe we can bridge the gap between gaming and crypto, showing gamers the potential benefits of crypto and its applications in and beyond the gaming world\n\n\n## Risks and Challenges\n\nAs an organization, it's crucial to consider the potential risks associated with discontinuing support for our esports teams. These teams are not just a source of entertainment for the community but also a representation of our brand and values. If we abruptly stop supporting them, we risk losing the trust and loyalty of the community we have worked hard to build.\n\nAnother challenge that esports teams face is potential fluctuations in performance during the competitive season. To mitigate this risk, it's important to provide necessary support expected of tier one rosters, including management, coaching, bootcamps, and wellness support. This helps maintain the players' focus, discipline, and motivation, especially during challenging times.\n\n## Budget\n\nFunding two professional esports teams for a minimum of 10 months.\n\n#### **Rosters**\n- 340,000 - 465,000 USDC\n    - Two teams consisting of five players and one coach (12 people in total)\n    - 125000 reserved for incentive payments, meaning it will be reflexive of the performance and effort put forth by the teams\n\n#### **Bootcamps** \n- 20,000-120,000 USDC\n- Funding the best practice opportunities prior to important competitions\n     - Considered an essential need for top esports rosters\n     - Costs may be reduced depending on the number of sponsored bootcamps (e.g. our Dota team has already received a free bootcamp in Europe during April, paid for by the organizers)\n\n#### **Support Staff**\n- 210,000 USDC\n    - We are providing industry-standard support staff for these rosters\n        - Two player managers who travel to events with the teams & organize their lives around regular competition\n        - Professional wellness staff \n        - Support staff for logistics, social media & content\n\n#### **Total: 795,000 USDC** (~435 ETH at current prices)\n---\n### **Multisig**\n\nWe will be using the same multisig that was created for [Proposal 119](https://nouns.wtf/vote/119) consisting of Nouners and Nounsfolk.

Better design plan below.]\n\n---\n\nAs one of the primary means of interacting with our online world, keyboards are more than just a tool – they've become a personal expression. Until Neuralink becomes available, let's design a keyboard that we love to use every time!\n\nNextMech and I are excited to create a Nounish Mechanical Keyboard (MK) in collaboration with a top tier keyboard designers. With our internal MK knowledge and technical ability, we have planned a project that ultimately launches a Nouns sub-DAO for an enthusiastic subculture!\n\n### Overview\n\nOver the years, [an online subculture has emerged (partial MK ecosystem stats)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing) that cherishes their custom keyboards as works of art. This community has developed its own workflow called the group buy, where artists share designs for collectors to pre-order. After pooling the funds, the designer approaches a vendor to manufacture and deliver the product. Similar to web3, projects are decentralized across social media and different websites, [and they also have meetups around the world](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query)! Using the existing manufacturing infrastructure, we can improve the UX by utilizing NFTs, DAOs, and open-source software, to bridge the two communities!\n\n![MK_meet](https://i.imgur.com/p8ph93F.jpg)\n[SF meet March 5th 2023 with a photoshoped Nouns MK - [original photo](https://twitter.com/villi/status/1632132746029182977)]\nOther meetups can be seen by searching for [\"mechanical keyboard meet\"](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query).\n\n### Us\n\nNextMech and I (profish) began working on a project called Mechies which won a small prize in a 2022 Australian hackathon. We thought about MK NFTs in the form of generative art with manufacturable traits, DAOs as Vendors for group buys, hardware-embedded signatures, etc., to help improve the ecosystem. Then, at the beginning of this year, we were introduced to [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami) through a buildoors group in Australia. He told us about the profound model of Nouns, and it quickly became clear that a collaboration would help proliferate the brand and support the MK subculture. His tremendous support and knowledge has helped shape a sustainable plan for this project!\n\n### Nouns x MKs\n\nThe proliferation synergizes immediately with existing channels. For example, the Nouns Esports team could incorporate the keycaps in their battle stations which would reach gaming spectators - expression of support have been made for collaboration. Or, Nouns keycaps can be given as POAPs to hackathon participants and winners, Nouns keyboards would be taken to keyboard meet ups around the world, photos of Nouns keyboards and keycaps will be showcased on popular online forum with millions of visitors, and so on. But we plan to go further than these channels and use Zora's Nouns Builder to create a MK DAO and continue to support MK enthusiasts!\n\n### Future\n\nThe MK DAO and the general infrastructure supported by this grant can become a platform that improves group buys for designers and collectors. Designers can leverage NFTs to offer their work as mints. They can go further by turning their existing Discord communities into DAOs, where the community can have greater input and ownership in the products they purchase. Also, the collectors who mint these designs benefit from the social media integration of NFTs, for better showcasing of their collections. In fact, we have already begun curating this platform by commissioning different MK artists in the current process, with many more collaborations in the pipeline!\n\nAlso, a long-term experiment that we are considering involves addressing IP issues in the ecosystem. [Designers face a challenge in protecting their intellectual property (IP) when running group buys](https://www.theverge.com/22905351/mechanical-keyboard-keycap-clones-imitators-knockoffs-olivia-biip). While stopping counterfeits for keycaps and general products is very difficult, authenticating the keyboards may be feasible. By using [VIA, an open-source software integrated with all keyboards](https://www.caniusevia.com/) and working with manufacturers, we could link keyboards to NFTs for potentially increasing their social and monetary value for collectors.\n\n### Summary Plan\n\nWe will work with a top tier MK designer and manufacture the keyboards for the NFT minters. We aim to sell and manufacture 1-2k units with a unique marketing strategy that involves selling keycaps of various sorts to complement the keyboard. This provides an incentive for us to proliferate Nouns, reduce prices and gather foundational members for the MK DAO!\n\nFinally, the entirety of this project will be a great example of real-world adoption for NFTs, especially with the new [EIPs for physical NFTs](https://medium.com/@ABCDE.com/abcde-after-studying-all-eips-we-summarized-9-future-directions-of-nfts-648c11f16a4f). It will be a major win for Nouns to be early and supportive of a devoted subculture that is growing! Take, for example, the subscriber count for the /r/MechanicalKeyboards subreddit:\n![MK_subreddit_stats](https://i.imgur.com/ynIRz2l.png)\n[Here is a small data set that we have gathered on the ecosystem to provide more context.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**With that said, here is a simple cost breakdown to make it all possible. We have already begun tracking expenses in our Notion and will continue to do so for the rest of the project. If there is a surplus we will allocate to other productive activities that further the project. More detailed breakdown and Q&A at the end:**\n\n- 52 ETH for manufacturing setup of however many mints but a guaranteed amount of 260 units including buffer, prototypes and YouTuber review units. With couple hundred spare keycap sets.\n- 10 ETH for assembling (80+ hours of labor), storage until redemption and safe high priority shipping.\n- 21.69 ETH for marketing of digital and physical assets including keycap airdrops of various different types.\n- 35 ETH for team and contractors, managing production, technical, graphics and starting/supporting the MK DAO.\n\n**Total - 118.69 ETH**\n\n---\n---\n## Detailed Plan\nCustom keyboard manufacturing involves two main components: the case and keycap set. Switches and other components are also significant, but they are less customizable; therefore, we will simply use enthusiast-grade products. For a more detailed overview of mechanical keyboards, [check out this intro made by NextMech](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gRH83pF1RBXW6Eve_OLC9Fb7hAlxQQEP/view?usp=sharing).\n\nTo start, a designer will incorporate the Nouns brand into the keyboard canvas. We are considering a collaboration with several designer who can create an aesthetic Nouns-themed keyboard. These designers can combine the MK culture and Nouns brand for a pleasing design. These include [BIIP](https://instagram.com/biipmk), [NoPunIn10Did](https://nopunin10did.com/kat-napoleonic/), [sourmk](https://www.instagram.com/sourmk), pikku-allu, dededecline who would be able to combine different themes into their work. Also, a design by a top artist plays a major role for introducing Nouns to the MK community, ensuring a high-quality product that enthusiasts will enjoy. Here are some of the works by the mentioned designers:\n\n![biip_dots](https://i.imgur.com/6WupSai.jpg)\n[BIIP Dots]\n![Pikku_allu](https://i.imgur.com/EsoOGd7.jpg)\n[Pikku Allu Symbiote]\n![nopunin10did](https://i.imgur.com/mNWDioS.jpg)\n[nopunin10did DSS Late Harvet]\n![sourmk_dandy](https://i.imgur.com/fJDs1nY.jpg)\n[Sourmk Dandy]\n\nFor manufacturing, our first choice is a company that builds based on their available catalog of cases and can also assist with packaging and shipping. However, for a better quality design, we are prepared to carry out a more bespoke model by working with different suppliers. NextMech has experience with both approaches and after accounting for trade-offs and constraints, we are confident on delivering a high quality product. The bespoke approach will start at a higher unit cost, but it's still within the financial plan. Also, it's well worth trading off additional costs for a better design!\n\nAfter finalizing the design, we will begin reviewing prototypes from the manufacturer(s) to confirm the colors and build quality. This will give us the confidence to replicate the design as an NFT, one that will be minted through after a project update. The mint will be priced at approximately 0.3-0.4 ETH depending on final unit cost and ETH price, with a discount for Nouns holders which brings price to near cost. It will have boolean-based redemption on [nouns.mk](https://nouns.MK) since we don't want to burn the NFT so that it can be shared online, and also allows for over the air updates through VIA software.\n\nPrior to and during the minting of the NFTs, we will launch marketing efforts to increase the visibility of the project. Proliferating the brand through community activity which also aligns with our incentive to reduce unit costs. A portion of the mint will be used to help start the MK DAO built using Zora's Noun Builder. We will support the MK DAO by managing further collaboration and manufacturing processes. Also, in addition to the daily auctions for the DAO, people who participated in the physical marketing events will gain access some access to the DAO.\n\nYou can start participating by [minting the momento NFT](https://zora.co/collections/0xbe11ce87505d41b6848f37cba26820d89b060a3e) where the glasses will be [magnetic](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp0Q-juJ-_Y/?img_index=1)! Some participants will win this with their keyboard!\n[![noun_keycap_board](https://i.imgur.com/06G1uuC.png)](https://zora.co/collections/0xbe11ce87505d41b6848f37cba26820d89b060a3e)\n\nThe physical marketing is in the style of MK communities, which will be on in addition to the digital media marketing. We are working on various exciting strategies for minters; some include resin keycaps with 3D Nouns characters inside, two piece magnetic and modular keycaps, novelty keycaps with Nouns themes, high-quality metallic keycaps, a fully custom 1/1 keyboard made for auction, hackathon POAP keycaps redeemed in person and more MK designer and influencer collaborations! These will have various pricing mechanisms to maximize accessibility for collectors and start the MK DAO.\n\nHere are some examples (not a real design) of a Nouns keycap NFT for physical marketing, which can be redeemed in the same way as the main keyboard NFT. It's a great addition to the custom keyboard once it arrives, or it allows MK enthusiasts to join the community with their existing keyboard!\n\n![noun_keycap_board](https://i.imgur.com/xON1kBh.jpg)\n![noun_keycap_board](https://i.imgur.com/FFxttkm.png)\n[Not a real design, for conceptualization of single keycap only - by boardbay]\n\nOnce manufacturing, assembly, and quality testing are complete, the NFTs can be redeemed. They will be stored with a distributor or manufacturer and can be redeemed at any time. It is possible to sell the NFTs prior to redeeming them. \n\n### Current Progress\nAll progress will be made public on our Notion page, where we keep info that is up to date. Here are some highlights from the current progress:\n- Talking to two manufacturers and shared general idea to confirm production and timeline feasibility.\n- In contact with mentioned designers and discussing collaboration terms.\n- Quotes and plans on keycap marketing with various designers.\n- Registered [Nouns.mk](http://Nouns.mk), twitter account [@nounsmk](https://twitter.com/nounsmk), [nounsmk.eth](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth%3A0x144975eEc9674fd0Af3d6F3FBa8D660879cE3881) and nounsmkdao.eth.\n- Project outline and public workspace for the entirety of the project, with more details to be added as the project progresses.\n\n## Team and our MKs!\n**[Profish](https://twitter.com/profishcrypto) (product)**: My past experience is software engineering work for crypto trading companies and tokenomic simulations in cadCAD. Also, as part of the DAO Under community, I've project managed the build of a DAO framework to support crypto builders in Australia.\n\n**[NextMech](https://instagram.com/next.mech) (MK expert)**: Michael runs a boutique custom MK business and has a deep understanding of the industry. Additionally, as a full-stack developer, he can effectively plan with the constraints of a physical NFT projects!\n\nHelping us will be **Joy Chiang (artist)**: She has helped some of the most successful NFT projects in Australia and has a family of MK enthusiasts!\n\n![team-MK](https://i.imgur.com/nEN1vIF.jpg)\n\n## Detailed Phases (8-12 months)\n\nThese are the major phases in the project and the estimated timeline. The building and marketing phase will be ongoing as the keycaps are mini NFT projects for the community. [Here is an early view of the timeline in our Notion, we will make it more accurate as we progress through the stages.](https://www.notion.so/5046938e65264b02b9d86c117289b98e).\n\n### Phase 1: Design\n- Start momento manufacturing for two piece magnetic keycap\n- Start commissions on physical marketing assets (1/1 keyboards, keycaps, NFC keycap, designer collab, keyboard head nouns for MK DAO, etc.)\n- Work with designer to finalize design (also communicating with manufacturer for feasibility)\n- Replicate keyboard design as an NFT\n- Update [Nouns.mk](http://Nouns.MK) with final design and soft launch\n- Update task board and add more detailed overview given new information\n\n### Phase 2: Marketing\n\n- Release mint of redeemable keyboard NFT\n- Digital marketing assets based on keyboard design\n- Continuation of physical marketing\n- Gather designers and collectors for MK DAO\n\n### Phase 3: Build\n\n- [Nouns.mk](http://Nouns.MK) update for redemption process and collection view\n- Ongoing build of NFT smart contract for physical marketing assets\n- Beginning MK DAO design and implementation for existing community\n- Exploring VIA experiment for 1/1 keyboard\n\n### Phase 4: Delivery\n\n- Manufactured, packaged and begin shipping for redemption\n- Online launch events and plan in person launch event\n- Small gatherings at existing MK meetups and crypto conferences\n- Launching MK DAO\n\n![timeline](https://i.imgur.com/Ox4IW82.png)\n\n\n## Detailed Costs (8-12 month project)\n\nThese are the costs with a small margin of error to account for challenges that arise during physical goods manufacturing. But we aim to be efficient and transparent with the budget in our Notion. The ETH is transferred to mechies.eth which has 3/4 threshold including Profish, NextMech, Zaak (from Zora) and Gami.\n\n### Manufacturing - 52 ETH\n\n- Tooling setup for a minimum of 200 units at approx. 400 USD depending on design complexity. Aiming for 1-2k units to reduce unit cost to 300.\n- 100-200 keycap sets only for future sale.\n- 15% supply buffer for quality control issues (but they will be available for selling when we see that there are no issues with the supply)\n- 4 units for prototypes 0.7 ETH each (including shipping)\n- Tooling setup for manufacturing (case layout, colours, materials, testing, handling supply chain, etc)\n- Post manufacturing processes such as etching, quality checks, and assembling\n- Remaining parts such as PCBs, switches, frames, screws, badges, etc.\n\n### Delivery - 10 ETH\n\n- Assembling and Packaging\n- Storing in warehouse until shipment\n- Shipping with insurance (priority DHL for example) in case of damages or lost property so we can compensate the NFT holder or retry\n\n### Marketing - 21.69 ETH\n\n- Digital assets such as videos, gifs, 3D renders for social media\n- Manufacturing cost of physical marketing assets for give away and raffles\n    - 100 to 200 super custom keycaps: 3D resin, 2 piece keycaps, handmade interactive keycaps, etc.\n    - 400 to 600 Artisan keycaps: basic metallic, infill metallic, plastic, basic resin, CNC etc.\n    - 1/1 fully custom keyboard to be auctioned\n    - Simple keycaps and NFC chipped keycaps as POAPs for hackathons\n    - Novelty keys for the main keycap set\n- Marketing units sent to YouTube and twitch influencers for review\n- Misc: post manufacturing skins, digital art commission, social media posts, etc.\n- Hosting launch event and keyboard meetups \n\n### Team - 35 ETH\n\n- 16 ETH - Managing the project across manufacturing, marketing, tech, admin, community,  subcontractors, delivery, etc.\n- 7 ETH - Website development and tech infrastructure for minting and collecting, open source forks such as Builder DAO and VIA\n- 6 ETH - Designer commissions for MK design and manufacturing spec (CAD files)\n- 4 ETH - graphics, branding assets and website design \n- 2 ETH - misc fees such as gas, spreads, SAAS services, smart contracts, retro costs etc.\n\n**Total - 118.69 ETH**\n\n![MK_heads](https://i.imgur.com/KFLtMUX.png)\n[potential auction art for MK DAO - by instagram@keebpixel artist]\n\n\n## Short Q&A\n\n- **How much is the NFT mint?** Approximately 0.3-0.4 ETH. Nouns holders will receive a discount which brings the price close to cost. We aim to make it affordable by keeping manufacturing reasonable and reduce margin by increasing units. The marketing assets will vary in the form of free, free mint-to-win, at cost, at profit, auctions, free scan to keep and more.\n- **How expensive are MKs?** Custom mechanical keyboards by reputable designers can go upwards of 800-1000 USD. Production is constrained due to the tooling overhaul process, which makes the product rare. Also, NFT feature on top add to that value as we experiment with VIA.\n- **How does the redemption work?** Sharing pictures of MKs online is important, and having an NFT to share is even better. Once you redeem, the NFT becomes non-transferable. Also, it allows for over the air updates through the VIA software for lighting, macros, sounds, etc.\n- **Will the keyboards be assembled?** It is common for the manufacturer to send unassembled keyboards. Assembly is quite easy, as all the components are plug-ins, so if they don't assemble it, we will either work with a distributor or assemble them ourselves. We are even considering an option where the NFT holder can chose between these two options, since the assembling process is part of the experience. However, it's too early to tell if that will be possible.\n- **How long does it take to deliver?** Usually around 10-12 months from the proposal passing to delivery. Keycap sets can sometimes take up to 3 years to deliver, but we are going to make sure that doesn't happen. Also, we think we can shorten this time for future iterations in the MK DAO.\n- **How big is the MK community?** You'd be surprised who likes MK since it doesn't come up in conversation. The forums and Discord servers of designers are similar to or, bigger in size and activity compared to crypto communities. Although, it is pretty scattered online, but I have made a [spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing) to provide some context.\n- **Will there be a sub DAO?** We aim to start one, since there is so much you can do as a community. For example, new keycap styles come out every year, so the DAO can continue commissioning collabs with any theme. We will airdrop supporters, including Nouns to join the MK DAO.\n\n![nouns_MK_samples](https://i.imgur.com/N25XTBo.png)\n[illustration renders of keyboard designs]\n\n---\n---\n#### Relevant links\n\n- Project Notion: [https://mechies.notion.site/Enter](https://mechies.notion.site/Enter-e9a095646e2b49978751c10df85aa12a)\n- Nouns MK site: [nouns.mk](http://Nouns.MK)\n- Nouns MK twitter: [twitter.com/nounsmk](https://twitter.com/nounsmk)\n- Twitter: [twitter.com/mechiesnft](https://twitter.com/mechiesnft)\n- Next.Mech: [instagram.com/next.mech/](https://www.instagram.com/next.mech/)\n- Intro to Mechanical Keyboards: [drive.google.com/file/d/mk_intro](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gRH83pF1RBXW6Eve_OLC9Fb7hAlxQQEP/view?usp=sharing)\n- Small view of the MK landscape: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/mk_eco_data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing)\n- Twitter search for Mechanical Keyboard Meetups: [meetup tweets](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query)\n\n![nouns_MK_samples](https://i.imgur.com/JJtVLr3.png)\n[illustration render of keyboard components]"},{"blockNumber":17020850,"blockHash":"0x46e6f69b50eb1a3b4e1bc1ef16b4e7e3e5c24477b5c7c07ab28a34612e73d128","transactionIndex":73,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x7e2dab5110a6813255c660cbcc135b1da413d7116b93fb6f97980cb798b161d4","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":267,"proposer":"0x93D94557824AC07A30b5B0f44f7CB3E00f9c4191","targets":["0x93D94557824AC07A30b5B0f44f7CB3E00f9c4191"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":17056850,"endBlock":17092850,"description":"# Explorer Grants\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**\nExplorer Grants is coming off a successful pilot, finding and funding five great people. We learned a lot of what worked, and what didn’t. We are asking to be trusted with more capital to bring more talented builders into the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nWe would like to run two more rounds of grants, as well as invest further in the project to attract more talented builders to the Nouns ecosystem through Explorer Grants.\n\n\n## Pilot Round Recap\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RMqi2Xs.jpg)\n \n\n_What our Explorers have done:_\n\n\n* [Greg](https://twitter.com/gregskril) - built Prop 249 (Solo Staking), built the Nouns API, and NounsList\n* [Drew](https://twitter.com/drewcoffman) - created valuable content about Nouns, crafted a thoughtful video and TikToks, gained Nouns delegation from Wilson and has been voting with reason consistently.\n* [Jackson](https://twitter.com/jackson_felty) - created cookbook.dev/nouns, running a workshop on how to build on Nouns\n* [Tigris](https://twitter.com/tigrisli) - built many, many, prototypes, wrapping up a proposal for Nouns hardware going on-chain after this!\n* Our fifth explorer had to put the grant on pause due to unforeseen work coming up. We are hopeful we can restart their grant or use it for someone else in the second pilot round.\n\nWhat we learned:\n\n\n\n- Grants are an excellent marketing tool for the DAO; by leaning into the funds that we were given, we were able to beat the record of applicants to a Nouns Prop House Round (90) and build a sizable following outside of Nouns, despite no previous traction. **_Therefore, every $ of the grants was used for two purposes: marketing the grant and the actual grant._** If the grants were smaller, we would have gotten less applicants.\n- There are amazing people waiting to be Nouns-pilled who just need a bit of help. Just in our first round, we had to reject amazing applicants who could have contributed great things to Nouns and just needed a bit of help. \n- We probably won’t get people to leave their jobs with large Explorer Grants (some of you can say _“I told you so!”_ here). We got few applicants with full-time jobs, and participants who were not tied down to other responsibilities were often able to go deeper on Nouns. ***We want to give alternative, smaller Explorer Grants to talented builders who have other commitments, paired with hands-on support.***\n- Bringing people into Nouns takes time and effort - a lot of the people we talked to weren’t available at the moment, and ***building connections with prospective explorers takes time.*** This is similar to executive headhunting - not as straightforward as finding someone and giving them money.\n- ***Hack Week*** was a lot of fun and a great success with 90 ETH deployed, hundreds of participants, and dozens of new contributors to our community!\n\n## Goals for this round\n\n***Our #1 priority is to continue bringing top talent into Nouns.***  We want to fund 5x as many builders while maintaining the quality of the Pilot Round - we have an ongoing list of people who were highly interested but unavailable during our original application period. We’ll continue our main grants by doing two cycles of 6 grants of 6 ETH each. We may also use Prop House’s infinite rounds to run part of our smaller Explorer Grants, which Nouners will be voting on. \n\nOther objectives:\n\n\n\n- **Re-invest into the EG talent pipeline:** build out a community, build out a strong decentralized brand for Explorer Grants, and create content that brings in more talent from outside of Nouns. This will require paying people outside of the main team.\n- **Contribute to the Nouns dev ecosystem:** we ran Nouns Hack Week and would like to continue efforts like it, build out content for Nouns builders as a whole, and be stewards of Nouns contributors. \n- **Participate in governance:** we’d like 1 Noun to support Explorers and Builders (we are currently paying for delegation). This also doubles as an equity-like payment to the Explorer Grants team so that we can share in the upside of Nouns. None of us own Nouns.\n\n### Ask\n* Grants: 100 ETH\n    * Regular (via application cycles): 12 x 6 = 72 ETH\n    * Small (via Infinite Rounds + by team): 14 x 2 ETH = 28 ETH\n* Growth / Reinvesting - Community, Content, Brand, Operational: 10 ETH\n* Team Compensation: 15 ETH / month for six months\n* 1 Noun\nTotal: 200 ETH + 1 Noun"},{"blockNumber":17027814,"blockHash":"0x1378812c9c73ff0bf2e15e2a85a0f35dbedfe6bccc259b1cc52466c38f01617b","transactionIndex":81,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x0f9c7a7eddd89c2eef04801d0dcd0e352ff509dad58871a822b6d6a8ce304e9d","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":268,"proposer":"0x13eEf4EF8FCa471f242ab0F8F49A3dB6017aDA33","targets":["0x5a2DA0F09d65a0034F4398BdA40df4F8A79a3293"],"signatures":["clone(address,address,address,(uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,address))"],"calldatas":["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"],"startBlock":17063814,"endBlock":17099814,"description":"# Nouns Autobidder Trial (by Federation)\n\n![auctionbidder.png](https://i.postimg.cc/FzfRFjyD/auctionbidder.png)\n\n## TLDR\n\nThis proposal deploys a Federation AutoBidder to purchase Nouns at auction for use in future proposals. \n\nThe AutoBidder will be funded with 31 ETH, which will allow the community to trial the AutoBidder with minimal risk and acquire 1 Noun for the treasury.\n\n## AutoBidder\n\nAutoBidder is a contract for trustlessly bidding on Nouns at auction. It can be configured with settings that define how it can bid: MinBid, MaxBid, Tip, BidWindow, and the recipient of Nouns won.  Once configured, anyone can submit a transaction to force the contract to bid. Calling `bid()` refunds gas and rewards the caller with a small tip, ensuring the AutoBidder consistently runs.\n\nThis Nouns AutoBidder will be deployed with the following settings: \n\n- MinBid: `30 ETH` \n- MaxBid: `30 ETH`\n- BidWindow: `24 hours`\n- Tip: `0.001 ETH` (tip is an incentive for anyone to kick off a bid)\n- Receiver: `0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10` (treasury)\n- Contract Balance: `31 ETH`\n\nThese settings will allow the AutoBidder to place a bid of 30 ETH whenever a new\nauction starts until funds are exhausted or the contract is paused.\n\nMore info can be found on how the AutoBidder works here: [Github Repository](https://github.com/nounish/autobidder)\n\n## Currently used by\n\n[Lil Nouns prop #115](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/115) deployed v0.1 of AutoBidder for Lil Nouns to extend their\nacquisition of Nouns. \n\nWizards followed suit, deploying v0.2 of AutoBidder (which extends v0.1 with support for setting ENS reverse records).\n\n**Links to

Gnarly EP\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pW1Lxnj.png)\n\n**Gnarly EP** is a three track release by [Lil Bubble](https://twitter.com/thecryptobubble), an extremely nounish recording artist and Gnars DAO member. These original songs were commissioned [by Gnars for 3 ETH](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0xbb73acb16a3b968a7cde352cf046b7d015b0dde0bce3a6d16355d28cf9d519e8) and this droposal marks our official [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) release of the music and cover art. \n\n---\n\n## ⚡️ TLDR\n\n- Gnarly EP is a 3 track CC0 release\n- Extremely nounish originals by Lil Bubble\n- Attached txs deploy Zora timed open editions\n- Droposal only with no funding requested\n- Nouns get 10% of mint proceeds\n\n---\n\n## 👨‍🚀 Introduction\n\nLil Bubble is an established Web3-native character who has been releasing satirical songs and music videos for the community since 2019. His songs and remixes put a tongue-in-cheek spin on market events and have clocked **OVER 10 MILLION VIEWS**, adding to the cultural fabric of the space with a comedic blend of music, video and niche subject matter.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/5EwyJEF.jpg)](https://twitter.com/TheCryptoBubble/status/1587404329262030849)\n\nHis engaged crypto-centric audience and alignment with Nounish values (using creative remixes and finely-crafted memes to contribute to Web3 culture) make Lil Bubble a great asset to Nouns. He has been a strong supporter and participant in the Nouns community - has featured Nouns in a previous music video, was one of the earliest members and supporters of Gnars DAO, has been a special guest in a number of Noun Square Twitter spaces, and is currently working on his own Nouns fork.\n\n## ⭐️ Previous Nounish Work\n\nLil Bubble featured Noun 189 and owner [Gami](https://gami.wtf) in a music video in August last year. A custom Noun skateboard was featured in the video which was shared widely throughout the community garnering over 370k impressions and 145k video views on Twitter alone.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5ZkITFM.jpg)\n\nLil Bubble grew up skateboarding and his continued support of Gnars DAO has helped us broaden our collector base. The three tracks produced for this EP have made a huge impact on our community, with \"Never Gonna Grow Up\" having already found its place as our anthem. \n\n## 🚀 Launch Plan\n\nEach of the three tracks are being released as timed open editions. You can [listen to them now](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/sets/gnarly-ep-1/s-hEnIvXqxQ1A) on SoundCloud by clicking the embedded players below.

Owner will be set to gnars.eth following drop.*\n\n## 📝 Artist Remarks\n\nAs one of the first members of Gnars DAO it was fun to finally make some music for my favourite crew! There were a few elements to incorporate into the EP - Gnarly skate references, up-beat Nounish vibes, 8bit sound design, and Lil Bubble's signature crypto moonboy motif. I wanted each song to be a different style to keep things interesting. \n\n### Never Gonna Grow Up\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/iz4QGdx.jpg)](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/never-gonna-grow-up/s-tNxMPjzxvJN)\n\nThis is my interpretation of Gnars (and by extension Nouns). Skateboarding played a big role in my childhood so being able to re-ignite that passion with Gnars sparks all kinds of youthful nostalgia. Connecting with a new group of people in adulthood and engaging, building and creating together in new ways gives me that same feeling. I'm never gonna grow up!\n\n### Blast Off \n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/6sM9fSe.jpg)](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/blast-off/s-gIVZEDQB0wY)\n\nThis is probably my favourite instrumental on the EP. The trap beat and super simple 8bit-inspired synths are very 'Lil Bubble' and a pretty good glimpse at the direction I'm taking things with my original music moving forward. Lots of Gnars references in the lyrics!\n\n### Level Up\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/biGY1Ck.jpg)](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/level-up/s-rnUMscL3a6K)\n\nI wanted to step the energy up in the final track, moving in a slightly more tribal direction (Gnars is about extreme sports after all). More skate references in the lyrics - spot the shoutout to celebrity Gnars DAO member Bob Burnquist! I tied things together with plenty of digital glitches and some classic Lil Bubble trader stories. Regardless of which Web3 camp you sit in, you would have no doubt grown familiar with the market cycles and how they affect us all in one way or another. Trading aside, we should always be trying to level up and improve some area of our lives. Like my kickflips...\n\n## 🎁 Bonus Extras\n\n**Bonus 1:** Collectors who mint all three singles to complete the set will unlock a free to claim Collector's Edition EP.

TL;DR**\n\nWe would like to seek funding of 192.4K USDC *(~99 ETH)* to keep maintaining & developing [archives.wtf](https://archives.wtf/) as the main archive center of Nouns DAO over the next 6 months (May '23-Oct '23). Our focus is to increase the current media contents of Nouns ecosystem with the support of software improvements & public goods tools together enhancing user experiences.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Proposal Summary**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FKYUjfp.jpg)\n\n### **Prop 176 Recap**\n\nOn December 3rd, we were [funded](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdd7e4d8a5fef6702f7e9c5b45db440ba7a6e00c0#internaltx) of 32.28 ETH ($42K) to build an archive center which stores & display all media contents of Nouns DAO's projects & artworks and all the memes proliferations.\n\n**In the past 4 months we have ;**\n\n1. [Archives.wtf](https://archives.wtf/) - built a reliable archive website from the ground up\n2. Built features ; [link to thread](https://twitter.com/thevoadz/status/1641034993798467593?s=20)\n* under any categories, you can search any related data within the page, eg ; **Nouns On-chain Proposal**\n    * prop number\n    * project title\n    * description\n    * builders/artists\n    * category\n* we enable **scroll, filter & search persistence** for better user navigation ( which stored on your device )\n* you can use **cmd+k / ctrl+k** for quick access to search in page\n* cc0 icon & download button\n3. As per 4/11/2023, we have gathered and archived ;\n* [Proposals](https://archives.wtf/props) ([On-chain](https://archives.wtf/props/onchain), [Prop House](https://archives.wtf/props/prop-house) & [NSFW](https://archives.wtf/props/nsfw-small-grants)) ; **611 proposals, 410 builders**\n* Contests by [Noun Square](https://archives.wtf/special), [4156](https://archives.wtf/nouns), [Gnars DAO](https://archives.wtf/subdao/gnars-dao), [Noadz](https://archives.wtf/noggles/noggles-art-contest) ; **606 artworks & entries, 326 artists**\n    * Nouniversary\n    * Nouns Holiday\n    * Nouns Mash-up\n    * Nouns Movies\n    * Nouns Sneakers\n    * Nouns Esports\n    * Nouns Space\n    * 100 Days of Nouns\n\n4.

Built a tool named [Uploadr](https://uploadr.app/) for quick data upload & storage to the Arweave network\n6. Organized & compiled full database in [Nouns Archive's Notion](https://voadz.notion.site/Nouns-Archive-da52f93301dd4ed59e5b876bd5151d93)\n\n**Feedbacks from the communities**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Rzlefqe.png)\n**Past reference**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7JC7JYU.png)\n\n---\n\n## **3. Project Goals For Upcoming 6 Months**\n\n### **The Key Challenges**\nFrom [Prop 176](https://nouns.wtf/vote/176) :\n\n* There isn't currently a main archive center that stores and display all datas like \n    * proposal progress images/videos\n    * end product images/videos/links/repo\n    * nounish artworks from contests, events\n    * cc0 contents & working files\n* It is difficult for new people to discover any nounish contents because it is dispersed everywhere, throughout Twitter, Instagram & other platforms unless they have their own website or media-oriented approach which uses apps like Youtube. Particularly from the perspective of those who do not fully comprehend the Nouns ecosystem and where they might find it.\n* There is no specific rule for proposers to update their project progress everyday, fortnightly, or once a month but we could encourage people to do that more often if we help to provide the right tools.\n* Some builders with huge outcomes but stucked with time constraint need an additional support to archive their outputs.\n\nAs a central resource platform, cross pollination is one of things needed. Some of the early builders require assistance with visibility. With the connected links that point people to each nounish projects and builders, we assist the public in finding them.\n\n### **The Strategies**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EKvVcFO.png)\n\n**Strategy 1 ; Curated submission form**\n\n* We want to build **a curated submission form** attached to the website which benefits from multiple touchpoints.\n* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) and could request to submit a new sub-category and additional contents to their existing proposals/details.\n* The forms will allow users to select their preferred category, status, type of house, round, etc. *(based on specific usage)*\n* User can check their submission history together with submission details *(eg; date, title & status)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zRGCmYR.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kYzeI8v.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AUrMjNR.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1rQXaEQ.png)\n\n---\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gVzs6Ih.png)\n\n**Strategy 2 ; Uploader**\n\n* We want to improvise an [uploader](https://uploadr.app/) with some new features which we have built for the past few months.\n* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) & it will be token gated focusing on Nouns ecosystem to use it for free ;\n    * Nounders\n    * Nouners\n    * Nounish Builders\n    * Sub DAOs\n    * Nouns' NFT Open Edition Holders / Droposals *(This Is Nouns, The Wizard's Hat etc)*\n* Anyone who has just got noun-pilled into the ecosystem and want to use it, they may choose from any of the available criteria above. This will gradually benefit the Nouns DAO ecosystem over time.\n* User can check their upload history together with the details *(eg; date, title & arweave link)*\n* The fee of the uploaded permanent data is included under **OpEx** in ***Budget***.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IoUQQkb.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KFIzROZ.png)\n\n---\n\n**Strategy 3 ; Tooling R&D**\n\n* We want to create and launch tooling research and development that will bring significant effect on the process and project's efficiency and for the DAO where everyone could benefit from it.\n* We will use the fund under **OpEx** in ***Budget***.\n\n**The strategies mentioned are what we are focused on so far, but they are subject to change along the way or the best recommendations from the community. There will be more along the journey.*\n\n### **Data Permanence**\n\n* We are using **Arweave** network to store all the datas due to its one time fee permanent storage and we want to use it exclusively for all storage going forward.\n* Currently, around **40%** of the datas are now saved on Arweave, with the remaining **60%** being processed. *(Currently on Notion)*\n* There have been a few instances where artists or builders have discontinued their hosting and lost their tracks; this is something we do not want to happen again.\n* We want to make sure all datas of Nouns ecosystem are permanently stored in a decentralised manner and is always accessible.\n* We are able to boost the website's performance with the help of **Vercel Edge Network** which offers image optimization, page load speed & automatically data cached on the network.\n* The cost of uploading will be factor in under **OpEx** as per attached in ***Budget***.\n* Publish monthly data report of [archives.wtf ](https://archives.wtf/) for public reference.\n* All compiled datas are stored in [Nouns Archive's notion](https://voadz.notion.site/Nouns-Archive-da52f93301dd4ed59e5b876bd5151d93).\n\n### **RSS Feed**\n\nUtilising a simplified and condensed data feed can be more efficient than navigating through an entire website for the required information, making data feed crucial for individual use cases. That is why we're adding feed as a new feature, to make it easier for you to access the data you need and achieve your goals more efficiently.\n\nWe will provide a few types of feed for the main & sub-category pages ;\n  * RSS feed - /rss.xml\n  * Atom  feed - /atom.xml\n  * JSON feed - /feed.json\n\nThe data we have gathered can be utilised by everyone in the ecosystem for their own unique purposes. For instance, a mini companion app can directly use the JSON feed to list all proposals in NSFW Small Grants.\n\n### **Analytics**\n\nWe believe data transparency is important for the DAO & community. We are using **Vercel's Web Analytics** to get detailed insights. It provides in-depth information about your website's visitors, new metrics like top pages, top referrers, and demographics including information on countries, operating systems, and browsers.\n\nAs of *29th March - 20th April 2023,*\n\n* Visitors & Page Views\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8LkuQZn.png)\n\n* Panels\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zPo4dKf.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EUNHjX6.png)\n\n### **Sustainability Strategy**\n\nThe main intention of this project is to provide long-term benefits for Nouns. It serves as main archive center that provides wide media contents all over Nouns ecosystem for public reference. Once the open-source repository is public, we will be able to observe other NFT communities with active builders & projects and who benefits from Nouns' product to use it such as ;\n\n**Possible Candidates**\n* Nouns' extension & derivatives\n* Meebits\n* On-Chain Monkey\n* UMA\n* TinyDinos\n* Anata\n\n### **What's next?**\n\nWe certainly have long-term goals with few phases as we wish to accomplish them gradually. We attempt to avoid by highlighting all of our future objectives in one specific proposal as it sounds overly ambitious as we aim to underpromise and over-deliver. We believe that this will provide long term values and benefits to the DAO. It may not be a direct ROI.\n\nSome ideas worth looking at ;\n1. Preservation of archive material ( physical & digital )\n2. Nouns Archive '23 ( Limited physical edition )\n3. Publications - zines/quarterly\n4. Archive Data Request\n5. Ticketed exhibition of Nouns Archive materials ( ROI to DAO )\n\n---\n\n## **4. Deliverables**\n\nTo be delivered over the next 6 months ;\n* Maintaining & developing [archives.wtf](https://archives.wtf/) with all existing & incoming database of medias & arts in Nouns' ecosystem for the next 6 months.\n* Curated submission form & uploader. *(under Strategy)*\n* Toolings R&D. *(under Strategy)*\n* Nouns Archive repository.\n* RSS Feed\n* Daily nounish post in randomly manner on our social media, [Nouns Archive](https://twitter.com/NounsArchive).\n\n**Short-term checklist** *( to be archived )*\n\n* [Nouns Museum](https://twitter.com/thenounsmuseum)\n* [InternatioNouns](https://twitter.com/InternatioNouns)\n* Nouns AI's Contest\n* Messhup's Cover Art\n\n**Long-term checklist** *( to be archived )*\n\n* Prop House (Other houses, eg ; [Lil Nouns](https://prop.house/lil-nouns), [Nouns Japan](https://prop.house/nouns-japan), [Nouns Builder](https://prop.house/builder) etc)\n* Nouns On-Chain Props\n* NSFW\n* The Noun Square\n* Nouns World\n* Nouns' POAP Art\n\n---\n\n## **5.

One day, he gets hold of a pair of glasses that let him call up Nouns, who are more than happy to use their Nounish powers to bring chaos and adventure into his life. But when a few careless words summon a threat to the Nouniverse, can Caden use the power of language to save the world?\n\nABOUT THE BOOK: The general vibe is Beverly Cleary’s “Ramona” series meets Norton Juster’s “The Phantom Tollbooth.” I’m aiming it at six-to-ten-year-olds, and it’ll be fairly light-hearted: no tragedies, no dead pets, just adventures as the strange and surreal world of the Nouniverse intersects with the everyday home and school life of Caden and his friends and family.\n\nI want this to be a book that kids will enjoy reading on their own and that adults will also have fun reading to them. I’m running it by my favourite eight-year-old as I go, to make sure that the vocabulary level is appropriate and that the whole thing is fun and entertaining to a bright kid.\n\nI’m linking the first two chapters here, as text and as an audio file of me reading them aloud. I’ve got five chapters written so far, out of a planned twelve, and I have a clear outline of how the story will proceed. I expect to release an additional chapter about every three weeks, which I’ll be posting at http://rookswater.blogspot.com. When the whole thing is out, I’ll do some final edits and put together the definitive edition in ebook form. At that time, I’ll post a separate proposal for launching the ebook as a timed open edition mint event.\n\nAudio:\nhttps://youtu.be/_-usP1Qe78c\n\nChapter 1:\nhttps://rookswater.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-nominal-hero-ch-1.html\n\nChapter 2:\nhttps://rookswater.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-nominal-hero-ch-2.html\n\nTHE ASK: I’m requesting 25 ETH. This is for two things. First, to cover my living expenses for the next six months to let me focus on finishing the book. Second, I will be placing the book in the public domain immediately; this means that, unlike with a traditionally published book, I won’t be able to sell things like foreign-language rights, reprint rights, film option rights, and so forth. So this is partly to compensate for the lack of those future revenue streams, which normally provide traditionally published authors with a significant part of our ongoing income.\n\nI’d like to stream this amount over the course of six months. I’ve put up the first two chapters here, I’ll post the third right away on acceptance of this proposal, and then I’ll be posting a new chapter every three weeks, so in just about six months the whole book will be available. I’ll provide the final edited book in .epub and .pdf formats no more than one month after the last chapter is posted.\n\nABOUT TASHA K. ROOKSWATER: Under another name, I’m an author of science fiction and fantasy, primarily short stories and novellas. I’m enjoying the freedom of writing something completely different under this pseudonym. \n\nI’m a newcomer to crypto, but I’m fascinated by the artistic potential of this space. I love the public-domain aspect of Nouns and I’m looking forward to other people building on Caden’s story. I’m a big believer in fanfiction and the collaborative nature of storytelling, and I’m excited to send this book out into the world and see what comes back.\n\nProposer notes:\n \nTasha is a published science fiction author and IRL associate that I introduced to Nouns.

The festival was founded over 25 years ago by J.D. and his collaborators.\n\nAdditionally, this proposal aims to refine the playbook for onboarding established communities into the Nouns ecosystem and web3, empowered through a Nounish development hub, and including the introduction of **WarpedDAO.** \n\nIntroducing Nouns to millions of people and empowering communities to join Nouns will achieve a high ROI on this initiative.\n\n\nThroughout this prop, UnitedTribes led by [@jdagogo](https://twitter.com/jdagogo) [(J.D. Heilprin)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdheilprin) will use the same approach he's used as an entrepreneur and Entrepreneur/Evangelist in Residence to generate a variety of projects, outlined below. The main focus is onboarding new communities and creating collabrative partnership opportunities for NounsDAO via WarpedWorld. \n\nWarpedWorld will kick-off with a series of IRL activations involving and proliferating the NounsDAO community.

Success will be achieved by expanding the reach of Nouns to new communities and working with the Nouns community of builders, resources, and tools to implement these proposals.\n \n\nThe success of this initiative will be measured by qualitative and quantitative metrics. To this end, J.D. and UnitedTribes will launch a blog for updates throughout the entire proposal period. J.D. will also host a live Twitter space once per month for live Q&A’s and progress updates for all things *Nouns Get Warped!*\n\n# **Proposer Background ⌐◨-◨**\n\nJ.D. is a multi-venture entrepreneur and builder who began his career at Creative Artists Agency (CAA).

J.D. and UnitedTribes will introduce Nouns to new communities and facilitate new communities joining Nouns, activating vibrant Noun sub-DAOs. J.D. will introduce Nouns and facilitate proposals across his network of media organizations, artists, and creators. \n\nUnitedTribes aims to become a fully equipped development studio and hub that creates breakthrough Nounish applications, ecosystem extensions, and synergies, starting with several core projects. Wherever possible, UnitedTribes will use existing Noun community resources, builders, and tools. \n\n# **WarpedWorld + Nouns ⌐◨-◨**\nThe Warped community includes millions of fans and thousands of participating artists, athletes, gamers, and cultural and philanthropic organizations. Warped has a long history of successful brand partnerships.\n\nJ.D. & UnitedTribes will bring the WarpedWorld project to the Nouns ecosystem.

Both projects focus on generating Nounish benefits while fostering community.\n\n**Digging Deep into J.D.’s Network & EIR experience**\n\nAs both an entrepreneur and EIR, J.D. will draw on his experience to bring additional projects and communities to the Nouns ecosystem. For example, inspired by the recent “Wizard’s Hat” short film and Wizard Nouns, J.D. has already introduced the concept of a potential Nouns collaboration with the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Warner Bros., and the Potter fan community. At Warner Bros., J.D. worked extensively with Wizarding World.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yBceGEt.png)\n\nAdditional opportunities will involve working with existing IP holders, creative, tech, and performative talent, and the institutions across J.D.’s network. \n\nJ.D. will serve as a Nouns educator, evangelist, and facilitator in both his network and the traditional media, entertainment, and marketing industries. He will introduce talent, venture capitalists, builders, developers, creatives, and prospective strategic partners to the Nouns ecosystem and opportunities for Nounish endeavors.

We have built a tool that’s tailor-made to help execute these trades: *TWAMM.* The trade will be executed completely on-chain, transparently with very low fees and minimal gas costs.\n\n## **Background**\nTWAMM is a concept introduced by [Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/07/twamm) in July 2021. *\"It works by breaking long-term orders into infinitely many infinitely small pieces and executing them against an embedded constant-product AMM smoothly over time.\"*\n\nAn on-chain AMM protocol to enable large token swap is essential to increase DeFi adoption and anti-fragility. Some interesting use cases for TWAMMs include [treasury diversification](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1502177286170185735)*,* [whale liquidations](https://twitter.com/solendprotocol/status/1538553654575214592)*,* [peg maintenance](https://www.notion.so/fd88cb37208d4b0f9abaca4e276f9ddd)*, etc*.\n\n## **Product Design & Incentives**\nWe have been researching and developing TWAMMs since November 2021 and recently launched our protocol: [announcement](https://twitter.com/cronfinance/status/1645802789006876672). The code has been audited by SpearbitDAO, open-sourced, and verified on Etherscan. There’s more detail on the protocol on our [docs page](https://docs.cronfi.com/twamm/).\n- AMM: we built our TWAMM as a custom pool on top of Balancer V2 Vaults given the *security, liquidity, flexibility, and gas advantages* of leveraging Balancer. Additionally, Balancer has become a Schelling point for protocols that want to leverage their AMM, thus creating network effects & composability advantages.\n- Traders: as a long-term trader (Nouns DAO), you only have to pay gas for starting, canceling, or withdrawing proceeds from your order. All the other sub-orders of the DCA are done virtually and cost the Nouns DAO no gas fees. Virtual orders are only written on-chain when the next user interacts with the protocol (generally an arbitrageur).\n- Arbitrageurs: as seen on other AMMs like Uniswap, arbitrageurs are important to keep the price of the assets in line with external venues. Arbitrageurs are critical for TWAMMs because trade sizes are significantly larger and last for multiple blocks. Therefore we partnered with dedicated arbitrageurs (BloXRoute) to ensure pools are frequently arbitraged thus giving you a smooth fill.\n- Liquidity: Balancer already has over ***$131M*** in wstETH and ***$62M*** in rETH in the vault. We have successfully received a [liquidity + gauge](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-265-enable-wsteth-reth-gauge-ethereum/4643) to direct some of the liquidity to our TWAMM pool to provide the resting liquidity needed to execute this trade. TWAMMs are extremely capital efficient given that the trades are split across multiple blocks and arbitrageurs consistently bring new liquidity back to the system to correct price deviations.\n\n## **Advantages**\n- Low fees: wstETH/rETH is a stable pair and long-term swappers pay a one-time **0.03% fee.**\n- Fully on-chain: zero dependencies on off-chain services, oracles, compute etc.\n- Flexible: issue, change, and cancel orders with ease.\n    - Example new order: `sell 14_000 wstETH for rETH in 100_000 blocks` ~roughly 2 weeks\n    - Easy to use Gnosis Safe custom transaction UX\n- Full control of orders and assets: non-custodial, cancellable, and withdraw proceeds at any time.\n- Withdraw multiple times: users can withdraw once at the end, or every set number of blocks – they just pay gas fees.\n- DCA over 1000’s of blocks gas-free: Nouns DAO would only pay gas for starting and ending orders, and arbitrageurs pay for placing suborders on-chain.\n- Analytics: we will have an analytics dashboard that shows how the order is being filled so the DAO can monitor the trade.\n\n## **Risks & Mitigations**\nThe first trade will be for a relatively *small* amount of roughly 400 wstETH -> rETH to ensure TWAMM executes the trade as expected. Below are a few potential risks of the system and how we have and plan to mitigate them:\n- Smart contract:\n    - Fully audited: see SpearbitDAO report [here](https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/blob/master/pdfs/CronFinance-Spearbit-Security-Review.pdf).\n    - Hack Risks: built on Balancer V2 Vaults which have been battle-tested for 2+ years.\n    - Bricked Pools: we’ve done extensive research and mitigations for gas, order DDoS, numerical underflows, incorrect TWAMM parameters etc – more info here: [0slippage](https://mirror.xyz/0slippage.eth).\n    - Loss of Funds: open-source code, audited, verified, non-custodial, users in full control of funds, trade happens over multiple blocks so it can be canceled at any time by the user.\n    - Malicious Pool Admin: all pool administrators can do is pause the pool or change fees at which point Nouns DAO can cancel and withdraw their funds.\n- Lack of Arbitrage: we have teamed up with BloXroute to provide dedicated arbitrage service. On the off chance neither service arbitrages the pool, the open market will arbitrage the pool.\n- Poor Execution: orders are cancellable at any time i.e if the price escapes preferred bounds restart the order at another time. Also, DCA is generally a better strategy than spot purchase for large orders.\n  - Monitoring: we will be actively monitoring the trade as the `delegate` to ensure the order is being filled at an optimal price. In case the trade escapes the optimal threshold, we will cancel the trade on behalf of the DAO and proceeds will be refunded to the Nouns DAO wallet.\n- Information Leakage: this is not a big concern for a stable pair like wstETH/rETH which are like assets and have deep liquidity pools.\n- MEV/Sandwich Attacks: orders are broken into small pieces and thus the benefit of front/back running orders is minimal – see the Paradigm paper for further details.\n\n## **Competition**\n\nHere are the alternatives and how they stack up against TWAMM. Note this isn’t a comprehensive list, but a short summary.\n\n- Gnosis Auction:\n    - Pros: well-tested technology\n    - Cons: reliant on well-funded keepers, minimum buy lots, price upside capped, infrastructure overhead, limited timeframe, poor execution vs DCA over long periods.\n- Manual DCA:\n    - Pros: can execute it today\n    - Cons: need to write a smart contract or fat finger mistakes, fees for each sub-order, gas costs of sub-orders, limited # of sub-orders\n- DEX/Aggregators:\n    - Pros: complete trade in a single block\n    - Cons: slippage, MEV attack vectors\n- OTC:\n    - Pros: limit orders and other novel trade execution algorithms\n    - Cons: off-chain, opaque, high fees, custodial, KYC, regulations, etc"},{"blockNumber":17129965,"blockHash":"0x8b86318113d39874d9a13a3789b9e2b0af81319ccfab65456c78cb1d4dde11f6","transactionIndex":82,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x3568b5090c4e92e17823dea65e1e8e88dfa10a46ad3f6063f040999771fe2869","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":276,"proposer":"0x4756e5a5D0668195Feb1EC0e7F96832ffc51c4A8","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000004756e5a5d0668195feb1ec0e7f96832ffc51c4a800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014f46b0400"],"startBlock":17165965,"endBlock":17201965,"description":"# Nounish Playground - The Game\n\n# Nounish Playground - The Game\n\n## TL;DR:\nWe're proposing to build a mobile platformer game with 700 levels in which we introduce players to nounish concepts and educate them on Nouns DAO and adjacent extensions while playing through fun and engaging maps. While the total budget required to complete the game development is $200,000, we are seeking funding of **$90,000** for the alpha version, which will include an **early access** release. The alpha version is expected to take 6 months to complete, followed by an additional 6 months until the final release. Once the alpha version is released, we will require the remaining budget to complete the development of the game.\n\n---\n\n## Description\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/egqCNYh.jpg)\n\n**Click on the image to view the proposed game design.**\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/j38RqEz.jpg)\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toY9TC21gyQ)\n\n\n---\n### The game is divided into two parts:\n- Single Player\n- Multiplayer\n\n### Single Player\nThe single-player mode is a platformer game.\n\nIn this mode the player controls their noun to reach its destination - to be minted and sent to auction at **Nouns DAO**.\n\nThere is a unique level for each noun minted, designed with various obstacles and challenges.\n\nWe as a nounish family are waiting every day to see what the next noun will look like and how much the winning bid is at the auction for the previous noun, but we don't know anything about each noun’s background story. We don't know what a noun has been through before it gets minted! This concept was the inspiration for this game.\n\n### Getting to know **Nounish culture**\n\nSome stages of the game are designed to indirectly teach players about the Nounish culture and the **NounsDAO** mechanism. Players will be enticed to go through these stages in order to obtain valuable rewards, and in the process, they will come across learning opportunities to grasp these concepts. We believe that direct teaching of these concepts might not be engaging for players, so we aim to make the learning experience more fun and interactive through gameplay.\n\n**Click on the picture below to see the video**👇\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/GjT0Tiw.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lclo8l3t_g)\n\n#### Gameplay\nThe player controls their noun throughout each level in a 3D playground. Nouns can run, jump, grab, climb, dive + more to overcome the obstacles until the final point is reached and the noun goes through the gate to get minted.\n\nThere is ether on the path that the player must collect to meet the goal. The goal amount of ether is set based on how much that noun sold for at auction.\n\nAfter completing each level, the player is awarded three stars. The first star is just for completing the level and the second one is awarded if the count of collected ether has reached the winning bid amount and the last star is awarded based on the time spent completing the level.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wgcyHFh.gif)\n\n\nFor example: The first level is about Noun 1 being minted and the player will have to guide the noun through the course while collecting enough ether to meet the winning bid on that noun, while trying to do it in the fastest time possible.\n\n**Click on the pictures below to watch an example of the Noun 1 & 2 levels of the game 👇**\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/b8ymd4i.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz-ouU8xErE)\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/06KwPXg.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YxpdSb2iYo)\n\n### Multiplayer\nIn this mode of the game, players enter a battle royal like Fall Guys and compete with one another.\n\nEach session starts with 40 players and three matches are held in each session. At the end of each match, only half of the players walk it through, then at the end of the third match, the final player wins the match.\n\nThe game and environment design is nounish and each level/match has its own unique theme based on nounish extensions such as lil nouns, Gnars DAO, Alps DAO, and many others where spectators are members of these communities.\n\nIn multiplayer mode, we’ll hold monthly in-game events relevant to DAO news, events, and popular holidays.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/h41ZJ6O.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UkWHRQ5.png)\nWe aim to differentiate our game from competitors by improving the user experience and providing creative ideas, attractive maps, and Nouns that engage players in exciting challenges. Ultimately, our focus is on delivering a flawless and engaging game experience, and continuously improving it to create a supportive and enjoyable experience for players.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aaNzoDt.png)\nAfter the full release of the game, we plan to hold various competitions, ranging from seasonal events to in-game events and those related to important events in the NounsDAO community. By offering special Nouns-related prizes, our goal is to create more challenges for players and familiarize them with DAOs and NFTs. Additionally, we can hold custom events upon the request of NounsDAO.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/r4In8Ph.png)\nWe aim to reach **25,000** downloads in the first month after the game's release, and strive to achieve a steady growth rate of **5%** in monthly downloads. We intend to encourage players to engage in the single-player mode and invite their friends to play the multiplayer mode.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JV5rG3L.png)\nWe incentivize players to invite their friends to play the game by offering rewards. Additionally, we create private clones for players to have a space to discuss the game.\n\n---\n\n## Why a Mobile Game?\nMobile games are easily available to everyone with a smartphone these days and have a wide audience range.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5n5Er5H.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## Nouns DAO community?\n\nGiven the importance of the Nouns DAO community to our game, we have decided to leverage the collaboration with its members by inviting them to contribute ideas, feedback, and even resources to the game. This action will help foster a sense of ownership and strengthen the connection between our game and the community, ultimately ensuring its success.\nIn addition to inviting Nouns DAO members to collaborate on the game, we have decided to launch a Discord channel to share the game's production stages with the Nouns community. This channel will serve as a communication space for receiving ideas, feedback, and criticism from Nouns community members, as well as a place to showcase the game's development stages and updates to them. By doing so, we can listen to user feedback more effectively and make the best decisions for the game in sync with the community.\n\n---\n\n## How Long Will It Take To Produce?\n\nThe early access version will be released after 6 months and then it will take 6 months more until the final release.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vV3NDUV.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6vUzwGF.png)\n\n---\n\nYou've seen and love our work with the nounish music videos we've created, let's make a game with even more impact!\n\n---\n\n## Marketing\n- App Store Optimization (ASO): This gives maximum exposure to our game in the store by lowering our cost per install (CPI) and filtering high-value users. It all needs to have localized content (Keywords, Categories, Screenshots, and Video Trailers) per region and culture. This is a full-time job of a user acquisition manager excluding producing visual content.\n- Landing page: This is a one-page website where customers can learn more about our game. The landing page includes links to the App Store and Google Play Store, promo videos, a call-to-action, screenshots, gameplay trailers and reviews.\n- Running paid Youtube and social media ads: Targeted ads on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. These platforms allow us to reach specific audiences based on factors such as demographics, interests, and behaviors.(The cost will be optimized by ASO)\n- Offering incentives for referrals: Encourage existing players to share the game with their friends by offering rewards or incentives for referrals.\n- Influencer marketing: Partnering with social media influencers or YouTubers who have a relevant audience can be an effective way to generate buzz and interest in the game. The budget could be used to compensate these influencers for promoting the game on their channels.\n----\n\n## Monetization\n- In-app purchases: Our game will offer a variety of ways for players to make in-app purchases to enhance their gaming experience and generate revenue for the game.\n  - In-Game Items: Players can purchase in-game items such as currency, power-ups, and other bonuses to improve their gameplay.\n  - Battle Passes: Players can purchase a Battle Pass to unlock new game modes, competitions, and exclusive rewards for a limited time. This popular monetization strategy creates a sense of urgency and excitement for players, increasing engagement and revenue for the game.\n  - (By offering these in-app purchases, we can provide players with new and exciting ways to engage with the game while generating revenue for the project.)\n- Sponsorship or Brand Partnerships: Collaborating with a brand to promote their product or service within the game. This can generate revenue without relying solely on in-app purchases.\n- Crowdfunding: As part of our monetization plan, we will be leveraging the power of NFTs to offer a unique crowdfunding option for our game. By purchasing an NFT from us, supporters will not only be helping to fund the development of our game, but they will also receive exclusive in-game items and benefits.\n\nThe NFTs purchased through our crowdfunding campaign will be useable within the game as character skins, attachments, and other in-game items. This provides a unique and exciting opportunity for our supporters to be part of the game's development and to have a tangible stake in its success.\n\nAdditionally, these NFTs can be traded on secondary markets, creating a potential revenue stream for our supporters and adding to the game's overall ecosystem. We believe that this innovative use of NFTs in crowdfunding will not only benefit our game's development, but also provide a new way for people to support and engage with the project.\n\n\n----\n\n\n## Who Are We?\nThe **[Genius Slackers](https://geniusslackers.com/)** team is an independent producer of video games.

This is an opportunity to create a low-cost, yet highly sought after and unique piece of hardware that fits in your pocket and carried daily with you. From conversation starters in person to unboxings and showing off on social media, this device is sleek, a standout, and an instant proliferator.\n\n[![NOUNS-PROP-GIF.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/d3NKdZM3/NOUNS-PROP-GIF.gif)](https://postimg.cc/y3R5Cd8C)\n\nMy speciality is creating exceptional and memorable digital and physical experiences through a variety of mediums (i.e. installations, hardware, web, 3D, etc.) working with notable brands such as my ongoing partnerships with Arduino; building conceptual prototypes, fashion brands such as Christopher Kane and Selfridges, and most recently, creating an [exclusive audio-reactive hardware for Zora](https://twitter.com/____zine____/status/1651233581723779078?s=20) (under [Lychee, Inc](https://lychee.vision/) - company I cofounded).\n\nWith 58k followers across my socials where 90% are avid hardware enthusiasts, there’s an exciting opportunity to introduce and build a new branch of applicability to Nouns via the Noggles LED hardware device and its CC0 files, giving them a new tool to develop firmware, create physical nounish projects and iterate further.\n\nExplorer Grants has led me here and I think there’s a lot more that Nouns and I can do together to create beautiful nounish objects, art pieces, experiences and more! Having a shared vision to build in the public domain; to open source for more creativity, collaboration and innovation – I think by embracing Nouns and my unique pov as an artist, we can produce captivating nounish creations that showcase the best of both our perspectives and amplify our collective creativity.

The desire to own a unique Noggles LED Keychain led me directly to create this proposal.\n\nNouns has the opportunity to lead the way in creating unique hardware-based artwork that many people want to own; setting new standards for innovation and creativity, that aren’t only visually stunning by highly coveted by collectors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nWith my strong social presence and commitment to open-source content, I believe I can help reinforce the Nouns brand beyond crypto. Directly through my own brand; in addition of building conceptual hardware and art installations I document videos of those builds that reach over 58,000 followers and have amassed a combined total of +10.7 million video views with a 39.9% engagement rate.\n\n**Why the Noggles LED Keychain?**\n\n- Daily-carry item, it’s an effective means of promoting Nouns and serves as an important signifier and physical representation of the Nouns identity. Its power is in its subtle daily constant that’s unavoidably carried everywhere - making it a strong means of connecting people with the Nouns community.\n- *Daily signifier → instant proliferator*\n- Affordability → low costs\n    - Estimated purchase price: ~$50 (0.025Ξ)\n\n**Hardware Specs:**\n- Array of 78 RGB LEDs\n- Customized pattern animations (firmware)\n- Button to alternate between the patterns\n- Rechargeable lithium battery via USB-C\n\n[![LED-KEYCHAIN.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/GmhydZKj/LED-KEYCHAIN.gif)](https://postimg.cc/gnQJKtfw)\n\n---\n\n# Who **For?**\nI have a high niche community of hardware enthusiasts (Instagram + TikTok) and people in Crypto (Twitter) – I think these Noggle LED Keychains will perfectly hit both demographics, especially as it will all be open-source.\n\n- **Nouners + Nouns Community**\n    - this is an artisanal nounish object, a beautifully designed novelty item\n    - a tangible semiotic Nouns device that you can carry with you daily and fits in the palm of one’s hand\n    - direct symbol and “show” of being part of the Nouns community\n- **Hardware Enthusiasts**\n    - Typical RGB LED add-ons for Arduino / Raspberry Pi can cost upwards of $50, but the Noggles LED Keychain offers an affordable alternative with a programmable ATTINY85 chip and x78 compact RGB LEDs\n    - Designed with CC0 and for hacking / tinkering, Noggles LEDs provide hardware enthusiasts the opportunity to evolve the code and proliferate Nouns by applying it to their own projects, including larger hardware projects such as IoT and the application of sensors.\n        - new applicability of Nouns → developing nounish firmware\n    - Show hardware enthusiasts and DIY electronics builders that they can build with Nouns, embody the brand’s identity and fuel their own creativity, *with Nouns*\n    - Hardware builders and creative engineers are well-positioned to explore exciting possibilities of crypto, but haven’t been shown ways of getting involved. I think with the Noggles LED Keychain (and other Nounish hardware) we can bridge this gap and show them what’s possible!\n    - ******3D Printing Enthusiasts / Product Designers (sub-group typically part of hardware builders)******\n        - CC0 enclosure files enables engineers and designers to create their own unique versions of the Noggles enclosure with a variety of materials and customizing it to their liking\n        - This opens up new opportunities for creative evolution, allowing engineers to physically make their own nounish objects and explore new design possibilities\n\nThe proposal includes the development to build, design and prototype the ***Noggles LED Keychain*** with a production run of 600 units- working with manufacturers and liaising with suppliers to meet industry standards and construct the PCB circuit from scratch, complete with a custom software and firmware that will be open-sourced, and a designed enclosure with custom packaging - all to go into production with a custom website for purchasing.\n\nTo bring the **Noggles LED Keychain** to market, the project will be divided into 6 stages over a 6 month period, with a total cost of 75Ξ to cover production, design costs, prototyping iterations, hardware components, material costs, material sourcing, labour, etc.\n\n---\n\n## **An overview of the steps to build the Noggles LED Keychain**\n\n1. **PCB Circuit Design**: This involves R&D for components, block diagrams, MCUs, preliminary design, schematic design, and PCB layout design. I'll also create multiple prototypes for testing\n    - Already in progress, currently on Prototype–V2, will need to iterate and adjust minor circuit design + components; at least 1-3 more prototypes to reach finalized design\n2. **Software / Firmware**: This includes coding the firmware to run the circuit, integrating the firmware with the hardware, and testing and debugging the product\n    - 90% complete - tweaking and evolving design patterns\n3. **Enclosure Design**: Create mockup sketches, conduct research and ideation, develop 3D models and CAD designs, and source materials and manufacturers for the enclosure. We'll also create and test three prototypes\n    - Resin based material → variety of colours\n    - Engraved text → will discuss with Nouners to ensure it accurately reflects the DAO and your values\n        [![Nouns-Case.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/Ls8wk6TZ/Nouns-Case.gif)](https://postimg.cc/yD2LsK2V)\n        \n    - Need to prototype, finish CAD design, create moulds and experiment with resin material and colours\n        - Will be handmade by me <3\n4. **Manufacturers**: Liaise with suppliers and vendors to source the necessary components\n5. **Packaging**: Design, prototype, and source packaging materials for the product.\n    - *Very* Early-Stage Packaging Concepts / Mockups (design will evolve with further development and ideation) → thinking about unconventional packaging and a unique experience that accurately reflects Nouns\n        - Nouns Tin Can Packaging\n            - I want to challenge traditional packaging designs, especially to fit Nouns → make the packaging compelling in of itself and unexpected but embodying the playful and nuanced identity of Nouns\n                \n               [![Nouns-Packaging-two.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/6pYCZ9qS/Nouns-Packaging-two.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/nX9sbfvY)\n                \n6. **Website** – an Overview of Purchase Strategy (Crypto and Non-Crypto natives)\n    - Access open-source files, code, schematics + guides to “hack / tinker” with the Nouns LED Keychain to create custom pattern colours → CC0\n    - To purchase a Nounish Hardware\n        - **Pay with Crypto** → crypto consumers → also obtain NFT\n        - **Pay with Card** → non-crypto natives → proliferating meme / Noun\n            - mainly thinking about my main audience on TikTok / Reels are not crypto-based but hardware enthusiasts and creative technologists / engineers\n    \n    - **Mockup Designs**(initial ideas → 3 different concepts; to be developed further):\n        \n        [![tigris-noggles-website.png](https://i.postimg.cc/DzpQ92Ks/tigris-noggles-website.png)](https://postimg.cc/7C7T7rhY)\n \n---\n\n## Allocate Supply to the DAO (50 units) + Profit to the DAO (100%)\nI’m very grateful for the opportunity and support the past few months as I’ve been exploring Nouns, as a thank you I’d like to **supply 50 units of the Noggles LED Keychain** as NFTs which can be redeemable at a later time.\n\nI’m most keen and excited about getting this hardware to as many hands as possible and proliferate Nouns in a new tangible format, which I wouldn’t be able to do at such a scale without the support of Nouns. \n\nSo simply being paid for my time to build, experiment and co-create with Nouns is massively rewarding!

More details on matching [here](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&grant=&grant=&grant=&match=1000).)\n\n## Why \n- Because it is a good thing to do: It is a crucial time for crypto, from a regulatory perspective. The work being done by the organizations in this Gitcoin round is important and we all benefit from it. We also help by signaling our support and raising awareness of the effort. \n- Because it is Nounish: we see generosity and funding things that benefit the crypto community, at large, as core Nounish values. \n- Because it is good for Nouns DAO: giving money to support crypto helps us build good will in the crypto community and attract community members who want to buy a Noun, or join the community generally, because they want to be a part of supporting similar work. There is also significant attention on this mint right now, and the mint amount \"leaderboard,\" and we see this as a unique timely marketing opportunity. \n\nThanks for your time :) "},{"blockNumber":17141400,"blockHash":"0x17b6f5eaab33f97037e538ba563e94cef8e7c07ec93d54f03865dcd75c2e333c","transactionIndex":131,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xdacc994e722ffb389194fe2c104f39487bf3f80039c9e67018c02124d7bd4fad","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":279,"proposer":"0x0B3CF56E7dF3BB3Fb7201fFcD96d279b05DDd2E3","targets":["0x55A4E5123F8923500fF7AA97e75231a54A9c233a"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":17177400,"endBlock":17213400,"description":"# ethOS: A crypto-native, mobile OS\n\n### **TLDR:**\nApple and Google are holding back Web3 mobile development.\n\nethOS is a free and **open source** mobile OS that embraces Ethereum and makes Web3 delightful on mobile.\n\nWe've been building ethOS as a public good for more than a year (currently at ethOS v2.1) without any funding.\n\nCurrently, using ethOS requires flashing an older Pixel.\n\nWe’d love NounsDAO's support in the launch of a turn-key, consumer friendly ethOS device.\n\n### **Who are we?**\n\nethOS is a group of nine developers and designers passionate about Ethereum and Web3 who have been building it since winter of 2021.\n\n[@mk](https://warpcast.com/mk) (markkat.eth, Noun 191) wrote the [ΞPhone Manifesto](https://discord.com/channels/910934588073840700/916441442514272327) in 12/22 which kick-started ethOS. He remains an ethOS co-founder. [@markus](https://warpcast.com/markus) (mhaas.eth, https://nf.td/markus)  is also a co-founder and leads development for ethOS. Team ethOS consists of multiple founders, YC Alum, and members with significant Web3 industry experience.\n\nOur website: [ethosmobile.org](https://ethosmobile.org)\n\n![EthOS Render](https://i.ibb.co/wsP4cTC/Clean-Shot-2023-04-27-at-20-51-41-2x.png)\n\n### **Why are we building ethOS?**\n\nEthereum on mobile is nerfed by gatekeepers. Most consumer internet activity occurs on mobile devices. However, Android and iOS treat Ethereum as just another application, rather than the protocol that underpins Web3. For example, the iOS OpenSea app doesn’t let you buy, sell, or even _send_ NFTs, because [Apple wants a cut of Ethereum gas fees.](https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/12/01/coinbase-apple-30-percent-fee-digital-wallet/) Uniswap has created an iOS wallet that Apple didn’t approve for months, and [they don’t know why](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1631691337845075968). Furthermore, the Web3 user experience is terrible. Using Ethereum dapps on mobile means browsing within a wallet, and bouncing back and forth between the wallet and the web app. This also prevents new interaction models (such as pay-as-you-stream streaming for audio NFTs). [Apple also does not allow token-gated features](https://decrypt.co/112804/apple-clarifies-app-store-rules-barring-nft-utility-external-purchase-links). Android and iOS are permissioned platforms by design, and this hinders Web3 development. By offering a meaningful alternative, we can push these companies to adopt Ethereum, or lose market share.\n\nethOS fully embraces Ethereum to unlock the full potential of Web3. ethOS features an onboard Ethereum light node and a System level wallet, allowing for direct interaction between mobile applications and Ethereum, and giving users more security and control over their assets. Unlike iOS and Android, ethOS doesn’t own the App Store. In the spirit of Web3, ethOS supports competition and composability among apps services.\n\n### **Where are we at?**\n\nWe launched ethOS v2.0 at ETH Denver 2023, and released ethOS v2.1 last month. We have been building continuously since December 2021. Despite not taking any funding, we maintain a rapid pace of development, and have a long list of exciting functionality and features to bring to ethOS. Some of the cool features of ethOS available today include:\n\n**Onboard light node**\n- No need for centralized RPC services pre-merge. Post-merge it gets data from a centralized RPC, but verifies the data using beaconchain data.\n- Less man-in-the-middle risk\n- Further decentralizes access to Ethereum in the future using the Portal Network\n\n**System-level wallet** \n - Approves transactions without leaving the browser or app\n - Removes the need for the centralized WalletConnect service\n\n**NFT minting from Gallery/Camera**\n - Create an NFT in seconds\n\n**XMTP messaging**\n - Decentralized messaging between Ethereum or ENS addresses\n\n**ENS integration**\n - Contacts leverage ENS\n\n**Private Key Management via Secure Enclave**\n - Private key is encrypted using symmetric key stored on SPU\n\n**Biometric signing of transactions**\n - Sign a transaction in-app or in-browser with your fingerprint, without having to switch over to the wallet\n\n**Android apps and Services**\n - Install all apps available in the Google Play Store and get traditional Google Play Services for your Android apps\n\n**Three Browser**\n - A full web browser integrated with the system wallet for seamless signing\n\nHere’s swapping on Uniswap on ethOS:\n[https://youtu.be/3PiMTGq3i-A](https://youtu.be/3PiMTGq3i-A)\n\nHere’s minting an NFT on ethOS:\n[https://youtu.be/edVpdWwq-6A](https://youtu.be/edVpdWwq-6A)\n\n### **The Purpose of this Proposal**\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to ask for a grant that allows us to launch ethOS devices for anyone to purchase.\n\nCurrently, users have to jump through a lot of hoops to try out ethOS. We and our community have been building and testing ethOS on out-of-date devices (Pixel3, 3XL, and 5a). This has enabled us and our community to get devices at a low cost, but it is not a model for widespread adoption. To use ethOS today, users must find and buy used devices, and they must be OEM unlocked (many are incorrectly labeled). This is a major impediment to adoption.\n\nethOS is now ready for the Web3 community at large, and we are going to make it available pre-installed on current Pixel 7s. To make this happen, we must update ethOS to be compatible with Pixel 7s (a development lift), and establish a delightful sales and quality distribution process (orders on website, sourcing of devices, installation of ethOS, branding/boxing, and fulfillment). Most costs associated with achieving this are for sourcing devices, packing materials, shipping, laser-etching, and developer time.\n\nOur team has worked unpaid thus far; however, three of our developers will be transitioning to a paid status as we begin to sell and support a consumer-grade device. With full time engineers, we can build even faster, and better support the growing ethOS developer community.\n\nThis is an important time in the evolution of ethOS, and funding would greatly assist us in this transition.\n\n### **What’s in it for Nouns?**\n\nWe believe that building an open source, mobile operating system as a public good is a very Nounish goal. Everyone in the Ethereum ecosystem is aware of the negative effect that Apple and Google gate-keeping has on Web3 mobile. ethOS represents a critical effort to unlock the potential of Ethereum on mobile, and to increase Ethereum adoption.\n\nOur first ethOS device will also have a Nounish option! To thank Nouns for their support, purchasers of the ethOS phone can choose the Nounish Edition, which feature generative Nounish wallpaper, a Noggle-sporting ethOS logo etched on the back of their device, and Nounish packaging to deliver a delightful experience for the user. It will look something like this:\n\n![Nouns Edition](https://i.ibb.co/K5nNQKc/Clean-Shot-2023-04-27-at-21-08-46-2x.png)\n\nWe will also prominently thank Nouns for their support on our website and in our social channels for providing the necessary public goods funding for the first ethOS phone.\n\n### **Why we are submitting a Proposal**\n\nWe believe that ethOS can be supported in a Web3 native manner that is consistent with the goals of a free and open-source operating system that embraces Ethereum. We have not taken any venture funding to date for this reason. A grant from Nouns would greatly help us advance our mission at this critical time. Furthermore, support from Nouns would raise awareness for ethOS.\n\n### **The Ask and Deliverable**\nWe are asking for 40 eth (~ $76k) in funding delivered at 0x55A4E5123F8923500fF7AA97e75231a54A9c233a.\n\nWe will make the ethOS phone available for purchase in Summer 2023.\n\nThank you kindly for your consideration,\nTeam ethOS\n"},{"blockNumber":17143647,"blockHash":"0x77c18b77493bdd3d6978bef5fa072dba10482e899da9b2cc681beffcbf3fb7ac","transactionIndex":107,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xb1dfd649bc444a4583a2efa70b319606756340812efbb4df0b07644ae89186d7","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":280,"proposer":"0xAEC4075e4fc8cE829BC4f0cFD5e2fA10dd2b12D1","targets":["0xc662a8Ce36392d4B9489D0B59605a1874711BFc6"],"signatures":["changeName(address,uint256,string,uint8,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000009c8ff314c9bc7f6e59a9d9225fb22946427edc0300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002af00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000054a656c6c4f000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"],"startBlock":17179647,"endBlock":17215647,"description":"# Name (recently acquired) Noun 687 on NFTR\n\n## TLDR\n\nNFTR is the NFT identity registry on Ethereum.

Elegance, versatility, and performance are the three things that make a good single-board computer. Noun-Computers will be much more versatile and convenient than raspberry pi and arduino boards Noun-Computers will enable people to work on much bigger and more ambitious projects thanks to an innovative Noun-breadbook (a reinvented breadboard). The Breadbook is a new type of device that would replace outdated breadboards and allow developers to arrange software and hardware setups more cleanly and understandably. I propose to apply for a few patents and trademarks and later give everyone open access to the inventions if needed.\n\nThe Noun-Devices will be available in the $40-$60 price range and distributed strictly using a fixed price policy to ensure that the end users do not overpay. The money from sales will be used to further proliferate NounsDAO by introducing more devices, modules, books, and tutorials. All future products will be branded and aligned with the nounish culture.\n\nNounsDAO can **sponsor ETH Hackathons** by providing the first 400 Noun-Computer kits. Also, 30% of the supply will be allocated to **Nouns-Computer Fund** any nouner will be able to request computers for **Public Good** via an on-chain proposal and send it to developing countries, minority groups, or other purposes.\n\nWe can bring NounsDAO to **Consumer Electronic Show (CES**) where we will have an opportunity to talk with big companies and media outlets about how NounsDAO builds an internet government, growth a global community of talented people, enables multidisciplinary collaborations, and funds cool projects with a meaningful impact on the future such as Noun-Computers. We can show the world innovative devices that will be used at universities, schools, and indie projects around the world.\n\n## The problem\n![](https://i.imgur.com/g7sIhYL.png)\n\nHow can we reach new communities and establish a sustainable proliferation model for NounsDAO? My idea is to grow a community of software and hardware developers around new, affordable, and innovative Noun-Computers. Noun-Computers will win the hearts and minds of developers by improving the software and hardware prototyping experience.\n- **[Price and Availability]** Schools and universities do not use a single-board computer in their curriculum due to price inconsistency. For example, raspberry pi 4 boards are advertised to cost $70 but you are never able to buy them at that price. The market price for raspberry pi 4 is over $160. By manufacturing Noun-Computers, we can prevent any price speculations and make truly affordable and widely available single-board computers.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Oqo5Ojb.png)\n\n- **[Versatility & Capability]** \nThe Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook would be very intuitive and easy to use. A well-selected combination of features, interfaces and elements placement on the board would allow to free the working space for other elements/modules. The Noun-Computers performance will be enough to run ETH staking node, run deep learning and computer vision applications. The Noun-Computer will be a size of a credit card that can work as a stand-alone device or with a Noun-Breadbook. We are going to fit the following features:\n    - AM62Ax Sitara, Arm Cortex-A53 1.4 GHz\n    - M.2 ports x2 for SSD, GPS modules expansion\n    - MicroSD x1\n    - Bluetooth & WiFi\n    - Ethernet\n    - 40-pin GPIO Header\n    - USB-C x3 for power, tethered connection, peripherals, monitor, etc\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R0Ol8Uo.png)\n- **[Aesthetic]** Existing single-board computers use ports and dongles (HDMI, ethernet, USB) that raise the cost, limit portability, and result in bad aesthetics. Custom simple boards (microcontroller based) give you better aesthetics but limited functionality. Likewise, Custom Systems (CPU based) would have good aesthetics and capability but are too expensive to design for individuals. Noun-Computers would allow greater flexibility in developing tidy electronic prototypes with custom expansion boards that feature USB-C ports, plug-in card connectors, and digital pins. Below is an image of breadboard-based setups. One of the core problems is that the breadboard-based prototyping setups are not portable, clumsy, and difficult to keep in one piece hence you can't work on your great ideas from a coffee shop or take your work to a class. Likewise, it is hard to use breadboard-based projects to explain your software and hardware ideas in a concise, precise, and understandable manner. The breadboard was invented back in the 1880s and there was no innovation in the breadboard design in the past 143 years! ([\"Electrical Switch board\"](https://patents.google.com/patent/US231708A)).\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4PX7sxT.png)\n\n## Noun-Computer\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wMkKAC9.png)\nNoun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook are new devices that provide a foundation for inexpensive software and hardware prototyping. Noun-Devices will enable any developer to build clean, portable, and good-looking hardware prototypes that work. We will be able to reach and educate millions of developers around the globe and build nounish dev communities. With Noun-Computers, NounsDAO will win the hearts and minds of developers. All the devices will be designed to be best in performance, price, and user experience categories.\n\nThe Noun-Computer will compete in performance and price with raspberry pi and arduino boards. The devices will be sold via a fixed price policy to ensure that end users do not overpay.\nThe Noun-Devices will cost $40-$60. Similar devices on the market are advertised as cheap but usually sold for $100~$160. The money from sales will be used to introduce more nounish devices, books, tutorials, and sponsor eth hackathons.\n\nAll documentation, tutorials, and books will use nouns assets as well as electrical components on the computer boards will be arranged in the form of noggles.\n\n## Noun-Breadbook\nNoun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook are new devices that work together and provide a fundamentally new way to work on software and hardware projects. Noun-Breadbook is a reinvented breadboard and my original idea and I would love to work with NounsDAO to bring this game-changing device to life. The key to success is to make Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook complement each other and work together as one modular system. I believe that Noun-Devices will be widely accepted at universities, schools, startups, and indie dev. It is an expensive project but has a great return on investment and will be a sustainable way to proliferate NounsDAO. We can put Nouns to [Consumer Electronic Show](https://www.ces.tech/) in Las Vegas and generate a lot of positive exposure to NounDAO through press and tv.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MMmpIQq.png)\nThe Noun-Breadbook will replace old breadboards allowing easy connection of modules to a Noun-Computer. The pages will be available in different configurations that would increase the versatility of the whole system. The breadbook binder will be made from aluminum. The main function of the binder is to connect pages, supply power, and connect the board to ports such as HDMI, USB-C, and AUDIO.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/USOoae5.png)\nThe pages of the Noun-Breadbook would be assembled from layers of paper, encapsulation, cathode, and anode. The pages are going to provide a base for soldering components. The pages will be flexible and made using technology used in the production of flexible displays. The Noun-Breadbook will be lightweight and flexible to enable compact design and portability.\n\nI have been working in academia for a long time and know that new devices such as Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook would significantly improve user experience and inspire people to work on bigger and more ambitious projects.\n\n## Using Noun-Breadbook as an interactive textbook\nAn interactive book based on Noun-Breadbook will be the most nounish book in academia, period! The design of Noun-Computer and Breadbook would allow people to work on creative projects. For example, users will be able to use blank pages to document their work and development progress. Likewise, users will be able to share their work by sharing printable breadbooks. Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook would be appreciated by universities and schools around the globe. It is also possible that in the future the Breadbook would be adopted as a learning platform by Computer Science and Engineering schools.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fr00zAZ.jpg)\nHere are the photos of how the Noun-Computer and Noun-breadbook would enhance user experience.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Nhe3Hz3.jpg)\nThe pages can be used to give instructions to a user.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lFKpnUB.jpg)\nI will write a book with five complete tutorials that will teach how to develop applications for cameras, graphics, networks, I/O interfaces, and servo controllers. For example, a Camera Lab would like something like this where you can learn everything you need to know to develop applications from scratch. In this Lab, you will learn about the implementation and design patterns of camera applications. For example: take photos and videos; object/face tracking; mapping environment\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0yUM0xL.jpg)\nThis Lab will teach you everything you need to know to program computer graphics from scratch. In this Lab, you will learn about the implementation and design patterns of beautiful UI and animations.\n\n## Deliverables\n- Sponsor ETH Hackathons, and provide 400 Noun-Computer kits for competitions\n- Donate 30% of supply to developing countries and minority groups\n- Photo & Video report every month on the state of the progress\n- Invention patents (to be released for open access)\n- Booths at Consumer Electronic Show & Mobile World Congress\n- Guest Lectures at 20 Universities around the globe\n- A Noun-Computer will be available in the $40-$60 price range\n- A Blank Noun-Breadbook will be available in the $50-$70 price range\n- An Interactive Noun-Breadbook will be available in the $90 - $130 price range\n\nThe money from sales of the devices will be used to support future development and manufacturing.\n\n## Outsourcing companies\nI have many years of experience working with two great companies KS Technology and Hansaem digitec.\n- KS Technology https://altium.kr/\n- Hansaem digitec https://www.hsdgt.com/main/main.html\n\n## Timeline\n**Phase I&II - Prototypes v0.1~1 (4 months)**\nNowadays, the development and manufacturing of a single-board computer might be trivial given the available knowledge. However, the challenge is to design a perfect combination of single board computer and breadbook layout that would give people the freedom to build creative circuits and prototypes.\n- [May~Aug 2023] Manufacture and test first 100 Noun-Computer prototypes\n- [Sep 2023] Sponsor ETH global hackathon NY by providing Noun-Computers for hardware competitions\n\n**Phase III - Mass Manufacturing (5 months)**\nMass manufacturing of Noun-Computer devices would require the development of manufacturing methods, safety approvals, quality control tests, etc. Manufacturing is a difficult process and it would be best to outsource it to a third-party company. There are a lot of companies that manufacture PCBs and electronic devices in Korea. We just need to invest time and money into developing requirements, manufacturing methods, and quality control.\n- [Sep~Oct 2023] Prototype v2\n- [Nov 2023] Mass production\n- [Jan 2024] Showcase Noun-Computers and Noun-Breadbook at CES and MWC, two of the most prestigious consumer electronics shows\n\n**Phase IV - Proliferation**\nThe proliferation phase is the time when the NounsDAO will be able to harvest fruits from its investment. We will bring NounsDAO to CES, where we alongside with most innovative companies. I will personally visit 10+ universities and give guest lectures and master classes on Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook. I will write an Interactive book based on Noun-Breadbook that will be used for ages to come.\n- Raise additional capital from investors (Shark tank) and put Noun-Computers in schools, universities, and malls around the US.\n\n## About me\nTwitter: [fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)\nDuring my years in grad school, I worked on multiple projects that were published in science journals [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9061015/) [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33187144/) [[3]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08037-y).\nNoun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook are my original idea and I would love to work with NounsDAO to bring these game-changing devices to life. I believe that Noun-Computer and Breadbook would be widely accepted in universities, schools, and startups. I will personally visit 10+ universities and give lectures and master classes on Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook. It is an expensive project and I do not think it would be possible without support from an open-minded community such as NounsDAO.\nHere is a photo of my previous single-board computer that I developed during my ph.d. years.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IcMiqKe.jpg)\n\n\n## Budget\nIt is hard to give an exact size of the budget for such a project. However, in my experience, designing embedded systems, necessary software, manufacturing cost, and safety approvals and patents would be around $1.1 million. All excess money will be sent back to the NounsDAO treasury on March 1, 2024.\n\n**Phase I - Prototyping Noun-Computer (4 months)**\n**$150,000** - Noun-Computer prototype, stand with ports, and firmware development\n - Select components (Processor, DRAM, Interfaces etc)\n - Circuit design\n - PCB artwork with 6~8 layers (noggles themed)\n - Prototype manufacturing and testing\n\n**$50,000** - 1/2 fiveoceans_dev's compensation (I will use this funds to work full time on Nouns-Computers and offset prototyping expenses.\n**Subtotal: $200,000**\n\n**Phase II - Prototyping Noun-Breadbook (3 months)**\n**$170,000** - Noun-Breadbook prototype development and manufacturing methods\n - Binder and flexible pages concept design\n - Breadbook-pages prototype manufacturing using methods used in flexible electronics\n - Binder2pages interface prototyping\n - Pages2modules interface prototyping\n\n**$50,000** - 2/2 fiveoceans_dev's compensation (I will use this funds to offset expenses and write an interactive book based on Noun-Breadbook for electrical engineering and computer science majors).

Why not execute the project in several smaller phases?\nI spend a long time debating myself what is the best option to ask NounsDAO to fund the Noun-Computers project. Some members prefer to fund a proof of concept and request builders to submit proposals for recurrent funding. This option helps to protect the treasury from bad actors who do not keep their promises. To give the members confidence, we request that 82% of the funds be sent to a multi-sig safe with 4/7 well-known signers. Requesting a full amount at once would make it clear how much funds the DAO needs to commit to accomplish the full project. It also would allow me to focus only on execution.\n\n#### 2. What's in it for NounsDAO?\nThe NounsDAO would benefit by building a community of developers, onboarding student programmers, helping communities in need, and diversifying/decentralizing the Ethereum network. The first group of users is devs at ETH Global hackathons. I believe many enthusiasts would like to run an Ethereum staking node or develop applications. The second group of users is university students. There is a real opportunity to do a public good by teaching students programming, finding new blockchain builders, invite people to NounsDAO. The third group of users are people who can not afford a laptop. NounsDAO will be able to donate 30% of the supply of Noun-Computers to developing countries and minority groups. The fourth group is blockchain enthusiasts. There are not many affordable single-board computers that are specifically developed to run an Ethereum node. Currently, plug-and-play nodes cost $1,600~$3,500. Or alternative based on a raspberry pi 4 with all the dongles would cost around $360.\n\n#### 3. Why not allocate 100% of the supply to NounsDAO?\nIt is a very expensive project, and I believe it should have a long-term vision to guarantee a return on investment for NounsDAO. I am always very careful with the promises I make. In this proposal, I promise to allocate 30% or around 900~1,500 units of the supply to the Noun-Computers fund. Any nouner will be able to request the computer by submitting a proposal similar to Nouns Vision noggles. The rest of the supply will be sold and around $650,000 will be used to manufacture the next batch of Noun-Computers and develop new devices, modules, and tutorials. I think with that capital we will be able to continue growing the community around Noun-computers.\n\n#### 4. Why not just buy and give away raspberry pi computers?\nIt is a great option however, it is extremely difficult to buy a large batch of raspberry pi computers due to unavailability. Also, the prices are often determined by resellers. It is also much more meaningful to onboard new developers with nounish devices. Another big part of the proposal is to bring NounsDAO to ETH global hackathons and CES with new devices such as Noun-Breadbook.\n\n#### 5. Who are the end users of Noun-Computers?\nThe target users are devs at ETH Global hackathons,  blockchain supporters, university students, minority groups, and people in developing countries.\n\n#### 6. What would differentiate this from any other box of components and controller or other guides on the Internet? What are we multiplying here or what is this teaching differently?\nBy developing Noun-Computer and Breadbook we will be able to set a new standard for software and hardware prototyping. First, these devices will be affordable and available at a fixed price. Second, the form factor of the devices would allow users to freely bring their setups with them. Third, users will be able to develop good-looking setups that others can easily understand and follow. It is going to be a much more satisfying educational platform to learn coding and hacking. We can provide a solution to millions of people while continuously proliferating NounsDAO.\n\n#### 7. What SBC design will the board be based on? What SOM/ application processor would you use and have you done much of that design work before?\nThe main differences are MPUs have a ball grid array that has a high pin count and requires a more complex PCB Routing. Also, MPUs operate at GHz frequencies that require all signal routes to be of the same length/topology. Last, PCB boards for MPUs have more complex ICs and would require at least 6-8 layers. I previously designed boards with MCUs and working on an MPU board is new to me. For me working on projects with Nouns is also a learning opportunity.  I think constantly learning, new opportunities, and working with the community are what make NounsDAo so fun. Of course, I would use the help of my peers from academia to fine-tune the designs. I would like to design a Noun-Computer around AM62Ax Sitara MPU with Arm Cortex-A53 1.4 GHz. The SBC will feature the following ports and interfaces.\n- AM62Ax Sitara, Arm Cortex-A53 1.4 GHz\n- M.2 ports x2 for SSD, GPS modules, etc\n- MicroSD x1\n- Bluetooth & WiFi\n- Ethernet\n- 40-pin GPIO Header\n- USB-C x3 for power, tethered connection, peripherals, monitor, etc\n\n#### 9. Did you consider receiving compensation in Nouns instead?\nI would love someday to call myself a nouner! I would definitely try to save some of the money from compensation to acquire a noun (I requested two payments of $50,000 each as my compensation for this project). If this project will be approved I would need to work full time and dedicate myself to making a great Noun-Computer. Monetary compensation would give me the needed freedom to focus and succeed. I also think this project has a good chance to be profitable because the number of potential customers is huge. So it will be possible not only to guarantee the continuous proliferation of NounsDAO but also to return some of the money to the treasury by acquiring Nouns."},{"blockNumber":17163196,"blockHash":"0x055733c16f4f36fcea8767808e58214c050810b548ba0eb0c79e9e24ee55697b","transactionIndex":109,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x654688b5cab592c7bd00374737053102f13e84dccfd896598ca21ec33c07a7cd","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":282,"proposer":"0xb9e43E4fA60C0a702A417d5E7e6Df37151C1dA28","targets":["0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d"],"signatures":["_setDynamicQuorumParams(uint16,uint16,uint32)"],"calldatas":["0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003e800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005dc00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f4240"],"startBlock":17199196,"endBlock":17235196,"description":"# Dynamic Quorum Updates\n\n**Author: [Nounlius](https://twitter.com/nounlius)**\n**TL;DR - reduce max quorum from 20% to 15%**\n\n**Dynamic Quorum Parameter Updates**\nAs articulated in this [detailed post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE), three parameters need to be set for dynamic quorum.\n\n**CURRENT SETTINGS**\nMinimum quorum %: currently set to 10%\nMaximum quorum %: currently set to 20%\nCoefficient: currently set to 1, such that each against vote raises the quorum requirement by one vote, until the maximum quorum is reached.\n\n**PROPOSED SETTINGS**\nMinimum quorum %: 10% (no change)\nMaximum quorum %: set to 15%\nCoefficient: 1 (no change)\n\n**RATIONALE**\n\n[Prop 261](https://nouns.wtf/vote/261) recently adjusted Dynamic Quorum to ensure only \"Hell Yes\" proposals are executed. The stated rationale was the following\n\n> 1. Dynamic quorum was designed so that contentious proposals would require a higher degree of support.\n> 2. Maximum quorum is currently too low to have changed the outcome of any recent proposals.\n> 3. Increasing maximum quorum should increase the percentage of successful proposals that are \"hell yes\" initiatives.\n\nWhat appears to be conveniently left out is the \"Why\" behind [Dynamic Quorum](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE): which was to protect the DAO from voter apathy as an attack vector in an effort to move the DAO one step closer to removing the veto.\n\nThe recent change is a misuse of this DAO parameter to serve a particular point of view. As Wilson Cusack [pointed out](https://twitter.com/WilsonCusack/status/1644338325908606976/photo/1), functionally speaking Dynamic Quorum serves to privilege against votes. \n\nGenerally speaking, contentious proposals lead to higher voter turnout. There may be a case to be made that setting Dynamic Quorum to 0 would incentivize higher voter participation and/or delegation—which would increase DAO health. The inverse may also be true, the higher the dynamic quorum the less incentive there is to participate on the margins given the increases barrier to successful proposals—which reduces DAO health.\n\nThis proposal will revert to *Maximum Quorum's* original setting of 15%, meanwhile encouraging further discussion on whether or not to remove the Dynamic Quorum altogether.\n\n**PROPOSAL TRANSACTIONS**\n_setDynamicQuorumParams: sets dynamic quorum params to:\n\nMinimum quorum BPs: 10% (1000 basis points) (no change).\nMaximum quorum BPs: 15% (1500 basis points).\nCoefficient: 1 (1,000,000 in unsigned integer with 6 decimal places) (no change)."},{"blockNumber":17173672,"blockHash":"0xc3ec6cbbcd700777b390be89efe42825035933324cda5d65cb10334943381e12","transactionIndex":160,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x865e5ee6a731d69c397ac150e9765265e1f8ecb4f82ccab5b69e8bd6926a23c8","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":283,"proposer":"0x1db19B9903c5510AA5a866ea643Eb021CD12Bda0","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000005af650fb11d0cdba97fa806ca860e5c403726bf900000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011a6083600"],"startBlock":17209672,"endBlock":17245672,"description":"# Clothing, Every Day, Forever\n\n## **TL;DR** \n- Allocate **75,800 USDC** for the development of **wears.wtf⌐◨-◨**, a  clothing brand that transforms Nouns' incredible CC0 assets into distinctive, ready-to-wear clothing.\n- By **collaborating with [LEBLANCSTUDIOS](https://www.instagram.com/leblancstudios/?hl=en), a fashion brand with 10+ years in experience**, we seek to bring wears.wtf⌐◨-◨ to market very smoothly. \n    - Initial collection marketing will be directed towards the Nounish Ecosystem, Twitter, and LEBLANCSTUDIOS' customer base (3500+ customers). \n- This process will be divided in 2 phases: [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] and [PRODUCTION EXPANSION].\n    - **[PROOF-OF-DEMAND]** is this **current** proposal.\n        - Includes a 100-200 piece test limited-edition drop to measure demand and other metrics. \n        - After the test drop, we'll be launching a 400 piece drop focused on the nounssentials line (explained later on the prop). \n    - **[PRODUCTION EXPANSION]** would be a **future** proposal. \n    - After both phases are done, wears.wtf⌐◨-◨ will effectively become completely self-sustainable,and will keep iterating, experimenting, and ultimately growing as a business & platform. \n- wears.wtf⌐◨-◨ opens up endless possibilities, such as creating limited edition clothing for an specific cause, designing apparel inspired by Nouns community events, and incorporating fashion into proposals across various domains.\n\n## **THE WEARS.WTF TEAM** \n\n[LEBLANCSTUDIOS](https://www.instagram.com/leblancstudios/?hl=en). A Dominican clothing brand founded in 2014. With an awareness of globalization, highlighting personal identity, LEBLANCSTUDIOS strives to become a social and cultural  movement that empowers an emerging generation of people across all continents to express themselves.  **LEBLANCSTUDIOS is available among retailers like [ODIN NYC](https://odinnewyork.com/) (USA) and [THE FORUMIST](https://store.theforumist.com/) (EUROPE)**.\n- **LEBLANCSTUDIOS will provide the following talent to the wears.wtf team**: \n    - 2 Senior Creative Directors & Co-Founders of LEBLANCSTUDIOS:\n        -  Angelo Beato & Yamil Arbaje\n    - Fashion Marketer, Pattern Maker, Material Sourcing Specialist, Production Manager, Sales/E-COMM Manager, Graphic Designer, Copywriter, Editor\n\n- **LEBLANCSTUDIOS is also providing already established partnerships with manufacturers in the following countries**: Turkey, Peru, India, Italy, Portugal, China, USA\n\n\n[necfas](https://twitter.com/necfas). I (necfas) have always desired to wear clothing that embodies the essence of Nouns in one way or another. Rather than purchasing generic t-shirts and having them embroidered or printed myself, I wanted apparel that genuinely reflects the unique significance that Nouns hold for me. As the nounish creative lead, my role is to ensure that the designs we create are in sync with the Nouns culture. I will be responsible for providing creative suggestions and guidance, aiming to produce intriguing and exceptional designs that best represent the essence of Nouns. This is a genuine, wholehearted attempt to offer something that could potentially bring significant value to the DAO. \n\n\n\n## **2 PHASES**\n### [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] & [PRODUCTION EXPANSION]\n\n- This phase aims to gauge the community's interest in the clothing line by producing a limited-edition, low-supply (100-200) collection. After the test drop, we'll be launching a 400 piece drop focused on the nounssentials line. Phase 1's marketing will be focused towards the Nouns community, twitter, and LEBLANCSTUDIOS' customer base. We will use promotional videos and clothing shoots to gather attention for the launch. \n\n    -  **Phase 1 will clearly define the following metrics**:\n        - Cost of Goods Sold \n        - Gross Margin\n        - Operating Expenses\n        - Net Profit Margin\n        - Sell-through Rate\n        - Conversion Rate\n        - Average Order Value (AOV)\n        - Return on Investment (ROI) - limited to the scale of the first collection\n    \n*The wears.wtf team will produce reports of these metrics on a regular basis in order to be as transparent as possible.* \n\n- Once PROOF-OF-DEMAND is completed, we'll move on to the next phase PRODUCTION EXPANSION, a future proposal. We'll start producing the other clothing lines, like NOUNSWEAR and NOUNSJACKETS (explained later in the prop). \n    - After the Production Expansion phase, the project will be able to support itself, and we'll always include special Nounish details in our branding to maintain the origin. We'll also make sure nounssentials are available to purchase online everyday, forever. Phase 2 will include a thourough marketing campaign that will focus on expanding to a broader audience, including non-crypto-natives by leveraging all of the metrics acquired during phase 1. \n\n    -  **Phase 2 will clearly define the following metrics**:\n        - Inventory Turnover\n        - Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) \n        - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)\n        - Conversion Rate\n        - Customer Retention Rate\n        - Return on Investment (ROI) - overall various collections\n\n\n\n## **HOW**\n\n **Collaboration and Design Process**: \n- The LEBLANCSTUDIOS' team and I (necfas) have worked to create unique designs that resonate with the Nouns community. The design process will involve brainstorming, sketching, and refining concepts that embody the essence of the community and its values.\n-  This collaboration ensures that the final designs are a perfect blend of art, fashion, and what's considered nounish.\n\n**Design Selection and Production**: \n- After gathering feedback and iterating on the designs, the team will finalize 8 different designs for the nounssentials drop, once the [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] limited edition TEST drop is complete.\n- the [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] limited edition TEST drop will consist of 100-200 limited edition pieces.\n- The nounssentials 8 final designs, 400 piece drop will be done afterwards. \n\n*note: Scaling down production was considered, but even if the Nouns ecosystem doesn’t purchase the proposed amounts, LEBLANCSTUDIOS’ customer base will. They’ve shown excitement for the unique designs they’ve never seen before. It’s crucial for us to begin working on the next collection batch right after the test drop. Going through another proposal process, which would cause weeks of funding delay, wouldn’t be optimal for securing production spots and establishing dates with the manufacturers by paying upfront.*\n\n**Quality and Sustainability**: \n- The wears.wtf team has prioritized finding the best sustainable quality/price ratio for the garments. \n- We are in contact with reputable manufacturers to ensure ethically made clothing, and that the final products are not only stylish and comfortable but also durable. \n\n**Community Feedback and Iteration**: \n- Throughout the design process, the team will engage with the community through twitter & discord (JUNGLE, NOUNISH, NOUNCIL) to gather feedback on the proposed designs.\n-  By conducting polls, discussions, and sharing design mockups, the team will ensure that the community's preferences and ideas are taken into account. This iterative approach will help refine the designs, making them more appealing to the community members.\n\n**Launching the First Collection**: \n- Once the designs are finalized and produced, the first drop of the wears.wtf collection will be launched. This collection will focus on creating clothing that embodies the \"Clothing, Every Day, Forever\" concept, making it an essential piece for every Nouns community member's wardrobe. \n- By offering versatile and stylish garments, the collection aims to become an integral part of the community members' daily lives, allowing them to express their Nounishness.\n\n\n## **CLOTHING, EVERYDAY, FOREVER** \n\n### **NOUNSSENTIALS: Made for everyone. For Everyday, Forever.**\n- **Essential clothes** **made** **from sustainable materials** include items like organic cotton t-shirts, hemp or linen pants, and bamboo socks. By choosing sustainable materials for our everyday clothing, we can make a positive impact on the environment while also staying comfortable and stylish.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BYTzO1m.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CkvjwWq.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YTMLZ8S.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qKRb4am.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GJUnNn6.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5FphJbM.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AQcSXGn.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tJYYR8Q.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DU75H6a.png)\n*THESE ARE NOT FINAL DESIGNS*\n\n\n### **NOUNSWEAR: Creative Expression**\n- NOUNSWEAR **aims to explore the streetwear and artistic aspects of clothing**, emphasizing creativity, unique designs, and personal expression, which caters to those looking to make a bold fashion statement. It will follow a drop-by-drop format with limited edition pieces, taking into account essential Nounish activities and accomplishments. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/L4okh4b.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ufqJU9Z.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5UUylyH.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PjQzU3b.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Vhzfy8j.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HGnwvMa.png)\n*THESE ARE NOT FINAL DESIGNS*\n\n\n### **NOUNSJACKET: Nounish Representation**\n\n- The NOUNSJACKET **aims to be a set of tailor made jacket for different NOUNISH BUILDERS that have constant exposure to a wide audience** (Nouns Fair, Aubtoshi, Becco, Nounsesports, etc).\n- The jackets will be designed through back and forth conversations with differet builders about their preferences and the representative elements they would like in their jackets.

These collections will be crafted by experienced designers who prioritize the use of high-quality fabrics and materials, ensuring a more comfortable and durable experience. \n- Moreover, ready-to-wear pieces will be meticulously designed with silhouette, fit, and proportion in mind, providing a better overall fit and feel. **The versatility of ready-to-wear clothing makes it easy for consumers to incorporate these pieces into their daily wardrobe**, as they offer a range of styles that can be easily mixed and matched.\n\n\n## **WHAT DOES A CC0 CLOTHING BRAND LOOK LIKE?**\n- We believe that wears⌐◨-◨.wtf has the potential to innovate in fashion by leveraging CC0 assets to create unique and innovative clothing designs. \n- By incorporating elements from various web3 projects and the broader public domain, wears.wtf can develop a diverse range of apparel that reflects the creative spirit of the internet and empowers individuals to express their unique identities.\n- As Nouns allows for this CC0-POWERED clothing brand, integration and collaboration with other artists, brands, and CC0 projects can lead to outstanding success by exploring a niche with a format that no one is currently exploring. \n\n\n## **TIMELINE [PROOF-OF-DEMAND]**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CqaF99V.png)\n*TOTAL 26 WEEKS*\n*AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE: EARLY NOVEMBER*\n\n\n## **PHASE 2: [PRODUCTION EXPANSION]** \n- The subsequent proposal will focus on funding a larger production and adopting a more targeted approach, informed by the metrics gathered during this initial phase.

Together with LEBLANCSTUDIOS, we're dedicated to creating high-quality products that people will love not just for the designs, but for the quality as well.\n\n***Wears.wtf aims to establish itself as a valuable platform powered by Nouns, with the goal of creating a long-term project that benefits not only the Nouns ecosystem but also the broader web3 community.***\n\n## **BUDGET** \n![](https://i.imgur.com/UMjOx50.png)\n\n*Budget for phase 2 will be measurable once we have all of the metrics that will be provided by this first proposal.*"},{"blockNumber":17174853,"blockHash":"0x5437d0fe61e78b2048910d1fd6ead2e42790a54af80ef02e7ef0ffae30cc2b77","transactionIndex":120,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x7748075565d346dbe4e831cde1de1554150deed433a517cfda7eecd180d13ace","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":284,"proposer":"0x9AE8912ea6562957043c8d048641Aa9B450c397f","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000ba5e28a2d1c8cf67ac9e0dfc850dc8b7b21a4de200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000009c7652400"],"startBlock":17210853,"endBlock":17246853,"description":"# Let’s Throw a Global Pizza Party!

We’re requesting $42,000 in funding to support PizzaDAO’s third global pizza party for [Bitcoin Pizza Day](https://twitter.com/RarePizzas/status/1528475500993208323) on May 22, 2023. Through this grant we’re seeking to co-brand Nouns x PizzaDAO’s Bitcoin Pizza Day events currently being organized in 90+ cities around the globe.\n\nAll funds collected through this grant will go towards purchasing pizza from independent pizzerias on Bitcoin Pizza Day for our pizza parties all over the world. [Learn more about PizzaDAO and Rare Pizzas here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNdbUERvVN4)\n\n## TLDR ⌐◧-◧\n\nThis proposal directly funds 12,000+ slices of pizza that will be distributed through local PizzaDAO events and community organizations on May 22, 2023.\n\n1. **Nounifying Bitcoin Pizza Day** Onboarding communities one slice at a time. Co-branding marketing materials, events, and media reaching tens of thousands of participants globally.\n2. **Nounish Pizza Parties** Proliferation through pizza and furthering Nouns OTG presence at PizzaDAO events\n3. **Nounish Social Activation** Nouns x PizzaDAO claimable NFT for event participants and online proliferators\n\n\n\n\n\n![Pizza Noun 292 and Molto Benny|690x345, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/CxvDXsy5/1.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe that PizzaDAO is well-aligned as a Nounish brand partner for Nouns and our Global Pizza Party for Bitcoin Pizza Day provides a low-risk opportunity to advance proliferation of Nouns through earned media and activations at IRL events – all while doing some good and bringing people together with free pizza.\n\nPizzaDAO has been an active member of the Nounish community with our pizza parties at web3 conference events and in the Nounish community more broadly. This funding proposal would cement the vibes and values of PizzaDAO and Nouns together as well as spread the messages of community and funding weird stuff around the globe.\n\nPizzaDAO recently joined Nouns as a new member sub-DAO through the acquisition of the \"We Pizza\" Noun 292 and is committed to expanding the Nounish ecosystem through its events and network of contributors.\n\n\n![Pizza taste better when wearing Noggles |690x345, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/zDnh8rm9/2.png)\n\n\n\n\n## WHO WE ARE ⌐◧-◧\n\nWe are a global community of hackers, pizza enthusiasts, NFT creators, collectors, artists and rebels who believe in using crypto to make the world a better place.\n\nPizzaDAO’s community is made up of new entrants to the industry and members that have been in the crypto space for years, including several NounsDAO members, early Bitcoin community organizers, Gitcoin KERNEL Fellows, and past award recipients. PizzaDAO alumni now work on countless other projects in the crypto space, a direct result of our commitment to education and onboarding.\n\n### Let's Form Group Collab.Land Mini-Doc ⌐◧-◧\n\n\n\n\n[![Snax.eth / Noun 292 |690x348](https://i.postimg.cc/0yvF49fx/Screenshot-050223-011515-PM.jpg)](https://youtu.be/qNdbUERvVN4)\n\n\n\n\n\n## OUR IMPACT ⌐◧-◧\n\nTo date, PizzaDAO has given away over $600,000 worth of real, edible pizza in more than 75 countries. You might have eaten some during previous global pizza parties or at NFT.NYC, DCentral Miami, NFT Paris, NFT Sydney, ETHDenver, SXSW, NFTLA, Consensus, or one of the many smaller events we've supported. Now, we need your help!\n\n* Over 200,000 slices served\n* Over 500 pizzerias supported\n* Presence in 75+ countries\n* Thousands of people onboarded to web3\n* Over $600,000 of pizza given away!\n\n![PizzaDAO Global Party Map|690x260, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/9Q4FXdRr/Screenshot-2023-04-24-at-4-08-32-PM.png)\n\n\n## OUR MODEL ⌐◧-◧\n\nRare Pizzas is a cc0 project founded by the decentralized autonomous organization PizzaDAO. We came together on February 18th, 2021 to make 10,000 generative pizzas in a one-of-a-kind collaboration between 314 international toppings artists. This collaboration has gone on to raise over $1M through the sale of the NFTs, funding two global pizza parties and a large number of community events. As we build, our ultimate goal is to build solutions for independent pizzerias (software, marketing, consulting, etc.) and eventually conduct individual token-raises to enable communities to buy out their local pizzeria’s landlord and sign a rental contract with the pizzeria.\n\nLook beneath the hood of our pizza planning by visiting [parties.pizzadao.xyz](http://parties.pizzadao.xyz) and [playbook.pizzadao.xyz](http://playbook.pizzadao.xyz)\n\n## Nouns x PizzaDAO Bitcoin Pizza Day 2023 ⌐◧-◧\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day is already the one de facto crypto holiday. Together as a community, we can grow this celebration of cryptocurrency and pizza into a truly global event. The internet, cryptocurrency, and pizza are all global phenomena. Bringing them together by giving away free pizza funded by the blockchain is a strong invitation to the general public to join our ecosystem. We think that’s pretty Nounish!\n\n![PizzaDAO Global Pizza Party 2022 on an active volcano|690x407, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/V6FzZ4TH/Screenshot-2023-04-24-at-4-24-19-PM.png)\n\n### Nounifying Bitcoin Pizza Day ⌐◧-◧\n\nWe want to onboard communities one slice at a time. Our goal is to Nounify Bitcoin Pizza Day while creating touch points with potential collaborators through IRL activations at community events. Nouns assets will be integrated throughout PizzaDAO’s marketing materials, events, and branding to highlight the partnership, presenting Nouns as the core contributor for PizzaDAO’s global pizza party 2023.\n\n![Molto Benny x Nouns|649x322, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/qv9BNNyQ/Screenshot-2023-04-24-at-4-19-21-PM.png)\n\n\n### Nounish Pizza Parties ⌐◧-◧\n\nHaving Nounish gear present at our pizza parties makes a lasting impression on our guests. Nouns Pizza Party Kits featuring props and swag will be sent to organizers to allow attendees to participate in Nounish photobooths and other IRL activations. Parties will also feature cardboard cutouts of PizzaDAO’s \"We Pizza\" Noun #292 and co-branded material will be visible to attendees throughout the event and on social media. We had a strong Nounish presence at our Wen Pizza? party during NFT NYC and  a similarly strong presence at our event during Consensus ATX (we ordered a $600 box of Noun props from Big Shot Toyworks). See the results in videos like [this one](https://twitter.com/Pizza_DAO/status/1652495611445354497), which has over 8k views so far.\n\n![Nouns photobooth at PizzaDAO's NFTNYC party|690x460, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/4yfSjpnN/1681422067825.jpg)\n\n\n### Nounish Social Activation ⌐◧-◧\n\nNouns x PizzaDAO NFTs designed by Nounish builder BigShotToyWorks featuring PizzaDAO’s pizza noun #292. QR code signs will be displayed at premier parties featuring PizzaDAO x Nouns Global Pizza Party branding to allow participants to claim a “PizzaNounies” NFT.\n\n![PizzaNounies NFT|500x500, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/GtGRKFB7/image-1.png)\n\n\n\n### **WHY?**  ⌐◧-◧\n\nWe’re helping pizzerias around the world use crypto to empower their businesses while giving back to their communities. We believe that we can assist businesses to become community owned by tokenizing the pizzerias in our network using open source technology. Beyond that, we believe that pizza is a public good and that Rare Pizzas’ Art to Pizza model can be replicated to solve some of the world’s biggest problems while spreading joy (and sauce).\n\nWe created our Global Pizza Party as an accessible and fun way to get introduced to and utilize blockchain technologies. Plus, throwing a global pizza party is a good team-building exercise for Spaceship Earth!\n\n* We believe markets can be positive sum and can enrich communities\n* We believe that we can use digital scarcity to bring analog plenty\n* We believe artists deserve to be honored and compensated\n* We believe anyone should be allowed to help others without asking for permission\n* We believe memes are powerful vessels for raising awareness\n* We believe in equal inclusion of all pizza toppings (yes, even pineapple)\n\n## FUNDING BREAKDOWN ⌐◧-◧\n\n15% of funds collected through this grant will be used to purchase Nouns Pizza Party Kits containing Nouns swag and props from BigShotToyWorks. The remaining 85% of the funds collected through this grant will be used to purchase pizza from independent pizzerias all over the world for our events.\n\n![Funding Breakdown](https://i.postimg.cc/6QCJNRxJ/Screenshot-2023-05-02-at-1-28-59-PM.png)\n\n\n**Nouns Pizza Party Kits:**\n [Plastic Noggles ](https://bigshottoyshop.com/products/noggles-10pc-carton-red)\n[Paper Noggles](https://bigshottoyshop.com/products/nouns-paper-glasses-50-pack)\n[Noggle Pins ](https://bigshottoyshop.com/products/nouns-glasses-100-pack)\n\n## MULTISIG ⌐◧-◧\n\nFunds will be distributed to PizzaDAO.eth and supervised by Nounish countributors: \n* Snax\n* 87Bones \n* Oni\n* BigShotToyWorks\n* ProfWerder\n\n### “We Pizza” Noun 292\n![Noun 292|506x500, 50%](https://i.postimg.cc/m2pgGXrv/Screenshot-2023-04-30-at-10-20-16-PM.png)\n\n### Snax (PizzaDAO Founder)\n![Snax.eth x Nogglels|399x500, 50%](https://i.postimg.cc/W1sCXTjj/83767962-ae56-4881-b878-efa0edb64922.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n"},{"blockNumber":17204546,"blockHash":"0x092baa9812cd1670d2994505deff7b42e397b18e7e2eb0c0d8768bb227e09447","transactionIndex":56,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x2e239a0cb51b4b5af6f97e3e2e243999622ce538281365bf568687c364680d9e","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":285,"proposer":"0x67a690caf73aE9381D09bE6F1ce584bbe49D788A","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x00000000000000000000000067a690caf73ae9381d09be6f1ce584bbe49d788a00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014f46b0400"],"startBlock":17240546,"endBlock":17276546,"description":"# 🇧🇷 NFT.Brasil - Taking Over São Paulo and Celebrating the Brazilian Community\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cNvhtov.png)\n\n## TL:DR \n\nNouns leads the NFT movement in Brazil thanks to its community, but we are just getting started. We are proposing a huge Sao Paulo city takeover starting in NFT.Brasil event.\n\nOur goal is to achieve a massive and innovative onboarding experience for all attendees, and to do so, we will be present in five strategic areas throughout the event journey. These include the NFT Exhibition, Speaker Sessions, Lounge, Metaverse, and Street Gallery ([Eletromedia](https://eletromidia.com.br/) OOH advertising). \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3CH4aRq.png)\n\nNFT.Brasil is a pioneering conference celebrating the cutting-edge advancements and possibilities of the NFT world that is set to take place in Sao Paulo city, **Brazil on June 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, 2023.**\n\nWe want to bring Nouns to NFT.Brasil. The event is expected to attract over 30,000 individuals.

It was designed by the legendary Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and was first opened in 1951 to host the São Paulo Art Biennial, which is one of the world's most prestigious art exhibitions. \n\nHosting the NFT.Brasil conference at the Bienal is a testament to the venue's reputation as a premier cultural destination, and it promises to be an ideal setting for the fusion of art and technology that is at the heart of the NFT movement.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0gS9Ksp.jpg)\n\nThe event will be held on June 2nd, 3rd, and 4th and will be divided into two areas. The NFT exhibition will showcase Brazilian and international artists, collections, projects, and DAOs. The second area will host talks and lectures, bringing the community together to discuss the technology and its impact on our present and future. With a combination of NFT art exhibitions and speaker sessions, the event expects to attract over 30,000 individuals seeking knowledge, connections, and business opportunities in the field.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GupEgWM.jpg)\n\nWith a population of over 12 million residents, São Paulo is one of the largest and most vibrant cities in the world, making it the perfect backdrop for this exciting event. \n\n## What does Nouns gets by funding this proposal?\n\nBesides being a huge celebration of the Nouns community in Brazil and what we've been building for 9 months after NFT.Rio, and also being a great chance to bring new people on board, Nouns DAO will get:\n\n### Open-air NFT exhibition - [Eletromedia](https://eletromidia.com.br/)\n\nFor 20 days, NFT.Brasil will host the largest open-air NFT exhibition in the world. In partnership with Eletromedia, Brazil's leading Out of Home media company, NFT.Brasil will showcase artists' works at over 40,000 media spots throughout the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, and Fortaleza. \n\nWe want Nouns to be a part of this activation. **Last year at NFT.Rio, the same exhibition setup led the Nouns 367 sale bought by Sanuxo for 113.22 ETH.**\n\n### **PS:** Although what Eletromedia deliver in outreach is worth 400k USD, we've tailored a special nounish activation to just $25k.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HrGlQ5F.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gtsn3ig.jpg)\n\n#### Distribution of Eletromidia Presence in Sao Paulo\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ydOnnUg.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Q1BghWr.png)\n\nOver 40,000 media spots throughout four big cities in Brazil, with a total population of **24,3 million people.**\n\n### Nouns Lounge\n\nThe 25m² lounge will be comfortable and have an inviting atmosphere for attendees to gather. The space will feature puffs, chairs, and tables strategically arranged to showcase the websites, auctions, and content from some nounish projects: **Nouns**, **Foodnouns**, **Gnars**, **Lil Nouns**, and **Nouns BR**. The lounge is sure to be a must-visit destination for event-goers seeking the latest information and updates on Nouns and its innovative projects. A perfect place to onboard new people into the ecosystem.\n\nThe lounge will be inspired by the amazing work [Nouns Amigos](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos) is doing with the Nouns Fair.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M9w2gmk.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eA7Fk2t.png)\n\nThe decision to locate the lounge right beside the speakers is a badass choice for several reasons.  It **puts Nouns at the heart of the event**, giving unrivaled **visibility** and **exposure**. Attendees will be drawn to the dynamic atmosphere around the speakers, and we will be perfectly positioned to engage with them as they move in and out of the area. Such special location will enable Nouns to build the brand and network. Three members of Nouns BR (JP, Guiriba and Debussy) will be there to welcome and onboard people who pass by the lounge. Additionally, we have planned some exciting magnet activations that are sure to grab the attention of passersby and draw them to our lounge.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BlLWPOD.png)\n\n\n### Metaverse\n\nNFT.Brasil is creating a metaverse in either Cryptovoxels and Spatial, designed by the talented metarchitect Fabio Ema. During the four-day IRL event, everything will be broadcasted there. After that, the NFT.Brasil team will keep it active for three months with online events, and the community will be able to use it as they see fit, forever. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6cJJdRG.gif)\n\nMake sure to watch the [full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FfSsVZsFZM)!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LQ8o9JA.jpg)\n\n\nWhen we say take over São Paulo, we mean it.

After the event, the Nouns building and avatars will be a legacy for the DAO. We are going to airdrop the building token in the wallet of all voters and also we will make the Nouns heads available as avatars, so anyone can be voxel-nounified to attend our metaverse agenda.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/x64jCWN/ezgif-com-video-to-gif.gif)\n\n### Main Stage\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dRT2vCC.jpg)\n\n\nAubtoshi is an exciting addition to the lineup of main stage speakers at the upcoming NFT.Brasil event. As a highly influential figure in the Nouns community, Aubtoshi's presentation is sure to be a highlight of the event. Her expertise and experience within the Nouns ecosystem will provide valuable insights for attendees, while her engaging speaking style and natural charisma are sure to captivate the audience. \n\nWe'll also have a builders panel with Nouns BR members such as JP, Guiriba, Debussy, Vlad and others. They will tell  their stories within the ecosystem and invite the audience to join the Nouns community.\n\n### NFT.Brasil Exhibition\n\nNFT.Brasil is excited to announce that the upcoming exhibition will feature an exclusive art display by Nouns, alongside other highly respected collections such as Crypto Punks, and Doodles, BAYC and of course innovative navite brazilian collections. As one of the featured collections, Nouns will have a prominent position in the exhibition, offering visitors a chance to explore the ecosystem and engage with Nouns team. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uVh9ccj.png)\n\n**Building community, Every Day, Forever**\n\nThis event is not only a celebration of our achievements so far, but also a unique opportunity to showcase Nouns brand to millions of people across Brazil's largest cities for several weeks. As the biggest NFT event in the country, we have the chance to onboard thousands of new community members and take Nouns community in Brazil to the next level.\n\n## Budget Breakout in USDC \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9romoyN.png)\n\n### - **NFT.Brasil Sponsorship**\n\n- Sponsorship Package T - $ 30.000,00\n    - Exhibition entry granted for Nouns holders and sub-DAOs holders\n    - 20 passports for 3-day event access (raffled off to the Brazilian community)\n    - Main stage speaker (Aubtoshi)\n    - Secondary stage talk (Builders panel)\n    - Brand exposure on social media and website\n    - Brand exposure within the event\n    - 25m² lounge\n    - 1 Twitter Spaces\n\n- Metaverse Construction - $ 10.000,00\n    - Exclusive Nouns building in the NFT.Brasil District on Spatial and Cryptovoxels\n    - Nouns activations in both metaverses during the event and for three months more\n\n- Street Galery - $ 25.000,00\n    - Eletromedia (OOH media in 4 capitals)\n    - 20 days, NFT.Brasil will host the largest open-air NFT exhibition in the world\n    - 40,000 media spots throughout the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, and Fortaleza\n\n\n### - **Nouns Activation**\n\n- Lounge Construction - $ 12.000,00\n    - 25m² Lounge - We will create a lounge entirely with the Nouns' vibe, with TVs broadcasting live auctions, comfortable bean bags for everyone to cozy up, lots of Nouns around for everyone to take pictures.

Nouns Wet Wipes will become a permanent item in the market after this initial investment of **USD 31,450** + **2 ETH** (up from USD 19,050 prop 265).\n\n# Overview\nNouns Wet Wipes!! \n*It defends* (Against bacteria & viruses)!!\n*It protects* (Against bacteria & viruses)!!\n*It moisturizes* (Dry skin)!!\n*Now it spreads* (The Nouns Brand) !!!\n\n![B2](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52872018760_9b5f0a4406_c.jpg)\n\n# Goals\n1. Bringing Noun Wet Wipes to the masses, one pocket at a time!\n2. A thoughtful token to be given out during events.\n3. Inexpensive way of marketing the Noun’s brand to the public.\n4. After initial investment into print drums, the wet wipes can continuously be produced at a low cost, increasing Brand Awareness perpetually.\n\n# Details\nNothing beats the branding effect of a product that one carries around all day. Using these wipes will remind you of the Noun brand no matter where you are. Having these Nouns Wet Wipes sold near the checkout counters will definitely have an impact on brand awareness. With our custom eye catching wrapper, you just can’t miss it!\n\n**In our first prop we left out a lot of information which we thought (at that time) wasn’t really important or just minor details. We apologize and we have added them into this prop.**\n\n\n **WHY WIPES?**\n1. It's one of the common things you would carry around such as your keys, wallet, phone and sanitiser. A reminder of the Noun’s brand whenever you use it!\n2. Economical to give away during events. Has utility so won’t be thrown away once you get home from the events.\n3. Small enough to be easily displayed at the Checkout counters for maximum exposure.\n4. Have enough space on the back of the item to incorporate a qr-code.\n5. Something our team has experience working with!\n\n**PACK SIZE 8’s Consideration**\n\n***Why 8’s?***\n\n1. This is the pack size that most will carry around. Unless you have a baby then a bigger pack size is required during diaper changes, but we are not doing that here… yet!\n2. This is the pack size that takes up little space so it can be displayed at the checkout counter. \n3. Checkout counter sales are mostly ‘impulse’ buys and thus less price sensitive. As you move up the pack size, customers become more price sensitive. We have not reached scale production, therefore we cannot produce them at the lowest cost possible and thus need to target the less price sensitive range.\n4. Lowest cost to be given out at events.\n\n**Marketing Considerations**\nInitially we weren’t planning on asking for a big marketing budget, however it seems to be one of the biggest reasons for rejection of prop265. \n\n**Our initial plan**\nSell into retail outlets at cost to proliferate. We know (from sales data, can’t share where from sorry >_<) that wet wipes **average sales** per month at checkout counters (or POS = Point of Sale as we call it) are around **30** packs per month. \nWe have (110 cartons x 144 packs) 15,840 packs to sell off. \n- It will take 528 POS one month to sell off.\n- Or 44 POS per year. \n- 44 POS = 22 retail outlets with a minimum of 2 POS each.\n\n22 outlets is a very, very doable number just with our contacts alone, but it will take **ONE YEAR’s** time without any additional marketing funding. As some suggest we sell out in a shorter time frame, we shall therefore request a budget for marketing.\n\n## New Marketing Initiative\n**Goals**\n- To sell all wet wipes in **ONE MONTH**. Based on healthcare retail data, a distribution chain of 200 outlets yields close to $150 million in total revenue per annum. Through our networks, deploying to 110 outlets on day one is possible. That way, our product holding period will be kept to a minimum (< 30 days). \n- To incentivise the outlets to let out prime retail shelf space, we developed an extra budget to “rent” their prime-est location, which is their point of sale (POS) aka cashier counter location to display our impulse purchase / daily necessity item. Making it easier to reach the customers.\n- To boost the nounish branding and create a movement. Leveraging on the power of social media and the attractiveness of prizes.\n\n**‘Sell Out’ in 1 Month**\nIdeally, the wipes should be sold out within a month. With our current contacts, we should be able to ‘sell-in’ to 120 outlets nationwide but to further increase exposure, we will be renting *prime* space within the retail outlets.\n\n**‘Renting’ Prime Space - Cost USD 6,000**\nWe will pay for prime POS display space at certain higher volume retail outlets to greatly increase exposure. 3-month’s display will only cost around USD 60 per POS space (thanks to its small size). We plan to ‘rent’ 100 prime POS display spaces which would cost USD 6,000.\n\n![Prime Area](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52871984559_d00d9e56f7_c.jpg)\n***Example of prime retail space circled in red***\n\nThe moment we sell 80% of the wipes, we would make another batch. No cost to the DAO as it will be paid for from the sales of the first batch. This Prop is self sustaining and will continue to proliferate the Nouns Brand as long as we sell out and make new batches.\n\n**Social Media Marketing - Cost USD 650 + 1 Carton of Wipes**\nThe main objective of the marketing campaigns is to reach the local and online population rapidly and ***encourage community participation to proliferate*** the nouns brand.\n\n- Like & Share incentive: This campaign will be targeted at our retail partners, to share our content to their network, at a small incentive of $50 per quarter.  (Limited to 10 participating partners)\n- Video creation incentive: We will run an online 10 second video format contest for everyone to submit, and we will pick a winner and reward them with a $50 prize. (One per month for 3 months)\n- One carton of wipes will be set aside as the prizes for fun contests such as “Spot our Wipes in the Wild”, Fun Photo Submissions for customers who bought the wipes and uploaded in social media, etc.\n\n\n**Design Considerations**\nAgain initially we weren't going to spend much on design since it was going to be a minimum viable product (MVP), design would just increase the initial cost as well as the running cost of the product. Our experience with wet wipes was that as long as it had an eye-catching color and the word ‘wipes’ was visible, it would sell at the POS counter. Packaging design was low on our list of priorities. A quick search on Amazon would reveal that the best selling wipes have a simple and minimalistic design.\n\n![Original Wrapper](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52799159996_17b91fb903_c.jpg)\n***Original wrapper design from Prop 265***\n\nThe original wrapper’s simple design (F) and single color was chosen with the costing of the print drum in mind. Every color we add to the wrapper increases the cost of the print drum significantly. \n\nHowever the DAO has spoken. A minimum standard of design must be followed as hot.4156.eth replied in the vote, and so we shall deliver. We shall set a high bar for these wipes and our future product development designs.\n\nWe will increase the number of colors for the design of the wrapper from 1 color in Prop 265 to 5 colors. We will be asking for funding for 5 colors, if however the chosen design has less than 5 colors, the extra funds would be sent back to the DAO treasury.\n\n**Design Contest** *[Link](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/design-win-eth-nouns-wet-wipes-design-contest/4411/19)*\nWe have received input from some very helpful friends and the community that design cost may spiral out of control and that the results are still not guaranteed. So as to not go overboard with the design budget while retaining control over how much we pay, we have opted for a ‘Community Design Contest’ style of choosing and paying for the design. \n\nPayment will be fixed at **2 Eth** for the designs of the wipes. Since there are 4 components of the design that are required for wipes we think it’s fair for the winning design to receive 1.5 Eth while 0.5 Eth will be split among the top 2-5 designers.\nThe four parts of the design.\n\n1. The wrapper\n2. The flap\n3. The box for holding 12 packs\n4. The 3D mockup of the product\n\n**The Contest Judges**\nThe judges of this contest would be the DAO itself so please choose which design you like best and let us know in the ‘Reason’ section when you vote. We will also take into account ‘Against’ votes if you did choose the design you like. 1 noun 1 vote. \n\n![Reason](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52872458095_478bc5e60f_z.jpg)\n\n# Distribution to Nouns DAO Events\n39 cartons of the wet wipes will be reserved for the events Nouns DAO has committed to attending (example: PROP 206) as well as future events that require merch to be given out. We will collect USD 5000 as shipping for this purpose, any leftovers will be returned to the DAO. If there’s a shortfall, the event organizers can pay the shipping to get it.\n\n# Specifications\nEach Pack will consist of 8 pcs of fragrance-free antibacterial wet wipe.\n\n- Wipes size: 150mm x 140mm\n- 12 packs in a Display Box \n- 12 boxes in a carton. Each carton contains 144 packs of wipes (8pcs)\n- Minimum order quantity (MOQ) for each run is 150 cartons.\n- Ingredients: Aqua, Propylene Glycol, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Polysorbate 20, Benzalkonium Chloride, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopheryl Acetate and a bit of Nounishness ⌐◨-◨\n\nWet wipes will be manufactured by our vetted local manufacturer in Malaysia which are certified GMP ISO 22716:2007 & QMS ISO 9001:2015\n\n\n# Costing\n1. Design cost ------------------------------------------------------- 2 ETH\n2. Marketing cost\n    a. ‘Rent’ prime POS for maximum exposure—----------------- USD 6,000\n    b. Social media marketing —------------------------------------ USD 650\n3. Print drum for nouns sticker design (one-time cost) ---------- USD 2,000\n4. Custom wet wipes wrapper print mold (one-time cost) ------- USD 8,500\n5. Display Box mold  -------------------------------------------- USD 1,500\n6. 150 cartons of wet wipes (USD 52 per carton) ---------------- USD 7,800\n7. Shipping to 20 events around the world (2 cartons each) ----- USD 5,000\n\n**Total USD 31,450 + 2 ETH**\n\nPrint mold and drum prices increased from Prop 265 due to increased complexity and the number of colors of the designs. Printing costs also increased due to the increased colors thus increasing cost per carton from USD 49 to USD 52.\n\n# Team Remuneration\nWe plan to set the Recommended Retail Price of below USD 1 while making it worthwhile for retail outlets to sell. Our team will take the net proceeds (after deducting warehousing, logistic and distribution costs) from the sales of the 110 cartons (40 cartons reserved for events) as remuneration. If we don’t sell, we don’t get paid! \n\nFuture orders of this current design Noun wipes will cost significantly less as we already have the design and mold for the packaging.

WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?**\n\nThese colorful 3” tall mini figures are meant to be a fun, stylish, low cost, and non-crypto-based entry point into the world of “NOUNs.” **Nounish Friends** are uniquely styled modular figures which are packed into mystery boxes, eye-catching counter displays positioned for museum shops, high end retail and lifestyle shops worldwide.\n\nThese unique designs represent a perfect evolution of the NOUN PFP to a beautiful and playful tactile art object. (Note: This series will feature 6 unique heads.  Additional characters will be added with future releases or collaborations with other projects.)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WGKqT1P.jpg)\n\n**Why should Nouns fund these mini figures?**\n\nThese Nounish and high quality figures have a FUN modular play feature (interchangeable heads and glasses) that follows the unique building patterns of PFPs and creates infinite possibilities of fun and future extensions. The time is right to release a small colorful collection of figures like this to help promote NOUNS in all of their unique styles and interpretations. \n\n**A prop that assists future props:**\n\nThese mini figure designs are the type of product that will assist in any builders plans for proliferation. For example, David Horvath could use these in his activations in Japan and Korea, as well as NOTG and activations at Art Basel, ETHDenver & NFT London.\n\nCombined with the existing Bigshot Noggles and enamel pins, these mini figures round out a vibrant capsule collection of Nouns merch with mass appeal. This collection will be particularly useful for builders who are planning IRL activations around the world, and easily accessible since all items in the capsule can ship from one centralized location.\n\nThese items are currently being solicited worldwide to museum shops and boutique retail locations.  The feedback has been very positive in regards to design, quality and pricing, but the buyers all need a ship date and review samples before making any commitment to an unknown brand.  \n\nIf the prop is passed we should have these available for distribution all over the world by the end of the year!\n \n ![](https://i.imgur.com/15hqZeX.jpg)\n\n **What's the plan post-production?** \n\nWe have been in contact and actively soliciting retail/museum shop buyers, but they like to see something and order right away, so having production ready and a delivery schedule and final costs to present to them is imperative. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/h972zIu.jpg)\n\n**Who is Bigshot and why are they a solid choice for collectibles?**\n\n[BIGHSHOT TOYWORKS](https://www.bigshottoyworks.com/) has been making high end collectibles and art toys for over 25 years. We have worked with brands such as Nike, Microsoft and Blizzard, and artists like Mark Ryden, Jeff Soto, Steven Harrington and Futura 2000. Bigshot is the premier producer of collectibles like this. We are also behind [NOUNWORKS.WTF](https://www.nounworks.wtf/) and the iconic IRL Noggles.\n\n**II. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT COSTS:**\n\n**TOTAL ASK: $125,000**\n\n·      $65,000 for production of 6,000 units (666 sets of toys)\n·      $40,000 for project management, marketing, distribution\n·      $20,000 for logistics and warehousing\n\nMarketing & project management includes daily factory interactions, QC checks, sample reviews, and revisions, and all aspects of the project related to production. We also handle photography, press outreach, social media campaigns & engagement, client & partner onboarding & follow ups, warehousing, reasonable shipping for marketing opportunities worldwide as needed.\n\n\n**PAYMENT SCHEDULE:** \nUpon passing of Prop, full amount will be sent to Gnosis safe in USDC. Payments to be sent to Bigshot in 3 milestones as follows:\n• 40% upfront ($50,000 USD): pre-production & production deposit stages\n• 30% on Milestone 1 ($37,500 USD): production balance, testing, sea shipping, duties, project management, marketing\n• 30% on Milestone 2 ($37,500 USD): warehousing, logistics, marketing, proliferation management\n\n**PAYMENT DETAILS**\n• GNOSIS SAFE: USDC will be sent to a Gnosis Safe with the following signers:\nBigshot Klim, noun12.eth, sasqwash.eth\n• The USDC will be held in a multisig and be released to Bigshot when Milestones are completed.\nMultisig Adress: [0x7C9878E913d6AE8Fe8cf10783Ded77070b9cA68E](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7C9878E913d6AE8Fe8cf10783Ded77070b9cA68E)\n\n**III. FUTURE STEPS**\n\nOur 6000 physical toys will be utilized for both wholesale and retail sales for maximum reach and value. We believe that both are important aspect of this proof-of-concept model moving forward:\n\n• 10% of the production will be allocated to community members and other Nouns initiatives like STUDIO1 activation in JP, Nouns Deli, Nouns Amigos, Nouns Africa and Art Basel Miami etc.(Shipping not included) \n• Units to be sold in shops at approx $16/toy, or approx $9 wholesale + shipping. A portion of the sales will be used to develop series 2 and will be put forth in a new proposal if the project is a success.\n• Option for DAO allocated additional quantities from this edition at $9/unit\n• Option to re-order at lower unit cost in a future run.\n• Option to create unique colorways & revised single figure packaging for targeted events and activations with NOUNish events like ALPS Dao, Gnars Dao, NOUNS Amigos. NOTG and Potential POP-UP retail activations.\n• We'd like to have some expedited product available for San Diego Comic-Con and David's activations in Japan to showcase and promote Nouns in key places.\n• All of the items ship from a central location in the USA so the marketing and proliferation logistics are perfectly aligned.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/q7YhCLQ.jpg)\n\nPROJECT HISTORY:\n\n[Prop 72](https://houseofnouns.wtf/nouns/proposals/72) was funded with 20ETH to take this project from initial idea, through countless iterations, to the current designs & prototypes. We have communicated updates weekly on the Discord here and have had many conversations on Discourse here, gathering feedback from over 50 comments to arrive at the final designs proposed in Prop 141. \n \n[Prop 141](https://houseofnouns.wtf/nouns/proposals/141) had some heated contentious voting at 78 for and 88 against with the majority of the for votes coming from individual holders.\n\nProp 141 has identified some pain points for the Nouners that are being addressed here to secure funding for production, marketing and distribution of these blind box minifigures to the museum shops, boutiques and art toy shops and galleries worldwide.\n\nThank you so much for your support, we look forward to getting this prop on chain, and to get these figures to the world in time for the holidays.

Content Proliferation & Total Reach**\n  -  Number of **proliferation instances** of our content is leveraged by others (e.g. KTLA using our content as b-roll)\n  -  **Total Reach** - how many people saw our content\n  \t  -  **Why this metric?**  \n  \t  \t\t-  This contains both our own reach, and reach by content proliferation.\n  \t  \t\t-  This is a proxy for the usefulness & quality of our content.\n  \t  \t\t-  It will lead us to making our content as accessible and re-usable as possible.\n  -  **Season 2 Goals:** \n  \t\t-  200 Instances of proliferation (vs. 50 in season 1)\n  \t\t-  5M Reach (vs. 3.75M in season 1)\n  \t\n**2. Social Media Followers** \n  -  Total followers on @nounish social media accounts\n  \t\t-   **Why this metric?** \n  \t\t\t-   This represents affinity with our content and is a proxy to our success as a \"voice of the Nouns brand\"\n-   **Season 2 Goals:**\n\t\t-   16,000 followers (2x)\n**3. Minutes of content published**\n* **Why this metric?**\n\t* During Season 1 we learned that having a constraint of the type of video we commit to make (e.g. short form or long form) is inefficient\n\t* We think our high quality content minutes should be fungible and that we should be able to choose the type of content that best fits the story.\n\t* This is an output metric and not an outcome metric, but we think it's important for the DAO to get a sense of what quantity of high quality content can be expected from this prop. \n* **Season 2 Goals:** \n\t* 90 minutes of high quality videos delivered (~same as season 1)\n\n\n## Content Pipeline for Season 2\n\n**Writing**\n* Nouns funding Crypto Infra \n* Agora, Prop House, etc.    \n* Nouns is a radical governance experiment\n\t* Covering from the beginning of the DAO and climaxing at the DAO Split implementation\n* What Makes a Nouner Tick?\n    * Include many Nouners vision for the DAO, what makes a good proposal to them etc.\n* Nouns Deli\n \n**Filming**\n* Nouns Esports \n* Xanadu\n\n**Post production**\n* Danit Peleg\n* Rose Parade\n\n\n## Prop House\n\nInvesting in high quality content is super valuable for the DAO, but we also should tap into the power of decentralization to proliferate our content as well. \n\nThe [first Prop House Round](https://prop.house/nounish/growth-hacking-nounish-content) is live and we will be running more of these, both open and targeted rounds. \n\n![](https://imgur.com/efLuwFl.png)\n\n\n## Open Sourcing our Content\n\nAs part of our effort to lean into content proliferation, we will be working on making our content more accessible and easy to use. \n\nSimilar to how nounish gifs are so easy to use on social media, we want our video content to be as accessible and easy to remix and reuse by anyone. \n\nIt will be searchable with tags and key terms, like a stock photo website but for Nouns media and all of it is CC0.\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/U8qxFQ8.png)\n\n\n\n## Minting\n\nWe have started minting our work, to create a deeper connection with our content. The funds will be split between Nouns DAO and our distribution fund so that we can use the funds for further proliferation. \n\n![](https://imgur.com/mM1n6tk.png)\n\n\n## Team\n\nOur team consists of 10 people:\n* [Goldy](https://twitter.com/goldypix) - Lead\n* [142](https://twitter.com/noun142) - Lead\n* John - Creative Director / Editor\n* Haley - Executive Producer\n* Guy - Writer / Director / Editor\n* [Becco](https://twitter.com/Pixel_Becco) - Writer / Host\n* Meline - Producer / Editor\n* [Liam](https://twitter.com/LiamGordes) - Editor & VFX\n* [bk](https://twitter.com/0xbk_) - Social Media\n* 3 freelance helpers\n\n## About Pixel \nMost of our team is from [Pixel](https://pixel.melbourne/), a renowned boutique production company based in Melbourne, Australia. \n\nPixel is a perfect fit for Nouns -  they are experts in making tricky things happen, and believe that clever, complex, and wonderful ideas need nurturing from beginning to end.

a retrospective on our last prop\n\nWe want to share our challenges and learnings during season 1 to augment the conversation in the DAO and highlight opportunities for other teams. \n\nOur two top challenges, which we dealt with throughout season 1 are:\n\n1. **Explaining Nouns is very hard**\n\t* Nouns is a very layered topic that is hard to explain succinctly.\n\t* If it's too simplified, it becomes boring and doesn't make any sense.\n\t* Breaking it into parts is also challenging because Nouns makes sense only as one package.\n\t* Different audiences and different contexts require different explanations.\n\t* **Learnings:**\n\t\t* Continue spending a lot of cycles experimenting with different ways and formats to explain Nouns.\n\t\t* Continue iterating on messaging and observing what resonates.\n\n2. **Figuring out our target audience is challenging** \n\t* Initially we tried to target potential builders as our audience, but we felt that it wasn't capturing the opportunity of getting more nouners and fans on board. \n\t* Halfway through season 1 we landed on the thesis that we are looking to reach early adopters of crypto and new tech who will find the Nouns experiment appealing. \n\t* We still don't know exactly who  Nouns resonate with most and who we should target.\n\t\t* We are missing data on the funnel and believe the DAO should spend more resources on figuring this out systematically.\n\t* We grappled a lot with the question of how we get people to **care** about the story of Nouns and the things being built on it and become fans.\n\t* **Learnings:**\n\t\t* **We need more funnel data** - we would love to see a team propose a data project for Nouns to:\n\t\t\t* Understand **who are the builders, nouners, and fans** of the brand\n\t\t\t* Map out the \"customer journey\" of each of the audience segments identified\n\t\t* We are **open sourcing our content** to let more parallel experiments on different audiences, to be run by more teams \n\t\t* In our opinion, proposals need to focus on making people care about Nouns\n\t\t\t* Our belief is that public good funding is the easiest shortcut to make people care about Nouns.\n\nAdditional challenges & learnings: \n\n\n\n* **We didn't get enough input and feedback from Nouners from across the DAO**\n\t* We received feedback that during season 1 we didn't cover the breadth of what Nouns funds - and focused on mostly creative props. \n\t* We want to represent and cater to various parts of the DAO, and we need to do a better job getting inputs from Nouners with varied visions for what the DAO is.\n\t* We want our content to be neutral and do the best job to represent as much as possible from various points of view in the DAO.\n\t* **In Season 2:**\n\t\t* We will consult various DAO members to hear what content they think would be powerful and useful, as well as represent their varied vision for the DAO.\n\t\t* We will take our lead from the Tech Pod's approach to coming to the DAO with a slate update and getting a read on what the DAO wants to see and prioritising it. \n\n\n\n\n* **The logistics of proposals is hard to manage**\n\t* We have limited control over the stories that we are reporting about, and that can hurt our content pipeline.\n\t* With many props, the timelines are in flux and it's difficult to plan ahead.\n\t* **Learnings:**\n\t\t* We focused more on making original content such as the Mega Explainer & 100 nounish things (*a video to be published soon, before the prop goes on chain*)\n\t\t* We created a Shorts format that is not dependent on specific props\n\t\t* [Creative Absurd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oec19SUIyb8) focused on interviews and stories that are not dependent on delivery timing\n* **Over optimization around fast growth diminishes brand building** \n\t* When we focus too intently and on viral thumbnails & titles, it makes the brand cheaper\n\t* **Learning:**\n\t\t* We never want to get in a race to the bottom on virality.\n\t\t* We always want to be top of class in terms of our content, to maintain the Nouns brand as a premium brand.\n\t\t* We open source our content to let others also experiment with virality with less risk to the brand.\n\n* **Short form vs Long form and generally video formats** \n\t* Committing to a discrete number of videos, whether short or long, was a mistake:\n\t\t* Instead of thinking about how to maximize on content, we oftentimes focused too much on delivery formats and cadence.\n\t\t* We want to be free to experiment with more variations in lengths, format, style, and audiences.\n\t* **Learnings:**\n\t\t* We are shifting to a minutes-published goal and not a specific number of videos released.\n\t\t* We are shifting to a more open and experimental approach to what kind of videos we ship in terms of their content and story.\n\n* **It takes time to build momentum**\n\t* Ramping up internal momentum and onboarding our entire team took longer than expected - Nouns are hard to explain and to understand\n\t*  Building rapport and trust with builders and getting great content and input from them takes time.\n\t*  **Learnings**\n\t\t*  We believe that the DAO should hire world-class talent for long-term contracts to amortize the fixed cost of onboarding and momentum building\n\n\n\n# Stats\n\n## 3 million @nounish social media views\n\n* Out of 3M views, two videos stand out as outliers and got much more views than the rest:\n\t* [Taki from Nouns esports](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CreCH1zAR5Z/) -

Our goal is to make Nouns a highly recognizable brand among Chinese-speaking individuals and to inspire ambitious builders within this community to engage with the Protocol.\n\n**Objectives**:\n1. Introduce Nouns DAO to Chinese-speaking individuals interested in web3, serving as their gateway to the space.\n2. Offer a comprehensive understanding of Nouns to Chinese-speaking individuals curious about its concept.\n3. Facilitate the integration of new Chinese builders, inspiring and connecting them with existing builders to generate ambitious and impactful proposals.\n4. Highlight funded projects and empower the Chinese community to share our content and narrative within their own networks.\n5. Empower builders to leverage our content for seamless interactions with Chinese brands and non-crypto organizations.\n\n**Opportunity:**\nAs the world’s most populous country, boasting over 1.4 billion people, China offers a vast potential market for Nouns. The nation’s more than 1 billion active internet users and over 1.2 billion mobile phone users further amplify the tremendous opportunities available.\n\nWe feel distribution of existing content is a huge opportunity within the DAO. Our ambition is to continue to proliferate the meme throughout this expansive territory. The recent decision by the DAO to fund a series of activations across China has provided the perfect springboard for our efforts. We intend to build on this momentum by launching a comprehensive, multi-platform social media campaign, leveraging local marketing expertise to cultivate a significant and enduring Nounish community within the country.\n\n![CN Digital Population](https://i.imgur.com/F4MEB9h.png)\n\n**Strategy:**\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that China’s digital landscape is distinctly unique, as most Chinese internet users lack access to western online content. The nation boasts various platforms and services exclusive to its market. We understand that customizing our marketing and outreach initiatives to cater different segments of the Chinese market is vital. As such, we aim to meticulously consider cultural subtleties, regulations, preferences, and values of Chinese internet users in order to adapt our strategy effectively.\n\nGiven the vast expanse of China and the diverse demographics that Nouns can resonate with, it is essential to involve numerous content creators and create tailored content streams for this region. To accomplish this, Oni intends to visit China during the pilot phase, collaborating directly with SCG's team on the ground and immersing himself in the local culture and web3/art communities. We are confident that our multi-platform strategy, combined with in-depth marketing knowledge of the market, will enable us to successfully attain this objective.\n\n## SCG Group\nOur expertise lies in helping brands penetrate the Chinese market and expand their footprint. With more than a decade of experience introducing international brands and artists to China, we leverage our profound understanding of both Chinese and Western cultures, as well as slang and trends, to drive consistent and organic growth. To date, we have amassed over 27 million followers for Western brands and artists in China.\n\nAt SCG Group, we meticulously select our partners, much like how the Nouns community carefully reviews and votes for each prop. This is mainly due to the significant amount of human resources we invest in tailoring plans for each project.\n\nNevertheless, Nouns immediately captured our attention due to its unique blend of technology, branding, and collective community experimentation. We admire the art, the permissionless approach to IP, and we aspire to play a pivotal role in facilitating China’s integration into the global Nouns community. \n\n\n\n[![Nouns x SCG](https://i.imgur.com/UBoq5Dw.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUo2ljQmILQ) \n[Nouns x SCG in Time Square, New York City – February 26 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUo2ljQmILQ) \n*While visiting New York City earlier this year, SCG took the opportunity to create a fun video for placement on billboard in Times Square, highlighting a clip from The Wizard's Hat -- a recently funded nounish animated short.*\n\n## Core Team\n**Gedoumaru**: Founder & Managing Director of SCG\n![Gedoumaru](https://i.imgur.com/JgbmoQ6.jpg)\nWith over a decade of experience in driving growth for visionary brands and individuals across diverse markets, both in the East and the West, Gedoumaru has developed a unique set of skills that combines 1-on-1 guidance, strategic digital approach, and localized creative direction to help clients achieve significant and impactful growth.\n\nGedoumaru brings a unique and invaluable perspective to the team as she seamlessly bridges Eastern and Western cultures.

As a result, Chinese people have taken an interest in Jonas Blue and his work. Many content creators and influencers on social media platforms have spontaneously started recording and posting videos using his other songs, which has led to a couple of his other songs besides “By Your Side” going viral in China.\n\nFor example, more than 4,000 Douyin users have joined the \"Mama Challenge\" initiated by SCG under Jonas Blue's accounts. Each post has received an average of over 100,000 likes and 3,000 comments. The viral nature of this challenge has further promoted Jonas Blue's music and increased his reach in China.\n\n**Salvatore Ganacci**\n![Salvatore1](https://i.imgur.com/tOuAagj.png)\n\nTo build the profile of Salvatore Ganacci, a renowned Swedish artist with a distinctive, unconventional brand, in the Chinese market, we have undertaken a comprehensive effort to adapt and repurpose his contents to suit the local audience's sensibilities.\n\nOur approach has yielded excellent results, after reviewing his existing content we built the 3 videos listed above amassing a total of 25.3 million streams, 896,000 likes, and 55,432 comments.

It is an open-source, free, permission-less protocol that enables **Phased (milestone-based) or Periodic (recurring)** **payments**. This public good can support various payment modes, including peer-to-peer, DAO-to-DAO, community rounds, and grants without complex setup, shadow tokens, or intermediary protocol fees.\n\nNouns Stream does more than further the Nouns’ visual brand/meme; it helps push the ecosystem forward with easy-to-use public goods. This protocol has already been [audited by 0xMacro](https://0xmacro.com/library/audits/nouns-stream-1.html) and deployed across Ethereum ([Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB13Afc4f39942b885A00A60A02295016BF82d447#code), [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05#code)), Arbitrum ([Mainnet](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05), Goerli), Optimism ([Mainnet](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05), Goerli), Polygon ([Mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05), [Mumbai](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05)) and Base ([Goerli](https://goerli.basescan.org/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05)).\n\nThe protocol developers, who are also Nouns’ holders, are asking for a retroactive grant of **16 eth** to cover the cost of the audit (US$25,000 ie ~14 eth) and deployment (US$5,000 ie ~2 eth).\n\n![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/9g5l0ZE.png)\n\n# Problem\n\nNouns and Noun-ish DAOs have no recourse or control over outgoing funds due to a successful proposal. If a team fails to deliver or meet certain milestones, the community cannot vote to recall the remaining funds.\n\nMoreover, contributors to longer-running, phased projects need more certainty. Today they are forced to make a single, big ask for funding or create multiple proposals over the life of their project to secure continued funding. Unfortunately, such uncertainty doesn’t help set up ambitious developers, artists, and creators for success.\n\nLastly, as the community evolves, it may pay specific contributors— e.g., IRL Events Coordinator — a fixed amount per quarter, paid bi-weekly.\n\nWithin the community, we have seen a healthy debate between funding experiments to further the meme while keeping treasury spending in check. Tooling like Nouns Stream helps balance where milestone-based payments can commit to experiments and revert (via Proposal) if a project is not delivering the promised objectives.\n\n# Proposal\n\nThe Nouns Stream protocol is open-source, free, and permissionless. It allows anyone to set up an escrow account that is funded with funds later disbursed via one of two modes:\n\n1. Phased (i.e., milestone-based)\n2. Periodic (i.e., regular intervals)\n\nTo further clarify and formally define:\n\n1. **Phased:** these are milestone-based payments where the funds are set up to be disbursed in predefined amounts on fixed dates. The dates and amounts for each milestone are set up during contract deployment. Configuring payment amounts on a milestone basis allows for unique cases requiring larger upfront payments to bootstrap projects. For example, a proposal for 75 eth might be broken into four parts over some fixed dates like:\n    1. 04-10-2023: 35 eth\n    2. 04-20-2023: 5 eth\n    3. 04-30-2023: 15 eth\n    4. 05-15-2023: 20 eth\n2. **Periodic:** these are recurring payouts at fixed intervals defined in days or weeks. For example, a proposal could be set up to pay a community contributor 24 eth for the next three months (12 weeks) at two-week intervals, i.e., they will get paid 4 eth every two weeks from the escrow.\n\nThe Controller/Sender (e.g. Nouns Governor’s Contract in the case of Nouns DAO) is the only party that can cancel the escrow and recalls funds. The Receiver can’t withdraw funds before said strike dates. Such controls allow the community to create follow-up proposals and recall funds if a project is not believed to deliver on its promise long-term.\n\nThe protocol has a tipping mechanism where payments will be pushed to the receiving address if the payout is set up with a tip incentive. This avoids the need for Receiver to claim/withdraw funds. If no tip percentage is defined during contract deployment, the Receiver has to withdraw funds as they become available manually. Today, the tips are hard-coded to go to a fixed address. The developers will release an update within a few weeks where anyone who helps run these transactions can trigger transactions and earn tips.\n\nWith predictable payout timelines, Nouns Square can hold regular Demo Day sessions for projects to share progress against milestones 👀\n\nSome previous proposals that could’ve directly benefited from the proposed payment infrastructure include:\n\n- [Fund design, engineering, and community contributors](https://nouns.wtf/vote/17)\n- [Prop House Protocol: Public Infrastructure by Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105)\n- [Nounish Dataverse, open source data](https://nouns.wtf/vote/240)\n- [Nouns Deli Melbourne: Piloting a Nounish Franchise Model](https://nouns.wtf/vote/254)\n\nNouns Stream distinguishes from existing protocols such as Juicebox and Sablier through focused features, better user experience and Nounish visual branding:\n\n1. It is visually propagating the Nouns meme\n2. Providing a point-and-click user experience that any proposer can use to set up an escrow\n3. Leverages CREATE2 opcode to provide future contract address, thus eliminating the need to pre-emptively deploy contracts or setup streams before Proposal has passed\n4. Phased payment unlocks on pre-determined milestone dates\n5. Capability to setup different payment amount for each phase within project\n6. Zero fees, forever, and low gas\n7. No secondary token to swap and manage\n8. Sender/Controller fully controls the funds, i.e., DAO or multi-sig, who adds funds to the deployed contract\n\n# Deliverables & Ask\n\nEverything has been built as open source and under the GPL license. The deliverables include a developer (React) SDK, allowing other developers to under this infrastructure within their applications. In addition, 0xMacro has [audited](https://0xmacro.com/library/audits/nouns-stream-1.html) the project.\n\n**The total ask for this project is 16 eth.**\n\nThis funding will help the developers (retroactively) cover:\n\n- cost of the audit completed by 0xMacro (US$25,000 ie ~14 eth)\n- cost of contract deployment across all networks (US$5,000 ie ~2 eth)\n\nIn the future, the developers want to extend Nouns Build and add these payout options natively (via pull request) to the project. However, this Proposal doesn’t ask for funding for any such future development:\n\n![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/3OVz9Ll.png)\n\n# Contributors\n\nMatthew (evav.eth, Noun#604, LilNoun#5834+5, Builder#67, Gnar#3750): 5+ years as blockchain engineer who has worked on various protocols including [Burrata.xyz](http://Burrata.xyz).\n\nOsama (osama.eth, osamakhan.eth, Noun#463, LilNoun#5703, Builder#54, Gnar#553): 2+ years blockchain product/engineering and has helped build [OlympusDAO.finance](http://OlympusDAO.finance) and [Burrata.xyz](http://Burrata.xyz). \n\nOsama and Matthew have also been involved in the founding of Purple DAO — flagship Nouns Build DAO based around the Farcaster network."},{"blockNumber":17235705,"blockHash":"0x3beb7f04906858f2073b07bb32974c9ff6966dfb7feb0a821286d8d15ce13bfd","transactionIndex":45,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xc17cafdcd6fcf3713afe42e57a185d2ab3114b0e91b20188b4734ca9ff5991a5","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":292,"proposer":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","targets":["0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":17271705,"endBlock":17307705,"description":"# Refill voteRefund balance\n\nThe voteRefund function is important for the health and integrity of the DAO as it helps maintain a diverse voter base and combat voter apathy.\n\nThe contract was initially funded ~7 months ago with 12 eth.

With a combination of NFT art exhibitions and speaker sessions, the event expects to attract over 30,000 individuals seeking knowledge, connections, and business opportunities in the field. São Paulo is one of the largest and most vibrant cities in the world, making it the perfect backdrop for this exciting event. \n\n## What does Nouns gets by funding this proposal?\n\nBesides being a huge celebration of the Nouns community in Brazil and what we've been building for 9 months after NFT.Rio, and also being a great chance to bring new people on board, Nouns DAO will get:\n\n### Open-air NFT exhibition - [Eletromedia](https://eletromidia.com.br/)\n\nFor 20 days, NFT.Brasil will host the largest open-air NFT exhibition in the world. In partnership with Eletromedia, Brazil's leading Out of Home media company, NFT.Brasil will showcase artists' works  throughout the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, and Fortaleza. \n\nWe want Nouns to be a part of this activation. **Last year at NFT.Rio, the OOH media led the Nouns 367 sale bought by Sanuxo for 113.22 ETH.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HrGlQ5F.jpg)\n\nThe proposed package for this proposal aims 13 days of insertions in strategic points over the city of São Paulo, described as follows:\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/mTmBjNZ/nounify-1.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gtsn3ig.jpg)\n\nSão Paulo is a global city, it's Brazil's highest GDP and the 10th largest in the world with a over 12 million residents. See bellow the distribution of Eletromidia Presence in Sao Paulo\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ydOnnUg.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Nouns Booth\n\n## This would be the new booth position and we are keeping the nounish activations below.\n\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/nR0rS90/nounify.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BlLWPOD.png)\n\n\n### Metaverse (We kept this here cause we are still doing metaverse stuff and what is done will not be undone) \n\nNFT.Brasil is created a metaverse in either Cryptovoxels and Spatial, designed by the talented metarchitect Fabio Ema. During the four-day IRL event, everything will be broadcasted there. After that, the NFT.Brasil team will keep it active for three months with online events, and the community will be able to use it as they see fit, forever. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6cJJdRG.gif)\n\nMake sure to watch the [full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FfSsVZsFZM)!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LQ8o9JA.jpg)\n\n\nWhen we say take over São Paulo, we mean it. After prop 142 lots of relevant unpredictable things happen. In a meeting with Bob Burnquist the **São Paulo MAYOR** got nounified when checking NFT.Brasil Metaverse for the first time using SkateCuida institute VR headset 👇 (not to mention [random TV exposure](https://skatehive.app/hive-173115/@xvlad/rucfdpzf)) \n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/hZksJkY/ezgif-com-crop.gif)\n\n\n### Main Stage\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dRT2vCC.jpg)\n\n\nAubtoshi is an exciting addition to the lineup of main stage speakers at the upcoming NFT.Brasil event. As a highly influential figure in the Nouns community, Aubtoshi's presentation is sure to be a highlight of the event. Her expertise and experience within the Nouns ecosystem will provide valuable insights for attendees, while her engaging speaking style and natural charisma are sure to captivate the audience. \n\nWe'll also have a builders panel with Nouns BR members such as JP, Guiriba, Debussy, Vlad and others. They will tell  their stories within the ecosystem and invite the audience to join the Nouns community.\n\n### NFT.Brasil Exhibition\n\nNFT.Brasil is excited to announce that the upcoming exhibition will feature an exclusive art display by Nouns, alongside other highly respected collections such as Crypto Punks, Doodles and of course innovative navite brazilian collections. As one of the featured collections, Nouns will have a prominent position in the exhibition, offering visitors a chance to explore the ecosystem and engage with Nouns team. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uVh9ccj.png)\n\n**Building community, Every Day, Forever**\n\nThis event is not only a celebration of our achievements so far, but also a unique opportunity to showcase Nouns brand to millions of people across Brazil's largest cities for several weeks. As the biggest NFT event in the country, we have the chance to onboard thousands of new community members and take Nouns community in Brazil to the next level.\n\nNFT.Brasil is going to bring more than 5,000 students from public schools with a unique 3-day opportunity to explore the world of digital art. This event not only offers a chance to appreciate the beauty of this art form but also serves as a platform for driving social impact and fostering community development. Alongside Skate Cuida, G10 Favelas, a group of  social impact leaders and entrepreneurs from the Favelas, plays a vital role in this initiative. \n\n## *\"THE REASON IS THE CAUSE AND THE CAUSE IS TO ADVANCE BRASIL IN FUTURE TECHNOLOGY\"*\n> Bob Burnquist\n\n## Budget Breakout in USDC \n\n### - **NFT.Brasil Sponsorship**\n\n- Sponsorship Package - $ 15.000,00 (-5k negotiated discount for ⌐◨-◨ only ) \n    - 13 passports and 40 expo tickets for 3-day event access (raffled off to the Brazilian community)\n    - Main stage speaker (Aubtoshi)\n    - Brand exposure on social media and website\n    - Brand exposure within the event\n    - 5m² booth space\n    ![](https://i.ibb.co/JBsWxYN/image.png)\n\n\n- Street Galery - $ 20.000,00 \n    - Eletromedia (OOH media in São Paulo)\n    - 13 days, NFT.Brasil will host the largest open-air NFT exhibition in the world\n    - [Over 1 Million ⌐◨-◨ impressions](https://eletromidia.com.br/) .\n    - Big Surprise\n\n\n### - **Nouns Activation**\n\n- Booth Construction and Nounification Costs - $ 1.680,00\n    - 3 days rental\n        - 2 TVS + Stands $ 500,00\n        - BackDrop $ 250,00\n        - Booth mobilia (Balcony, chairs, puff)  $ 580,00\n        - Nouns Decoration (Wall Stickers and Fabric) $ 350,00\n\n\n- Booth activation during the 3-day event - During the three-day event, three members of Nouns BR will be shifting in the booth, being entirely dedicated to onboarding new users.

We recognized the need to start a movement that promotes fun, fitness, and FRENship while showcasing the positive aspects of Nouns.\n\nOur long-term vision includes hosting a major road marathon with Nouns as the title sponsor and host, aiming to create a lasting impact on the industry's perception and proliferation.\n\n## Accomplishments So Far 🏅\n\nSince its inception in April 2023, the Nouns Running Club has made remarkable strides in achieving its goals of promoting physical fitness, community growth, and social responsibility. Here are some of our key accomplishments:\n\n- Grown to over 120 members on Telegram, with more joining every week 📈.\n- Over a thousand cumulative KMs run by members.\n- Established weekly run leaders in 8 different cities around the world (see below), providing members with the opportunity to participate in regular group runs 🌏.\n- Developed a strong brand identity, including a custom t-shirt, a dedicated Telegram chat, and a set of Telegram sticker packs created by [@MochiNFT](https://twitter.com/MochiNFT) on the recommendation of [@0xMaki](https://twitter.com/0xmaki).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ3mJNzSh.png)\n\nThese accomplishments demonstrate the commitment and dedication of the Nouns Running Club. With the support of the wider Nouns DAO community, we aim to continue to grow and make an even greater impact.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk6fJVzBh.png)\n\n## Proliferation 📈\n\nHow does the Nouns Running Club promote proliferation of Nouns and Nounish-ness?\n\nOne of the major hurdles 🚧 to proliferation is the difficulty of introducing Nouns to people outside of crypto. However, we can jump over that hurdle by welcoming anyone, regardless of running ability, promoting the Nounish values of collaboration, diversity, and open participation.\n\nYou don't even need to hold NFTs or know what crypto is. If you can move from point A to B, you're invited! 🏃💨\n\nWearing our custom Nouns Running Club gear, we act as moving billboards, promoting Nouns to onlookers and fellow runners. Our events create opportunities for people to interact with the Nouns community in a fun, informal, and healthy context.\n\nOur goal is to reshape the social layer and showcase the positivity of Nouns to a wider audience.\n\n## Activities 🏃‍♀️\n\nThe Nouns Running Club will engage in two types of activities: Special Event Runs at Crypto Conferences and Local Chapter Weekly Runs. Both are key to our plan for growth and proliferation.\n\nThese are usually ~5km runs targeted towards beginners to run at a leisurely pace. We have a culture of \"No one left behind!\", which means we will always ensure that everyone is taken care of regardless of their pace.\n\nIn fact, it's in our motto:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryEWrNzr2.png)\n\n### Special Event Runs at Crypto Conferences 🎟️\n\nBy doing special runs as a side-event to conferences, we can penetrate a much bigger audience as people from around the world fly in to attend these conferences. This has been proven by our genesis event in ETHGlobal Tokyo, which spawned the Tokyo, Taipei, Hong Kong, and Seoul chapters. See testimonials below!\n\n#### EthCC (Paris 🇫🇷) - July 17, 2023\n\nEthCC is the largest annual Ethereum event in Europe. Not only that, it is also a non-profit event by the local Ethereum community. Very Nounish! Owing to the fact that we do not currently have any local chapters in Europe, we hope this activation will allow us to grow some local chapters in the European region.\n\n#### DevConnect (Istanbul 🇹🇷) - November 13, 2023\n\nSince DevCon has been postponed, this will be the premier Ethereum event of the year. The location of Istanbul will also attract many attendees from all over Europe, and we believe that this will help bootstrap multiple European chapters as well.\n\n### Local Chapter Weekly Runs 🌍\n\nEach local chapter has its own run leaders who organize and guide weekly runs. These leaders serve as ambassadors of Nounish-ness in their respective localities, promoting the values of Nouns DAO and encouraging more people to join the ecosystem.\n\nBy integrating physical fitness with community engagement, we aim to create a unique, fun, and rewarding experience for all members of the community.\n\nCurrently, we have local chapters in the following cities:\n\n- Denver 🇺🇸 led by [@jp4g_](https://twitter.com/jp4g_)\n- Hong Kong 🇭🇰 led by [@Natalielpy](https://twitter.com/Natalielpy)\n- Kuala Lumpur 🇲🇾 led by [@motypes](https://twitter.com/motypes)\n- Santo Domingo 🇩🇴 led by [@necfas](https://twitter.com/necfas)\n- Seoul 🇰🇷 led by [@colorchipeth](https://twitter.com/colorchipeth)\n- Taipei 🇹🇼 led by [@AkiraWuc](https://twitter.com/AkiraWuc)\n- Tokyo 🇯🇵 led by [@shutollen](https://twitter.com/shutollen)\n- Vancouver 🇨🇦 led by [@adrianmcli](https://twitter.com/adrianmcli)\n\nWith the help of this proposal, we hope to expand to at least three more cities within the next 6 months, with a particular focus in the European region.\n\n## Budget 💰\n\nThe following is a rough estimate of the costs required for running the club for the next 6 months. The primary purpose of the funds is to enhance the experience of our club events to attract more newcomers and proliferate Nouns further into the world.\n\n### **1. Special Event Runs at Crypto Conferences**\n\n**1.1 ETHCC (Paris) & 1.2 DevConnect (Istanbul)**\n\n- Customized Local Logo Design: $1,000\n- Dry-Fit Running T-Shirts (30 units at $35 each): $1,050\n- Discretionary Fund: $2,000\n\n**Subtotal for Special Event Runs ($4,050 x 2): $8,100**\n\n### **2. Regular Operations at Local Chapter Weekly Runs**\n\n*(Estimated budget remains consistent across chapters)*\n\n**2.1 to 2.8: Tokyo 🇯🇵, Seoul 🇰🇷, Taipei 🇹🇼, Vancouver 🇨🇦, Hong Kong 🇭🇰, Denver 🇺🇸, Kuala Lumpur 🇲🇾, Santo Domingo 🇩🇴**\n\n- Customized Local Logo Design: $1,000\n- Dry-Fit Running T-Shirts (30 units at $35 each): $1,050\n- Discretionary Fund: $2,000\n\n**Subtotal for Local Chapter Weekly Runs ($4,050 x 8): $32,400**\n\n### **3. Expansion to Three Additional Cities**\n\n- Customized Local Logo Design: $1,000\n- Dry-Fit Running T-Shirts (30 units at $35 each): $1,050\n- Discretionary Fund: $2,000\n\n**Subtotal for Expansion to New Cities ($4,050 x 3): $12,150**\n\n### **4. Breakdown of Discretionary Spending**\n\nEach Discretionary Fund, amounting to $2,000 per city, is intended to enhance the overall running club experience and ensure smooth operations. It can be allocated as follows:\n\n- Promotional Materials (stickers, flyers): $200\n- Additional Swag (e.g., water bottles, towels, headbands): $500\n- Monthly Post-Run Gatherings (estimated $100 per gathering): $600\n- Online Collaborative Tools (Notion Plus, Google Workspace, etc.): $200\n- Contingency Reserve (for unexpected expenses): $500\n\n### **Total Estimated Budget: $52,650**\n\nThe budget proposal accounts for a cost of **approximately $4,050 per city or event for the next 6 months**. This total reflects the Nouns Running Club's extensive and committed network of volunteers in eight different countries, each hosting regular runs and contributing to the vibrant global community.\n\n## Leadership 👑\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyzH-INS3.png)\n\nThe leadership team consists of 8 individuals spread across 8 countries, each running their local Nouns Running Club chapter. One of them is [@adrianmcli](https://twitter.com/adrianmcli), the holder of two Nouns (#261 and #449).

Among them, \"Let's run together and create a healthy crypto culture!💪\" caught my attention due to my passion for exercise, so I immediately signed up. It proved to be a refreshing and much-needed event. Running amidst the beautiful Tokyo scenery, I bonded with fellow crypto industry acquaintances who shared a similar interest in fitness, allowing me to make friends quickly. Additionally, receiving a delightful printed t-shirt added to my happiness. Recognizing that I couldn't continue this running event upon returning to Seoul, I took the initiative to become the lead organizer and gather individuals for running sessions in my city.\"\n\n— [@colorchipeth](https://twitter.com/colorchipeth), Seoul Chapter Leader, Nouns Running Club\n\n> \"In the beginning of my first 5k run with Nouns Running Club, I was nervous because everyone else seemed to be much more experienced in running, but this feeling completely went away as the founder of the club, Adrian, stayed back and kept pace with me all the time. \n> \n> But what made me even more touched is what happened next. As we approached the 4km mark, the rest of the group, who had already completed the run, turned back and rejoined us. We were both very surprised and asked them why they came back. Akira, our Taipei Club leader, replied us with a warm smile, \"Of course we come back, we are a club.\" And another member (Jack, Denver chapter leader) also smiled and said to us \"No one left behind.\" In the end, we finished our 5k together as a united team. \n> \n> Thanks to this experience and the whole group, I started to like running and run with the club whenever I have time. And I hope that more people could experience what I have experienced. This club is not only about running, it's also about togetherness, care, and the pure kindness between people.\"\n\n— Sydney, Taipei Chapter Member, Nouns Running Club\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJ_OgVfHh.png)\n\n## Conclusion 🎯\n\nIn conclusion, the Nouns DAO Running Club represents a unique amalgamation of health, community, and social responsibility. We believe in the transformative power of running and its ability to bring individuals together, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose.\n\nWe aim to challenge stereotypes, promote a healthy lifestyle, and cultivate a strong, vibrant community within the Nouns ecosystem.

Project Goals For Upcoming 6 Months**\n\n### **Why should we fund this extension?**\n\n* We want to assist Nouns community, particularly builders and artists, to be able to contribute their project materials and outputs via the platform, which serves as the primary archive centre for the Nouns ecosystem that can be a good reference to others & later generations.\n* It'd be one of the main onboarding tools that keeps track of everything that has occurred in Nouns DAO.\n* We anticipate that the platform will inspire more builders & artists to produce remarkable & high-quality content.\n* We believe that by developing a good proliferation strategies, complementary features & tools that cater the target audience could bring great values, increase targeted KPIs & enhance the product market fit of this project.\n* We will produce profit-oriented products that generates revenue back to the DAO's treasury.\n\n### **Strategy Summary**\n\n1. **Website Enhancement & Features**\n    * **CC0 media page**\n        * pinterest-like\n        * search & filter by type\n        * downloadable\n    * **Community archive submission**\n        * submit project/content outputs\n        * based on category/entirely new\n        * submission history\n    * **Permanent storage media uploader**\n        * free for nounish builders & Nouns-related NFT holders (token-gated)\n        * upload history\n    * **Archivist/builder leaderboard**\n        * gamification\n    * **Feed**\n        * RSS & Atom XML\n        * JSON (Public API)\n\n2. **Proliferation**\n    * **Publications**\n        * kickstart Nouns Archive '23 (sample physical book)\n        * produce monthly Nouns Zine (digital & physical)\n        * convert to profit oriented product\n        * proceeds goes to DAO\n        * quarterly wrap-up report\n    * **Brand Awareness**\n        * prop house round ; Nouns Archive\n        * new feature updates on social media\n        * daily props curation/highlights\n        * ads & campaign (gamified)\n\n3. **Maintenance & Sustainability**\n    * **General website maintenance**\n        * enhance better ui/ux\n    * **Data curation & updates**\n        * data > filter > curate > present\n        * daily updates\n    * **Incentivise submission through leaderboard**\n        * community submission\n\n### **Strategy Details**\n\n**For Website Enhancement & Features ;**\n\n**1. Community archive submission**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EKvVcFO.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zRGCmYR.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kYzeI8v.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AUrMjNR.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1rQXaEQ.png)\n\n* To build **a curated submission form** attached to the website which allows anyone to contribute to the platform.\n* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) and could request to submit a new sub-category and additional contents to their existing proposals/details.\n* The forms will allow users to select their preferred category, status, type of house, round, etc. *(based on specific usage)*\n* User can check their submission history together with submission details *(eg; date, title & status)*\n\n**2. Permanent storage media uploader**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gVzs6Ih.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IoUQQkb.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KFIzROZ.png)\n\n* To improvise an [uploader](https://uploadr.app/) with some new features which we have built for the past few months.\n* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) & it will be token gated focusing on Nouns ecosystem to use it for free ;\n    * Nounders\n    * Nouners\n    * Nounish Builders\n    * Sub DAOs\n    * Nouns' NFT Open Edition Holders / Droposals *(This Is Nouns, The Wizard's Hat etc)*\n* Anyone who has just got noun-pilled into the ecosystem and want to use it, they may choose from any of the available criteria above. This will gradually benefit the Nouns DAO ecosystem over time.\n* User can check their upload history together with the details *(eg; date, title & arweave link)*\n\n**3. Archivist/Contributor Leaderboard**\n\n* We want to create archivist/contributor leaderboard with gamification where top contributors will be incentivised.\n* We will use the fund under **OpEx** in ***Budget***.\n\n**4. Feed**\n\nUtilising a simplified and condensed data feed can be more efficient than navigating through an entire website for the required information, making data feed crucial for individual use cases. That is why we're adding feed as a new feature, to make it easier for you to access the data you need and achieve your goals more efficiently.\n\nWe will provide a few types of feed for the main & sub-category pages ;\n  * RSS feed - /rss.xml\n  * Atom  feed - /atom.xml\n  * JSON feed - /feed.json\n\nThe data we have gathered can be utilised by everyone in the ecosystem for their own unique purposes. For instance, a mini companion app can directly use the JSON feed to list all proposals in NSFW Small Grants.\n\n**For Proliferation Plan ;**\n\n**1. Publications - Nouns Archive '23**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oDnnmMN.png)\n\n* We will produce a yearly curated physical book that features the archive's contents.\n* It would be a completed & working sample physical book which does not include mass production.\n* The prop house round winner's design will be featured as the book's cover. *(more details below)*\n* We will kickstart the pre-production of the book in June 2023.\n* All builders and artists will be contacted to obtain permission to use their works inside the book *(unless CC0)*\n* Anyone who wishes to contribute can do so as we will communicate the deadline for submitting materials.\n* We will make it available for pre-order/mint. Holders will need to redeem for a physical piece.\n* All **profits** goes to the Nouns DAO's treasury.\n* We are not taking any compensation due to already been funded by the DAO.\n* More infos regarding the launch will be announced.\n\n**2. Nouns Zines**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry1WxY_N3.png)\n\n* We will produce a monthly curated zine that features great contents from Nouns ecosystem.\n* We believe that the focus of the first few issues contents should emphasise on onboarding more people towards Nouns and showing the most notable accomplishment from the first year of Nouns and on-going projects *(eg; Noundry, SuperBowl, Nouns Vision, TSP, Nouns Mural etc)*\n* The prop house round winner's design will be featured as the zine's cover. *(more details below)*\n* We will make it available for pre-order/mint & preview. Holders can also redeem for a physical piece *(the cost of shipping is borne by the holder)*\n* All **profits** goes to the Nouns DAO's treasury.\n* We are not taking any compensation due to already been funded by the DAO.\n* More infos regarding the launch will be announced.\n\n**3. Prop House Round - Nouns Archive**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1zSnoUEn.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJgXjsUN2.png)\n*(Framework flow for each month)*\n\n* We will be producing two type of publications ; Nouns Zine & Nouns Archive '23.\n* We are looking at hosting our own prop house round, Nouns Archive. We will organize a few CC0 contests, with the selected winners being featured on the cover page & contents for Zine 01-05 & Nouns Archive '23.\n* Upon approval, we will start our first prop house round in June 2023.\n* There will be **six rounds** in total, 5 rounds for Nouns Zine & 1 round for Nouns Archive '23.\n* For each round, there will be ;\n    * 3 winners with a prize pool of **0.45E** *(1st/0.2E, 2nd/0.15E & 3rd/0.1E)*\n    * artwork of the **first-place winner** will be minted as open edition & to be featured as the zine cover of that month\n    * artworks of the **second & third-place winner** will be featured in the zine of that month\n    * **60%** of the proceeds goes to the DAO's treasury, **20%** goes to the artist & **20%** goes to Nouns Archive \n    * we will use **20%** of the proceeds to Nouns Archive to enhance the prize pool for future contests / add contest rounds / zine production etc\n    * for each round, it will be 3 weeks of submission period & 1 week of voting period\n    * Nouns ecosystem/holders are eligible to vote for the round. More infos will be announced\n\n**For Maintenance & Sustainability ;**\n\n**1. Data Permanence & Sustainability**\n\n* All compiled datas are stored in [Nouns Archive's notion](https://voadz.notion.site/Nouns-Archive-da52f93301dd4ed59e5b876bd5151d93).\n* We are using **Arweave** network to store all the datas due to its one time fee permanent storage and we want to use it exclusively for all storage going forward.\n* Currently, around **40%** of the datas are now saved on Arweave, with the remaining **60%** being processed. *(Currently on Notion)*\n* There have been a few instances where artists or builders have discontinued their hosting and lost their tracks; this is something we do not want to happen again.\n* We want to make sure all datas of Nouns ecosystem are permanently stored in a decentralised manner and is always accessible.\n* We are able to boost the website's performance with the help of **Vercel Edge Network** which offers image optimization, page load speed & automatically data cached on the network.\n* The cost of uploading will be factor in under **OpEx** as per attached in ***Budget***.\n\n**2.

I propose to fund the development of credit card-sized computers that would be ideal for Ethereum staking.\n\nNounsDAO's commitment to making individual staking fun and popular would be a net plus for the whole network and ecosystem's well-being.\n\nIn my opinion, focusing on the public good would increase the recognition and respect for NounsDAO, which is the best strategy for proliferation.\n\n## Description\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk8iWv2H3.gif)\n\nA lot of good single-board computers are available on the market, and the competition is stiff. However, the purpose of Noun Computers is not to dominate the market or make good profits. It is about a mission to do public good and unite like-minded developers, which will propel the nounish culture and memes. Of course, the key to success is a sustainable model. I believe Noun Computers will be successful because NounsDAO has an amazing culture, a better understanding of community, and connections in the blockchain circles. \n\nI propose the development of Noun Computers, which would run Linux operating system. These computers would be designed specifically for convenient Ethereum stacking, blockchain development, and practical programming learning. By doing so, we can establish a vibrant community of software and hardware developers who will eventually become good supporters and contributors to NounsDAO.\n\nJust imagine, the next thousand ethereum stakers (potential nouners) are mingling somewhere at blockchain conferences at this very moment! A cool gadget like Noun Computer would make for a great conversation starter. It has the potential to attract the attention of numerous high-profile individuals. We will be able to onboard many people to buy our Noun Computers and run Ethereum nodes.\n\n## Noun Computers\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1k5pljSn.png)\n\nNoun Computers will provide affordability, versatility, and the best price/performance/user experience within its category. I will design the Noun Computers from scratch. I majored in electrical engineering and computer science and have experience developing similar computer boards. Noun computers will be perfectly suited for running Ethereum nodes, software/hardware hacking, and teaching programming. \n\nOnce the project is completed, I will deliver PCB designs, blueprints, bill of materials, and estimated costs for mass production. In the future, NounsDAO will have the ability to order large batches of computers at wholesale prices. Additionally, we can develop expansion modules, interesting interfaces, and manufacture nounish cases to further enhance the product line.\n\nIn this project, I will focus on developing state of the art prototypes and estimating manufacturing cost. The limited supply of 50 prototypes will be used to create visibility and promote NounsDAO at conferences.\n\n- A Noun Computer equipped with a 1.5GHz CPU, 8GB RAM, and a 2TB M.2 SSD for running an Ethereum node will cost around $80 to $110.\n- A light version of Noun Computer with less memory can cost as low as $50\n- If there is significant demand and Noun Computers are produced in large quantities (3,000-5,000 units), the manufacturing cost can be further lowered, making Noun Computers a sustainable model for proliferation. The proceeds from sales could then be utilized to manufacture more computers and introduce additional accessories.\n\n## Deliverables\n- Design blueprints, schematics, and a plan for mass production of Noun Computers\n- 50 units of Noun Computer prototypes with aluminum head-crt-bsod case\n    - 10 units - distributed to Nouns' auction winners (starting with the first auction on the opening day of ETH Global NY or Istanbul)\n    - 10 units - showcase and distribute at conferences\n    - 30 units - organize ETH Global Hackathon competition centered around Noun Computers\n\n## Timeline\n**Phase I - Prototyping (4~6 months)**\n- [Jun~Aug 2023] Design and Manufacture Noun-Computer prototypes\n- [Sep or Nov 2023] Bring Noun Computers to ETH Global hackathon and organize hacking competition\n\n## Outsourcing companies\nI have many years of experience working with two great companies KS Technology and Hansaem digitec.\n- KS Technology https://altium.kr/\n- Hansaem digitec https://www.hsdgt.com/main/main.html\n\n## Future opportunities\n- **[Proliferation]** We can **sponsor ETH hackathons** and supply Noun Computers for hardware hackathons. Expansion modules such as camera, NFC, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, and others would open doors for new, fun, and practical blockchain applications. In the long term, we can grow a community of developers around Noun Computers.\n- **[Onboarding]** We can manufacture Noun Computers in large quantities and offer them at affordable prices. By doing so, we could **onboard the Ethereum community** and encourage their contribution to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by **running Ethereum nodes**.\n- **[Public Good]** We can **allocate 20%~30%** of the future supply of Noun Computers to NounsDAO Public Good Fund. Nouners will be able to request computers via an on-chain proposal and send them to **developing countries and minority groups**. Noun Computers can be used to teach practical programming at schools and universities. It is a good way to put resources into the hands of people.\n\n## Person In Charge\nTwitter: [fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)\nHey!

For Nouns projects, products and beyond. \nRequesting 18 eth. \n\n### See the draft letter drawings in use: [nounsfonts.wtf](https://nounsfonts.wtf)\n\n## WHY\nOn websites, videos, gear, and other items, the display typeface a user sees is one of the most critical aspects of visual recognition. \n    \nA display typeface performs numerous functions like an oft-needed guide for a weary traveler. It reassures users, gives them a good feeling, creates understanding, and establishes direction. Of all the typefaces used in Nouns materials–outside of Nountown–none feel particularly Nounish. This is because there aren’t any genuinely Nounish display fonts available for use. We aim to solve that–Nouners need more tools for their evergrowing toolbox to help spread the lore of Nouns.\n    \nThe [Nountown](https://nouns.center/assets) typeface is inspiring. Picking up where Gremplin left off, I propose creating a unique, beautiful, functional Nounish display typeface with a CC0 license available for general use. We use CC0, so this font can be a starting point for a whole suite of open-source Nounish fonts, bolstering the ecosystem visually. **Nouns Display is a font L1 that many L2s can be built on. Eg., Nouns Display and lil nouns display.**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1_CqbhBn.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1Xaobnr2.png)\n   \nThanks to the generous support of our [prop house proposal](https://prop.house/proposal/5071) we have a start. The initial sketches, and process can be seen on our microsite [nounsfonts.wtf ](https://nounsfonts.wtf)\n\nThis proposal allows us to finish a full-featured CCO typeface that everyone can use on nouns projects, products, and beyond.\n\n    \n## GETTING IT OUT THERE\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJCC9AsH3.jpg)\n\nWe will produce a limited run of distinctly tasteful gear featuring the typeface upon launch.\n\nWe will submit Nouns Display for inclusion in the Google Fonts catalogue for wide distribution and easy use in Figma. \n    \nIt will be used on [Zora’s new profiles pages](https://zora.co/profiles). \n    \nWe will structure a Zora-based NFT launch when the typeface is complete. **Nouns Display would be the first NFT of a usable production typeface, effectively disrupting the typeface industry with NFTs and opening up a new paradigm for fonts as financial assets.**\n\n\n## WHO\nI am Marco Braunschweiler, a designer with a background in art, and I make typefaces that I use everyday. I’ve worked with Tribute Labs, The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, Acura, Sonos, The New York Times, and NTS Radio.\n\nMy fonts are here: [m-a-r-c-o.com/typefaces](https://m-a-r-c-o.com/typefaces)\nMy design studio is here: [openwindow.studio](https://openwindow.studio)\n\n\n## ROADMAP\nPhase 1 is complete. This proposal is for phases 2, and 3. Requesting 18 ETH.\n\n**Phase One – Complete**\n*Initial Sketches of Uppercase Letterforms*\nWe want to make sure we’re getting it right and creating something everyone loves; in this phase, we’ve done the research and made sketches for the initial letters, uppercase A–Z. Results are viewable at [nounsfonts.wtf](https://nounsfonts.wtf).\n\n\n**Phase Two – Up Next**\n*Drawing all Latin Glyphs*\nNow that research is done and a direction is established, we draw all the uppercase and lowercase Latin glyphs. At the end of this phase, we will have drawings of all the characters used. We will work with Nounish designers to test the typeface and collect feedback.\n\n    \n**Phase Three – Finish Line**\n*Updates, Revision, Mastering*\nThe finish line. We work to refine the typeface and master it for use across platforms. At the end of this phase, we have the final files that anyone can use to make their projects, and the world, look a bit more Nounish.\n\n    \n**Spec Sheet**\nFinal typeface will be ready for wide-use, and will include the following:\n* CC0 License\n* Mastering\n* Hinting\n* Unicode data normalization\n* Opentype feature checks\n* Metrics normalization/optimisation for desktop, mobile, and web environments\n* Generating final desktop and webfont files in: OTF, TTF, WOFF, WOFF2\n* Submission to Google Fonts \n        \n\n### Thank you for reading, and for your consideration."},{"blockNumber":17365340,"blockHash":"0xe60e115e7af6678f5346c643496cb034424dcdfa34d3192038bfcb011a0d6114","transactionIndex":126,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x932d4d712c4286c5010cecf6a05a1636167c8f93d1097f68f81f70a8971a65fd","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":300,"proposer":"0x8AE80e0B44205904bE18869240c2eC62D2342785","targets":["0x8AE80e0B44205904bE18869240c2eC62D2342785"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":17401340,"endBlock":17437340,"description":"# Nouns Mirai JAPAN\n\n# Nouns Mirai Japan　\n![筆文字](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1nnHaQKTWGm_xTs2jWD492vNsQ6jf80Nw)\n\nTitle of this exhibition We created a title logo that utilizes Japanese tradition and brush strokes.\nIt represents this event in a lighthearted manner, evoking the image of tradition and newness/future.\n\n  # Over view\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNouns Mirai Japan is an activity in which we, pNounsDAO, will hold simultaneous events at WebX, Web3 Conference Asia, and our own metaverse space at the Tokyo International Forum in July, to share with event participants a new future where Nouns has penetrated society.\n\n![黒いマーク](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1DK4LaofXgqi6IGmH7qkWwrLqzg2mSDoY&usp)\n\n\n\n\n**Event Logo Mark\nNoggles(Nouns)✖️Web3(WebX)✖️Simple image of the fusion of Japan (Hinomaru)**\n\n\n---\n# TL;DR\n・A comprehensive event for Metaverse and IRL to dramatically increase the visibility of Nouns.\n\n・A festival of people and art that depicts a future society in which Nouns have permeated Japan.\n\n・IRL will exhibit a Japanese booth at Web X, a global Web3 conference.\n\n・In Metaverse, we will recreate Japanese side streets and summer festivals, and will decorate the events with live music.\n\n\n## Challenges in Web3\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPeople involved in Web3 have a common challenge.\nThat is that there are still so many people in the world who have never heard of or touched web3.\n\nIn the Web2 world, Facebook has over 3 billion people worldwide,\nYoutube and WhatsApp have over 2 billion, WeChat and Tik Tok have over 1 billion users.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of virtual currency and web3 users worldwide is 320 million worldwide, which is only about 4.2% of the world's population.\n\nIn Japan, the number of crypto asset holders is said to be 11%, and the number of NFT buyers in Japan is 20,000. It can be said that Web3 has not yet penetrated the general public. Naturally, even fewer people know about nouns.\n\nHowever, due to the growth of the blockchain field and the fact that nouns and Noggles are IPs using CC0We imagine that nouns and Noggles will gradually penetrate the market and become a commonplace part of society in the future.\nThis is the timeline we are aiming for and realizing, we believe that participating in the Web3 Conference is very meaningful.\n\n\n## Concept\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**“ Mirai ” means Future.**\n\n\n〜The future of nouns and noggles in Japan.  \n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　A place to showcase such a future, one step ahead〜\n\n\n![田川さんのコンセプトアート](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=17MZIZqPcUGiz_xfOsM7sJg34HF0VqjsG)\n\n**Key visual　”Pop Pop Tokyo”**\n\n\n*PROLOGUE*\n*Nounsdao is a new organization called dao, built by web3 technology, with the philosophy of making the world more enjoyable through character and art.*\n\n*The activities of dao are helping to integrate nouns among people around the world and create the beloved Mirai.

We will introduce the future of the fusion of nouns and Japan to visitors using the spirit of harmony (exhibition), art (live painting), and metaverse (technology).\n\n\n## Key Points\n\nNouns characters and Noggles will blend naturally with Tatami mats and Japanese culture, showing the futuristic fun of mixed culture.\n\nWe will set up a unique and different Japanese-style room in the business conference space to provide visitors with the experience of taking off their shoes and sitting on tatami mats.\n\nIn the Tatami room, noggle type VR glasses will be provided.

Such a uniquely Japanese interior is expressed in a small space of 3m✖️3m.\n\nVisitors pass through the noren (curtain) and are invited to enter a small but isolated Japanese space with tatami mats. In this small space, we commissioned a master craftsman and a noren workshop to create a small Japanese room that can be incorporated into modern life, creating an interior that makes the most of the small space.\n\n\n\n## Live Painting -Drawing Mirai on a pure white campus\n---\n\n\n![田川さんの制作写真](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1RbpKX_psTCrz5T4Qy-_B3-SolAl5fpIV)\n\n\n[🔗Live painting activity video by Mr. Tagawa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU1USuJtVLU) \n\n\n\nAt the booth, a live painting event will be held, where Makoto Tagawa, a painter, will create a key visual of NounsMiraiJAPAN from scratch on a pure white wall of 2.7m✖️3.0m.

We garnered [record support from the DAO](https://lilnouns.proplot.wtf/idea/529), as well as valuable feedback from many members that helped improve our prop. We look forward to supporting the Lils and being part of the community!_\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## TL;DR:\n\n* We are proposing to use our Matr Labs robotics to fabricate 1,001 Nouns on-demand from #0 to #1,000. Artmatr will develop custom software and hardware to pull off this feat, including an exclusive airdropped physical redemption token, MATRing portal with algorithmic and AI creative control, cutting edge tool development, and the extensive code development required to tie it all together. All Noun holders will have the right to customize and claim their respective physical copy(s).  \n* All shipping and handling costs to deliver the physical work to community members will be covered by Artmatr. We will create or employ a shipping system that ensures anonymity of any address information needed.\n* Complementary digital content, including timelapse videos and high-resolution photography, will be available to Nouns holders and the community, and the airdropped redemption tokens will update to display the MATRed Nouns upon completion.\n* We will produce a massive Nouniversary event at Artmatr’s gallery, showcasing some of the first MATRed Nouns with live MATRing throughout the day.\n* This project will add a significant amount of new value to existing Nouns mints, as well as upcoming auctions. The content created by each Noun’s MATRing process will be widely distributed and shared, elevating visibility of the innovative ways Nouns can be works of art IRL, and the Nouniversary will be an opportunity to showcase that! We will also allocate any secondary royalties of the Matr Labs x Nouns token to the Nouns treasury.\n[![UIUX-GIF-1.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/SRSqsxjZ/UIUX-GIF-1.gif)](https://postimg.cc/62mFbwrR)\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## Overview\n\nOur [last prop](https://nouns.wtf/vote/224) allowed Artmatr the opportunity to develop and create seven unique paintings of Nouns over the course of one week in March. Each day’s minted Noun was interpreted by our team of artists and engineers and “MATRed” on the same day as a 48” x 48” oil painting with our custom robotic hardware and code. The winner of each auction was given the rights to the corresponding painting. We celebrated the week of Nouns art with a successful public exhibition and VIP opening in our Brooklyn gallery, attended by major artists, gallerists, and auctioneers from the New York art scene.\n\nWe’re excited to follow up on the success of Prop 224 with a massive endeavor to bring physical art to every Nouner in the world. With the help of the Nouns community’s creative input, we propose to MATR 1,001 Nouns and distribute them globally to their respective holders. [Each Noun-holding wallet will be airdropped a Matr Labs token that can be redeemed for a physical. ](https://vimeo.com/830696167)We will update the metadata of the token upon redemption with a hi-res image of the Matr’d Noun, which will provide a digital Certificate of Authenticity for each physical piece of art. Supporting this huge development and production effort, we will deploy curated content across a variety of social channels, raising visibility of Nouns DAO and the ways Nouns create value and delight for the both broader Web3 community as well as the community of artists and art collectors that we are fostering.\n\nThis project aims to return on investment to the Nouns DAO in as many ways as possible, through high-quality content, marketing, and sponsorship visibility. We will publicly celebrate this endeavor with a huge launch party and exhibition near the August 8th Nouniversary and we will continue to promote this effort through dedicated social channels throughout the rest of the year and into 2024. We also propose that one of our cutting-edge MATR Labs machine racks gets built with custom Nouns sponsorship visibility, so that Noggles and Nouns branding can be seen in the content generated by every piece of art created on the machine. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## Recap\n[![image6.png](https://i.postimg.cc/B6wL4HwZ/image6.png)](https://postimg.cc/njBc1jJN)\n\nProp 224 passed on February 13, 2023, to a resounding yes vote of 151 to 17. We immediately began developing ways we could use our custom robots and software to create a unique oil painting for each Noun over the prescribed week. We developed a number of stylistic directions that required new tools and hours of code development. Ultimately, we created paintings with unique robotically-created textures in the oil paint that brought dimensionality and life to Nouns, and embedded the mint hash into the paintings as well.\n\n[![image9.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/NF9yMFW6/image9.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/4HG42f4y)\n\nWe wrote thousands of lines of code to reinterpret the digital images as paintings, honed the tooling, mixed the paint, and arranged the cameras. As proposed, we completed a unique painting of that day’s Noun, on time, and live streamed the entire process, as well as a 3D scan of each finished work for our virtual gallery. The project pushed our technical limits to the edge and allowed us to try new creative techniques that have greatly improved our art-making processes as a whole.\n\n[![image17.png](https://i.postimg.cc/q71gx2rc/image17.png)](https://postimg.cc/Nyrgg95L)\n\nDuring production time our Twitter and Instagram feeds were full of Nouns as our content and marketing team came up with new and creative ways to showcase the community through the paintings. The project generated great buzz from the community, and generated auction prices above the previous 30-day average, including a 36.69 ETH sale on the genesis painting. The week was capped off with a successful [first-ever exhibition in the Artmatr space in Brooklyn](https://vimeo.com/829178232). The works have been seen and talked about by major collectors, artists, galleries and auction houses, including Christie’s, Pace, Pioneer Works, and many other VIP’s in the crypto and traditional art communities. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n[![image3.png](https://i.postimg.cc/mrBFwbH4/image3.png)](https://postimg.cc/87X5kg4X)\n[![image11.png](https://i.postimg.cc/QtPtRsHH/image11.png)](https://postimg.cc/TLVfDzj6)\n[![image18.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wMmvzPmF/image18.png)](https://postimg.cc/RJv9QgGn)\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nSince the passing and success of our last Prop, Artmatr has grown significantly. We’ve scaled up, adding seasoned Project, Operations, and Product Managers, as well as building a dedicated 3 person marketing team. Our engineering team has also expanded, driving our hardware and software development at breakneck speeds. We held an exhibition opening with Zancan at our Brooklyn gallery space that 500 people attended, and other art from the Artmatr lab has been shown at Pace Gallery and Unit London, among other established galleries worldwide. Our Twitter following has more than doubled, and we engage with a diverse and growing audience across our popular Tik Tok, Instagram, Twitch, and Discord channels. Our organic reach has been very strong, maintaining an impressive 10.5% average engagement rate, with over 400k impressions in the period following the original Prop.\n\nWe learned specific lessons from the execution of our first proposal. The most important thing is that we want to prioritize total community engagement, both the whole Nouns community and our growing Web3-curious traditional art world community. By scaling down the final pieces and allowing anyone to MATR a Noun using a redemption token, we think this project will have a much broader impact. We also want to stress the effort that we plan to put into this project to raise visibility of the Nouns DAO through our social channels. We see each MATRed piece as an opportunity to spread the word about the creativity of the community and promote the brand, and our automated cameras will capture and produce a timelapse video of the MATRing process of each created work. We will also explore collaborative Nouns MATRing with our community of blue-chip artists.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## New Prop\n[![Untitled.png](https://i.postimg.cc/2SDp85Jn/Untitled.png)](https://postimg.cc/nC0S3nnL)\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nOur new Matr Labs platform consisting of newly developed art-making software and scaled down versions of our large machines will incorporate technology distilled from our experiences with the likes of Tyler Hobbs, Zancan and other brilliant artists we work with. The technology is entering a production-ready state from an initial prototype, and we want the Nouns community to work with us as we continue to develop and scale. We are committed to pushing the envelope of technological creativity, and with the assistance of Nouns DAO, we will help define the bridge between digital and physical artwork for a future generation of artists. \n\n[![image16.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Z0zq5cPm/image16.png)](https://postimg.cc/D45hC1Yp)\n\nWe would like to propose that every Noun holder from #0 to #1000 will have the opportunity to use our new platform and generate a unique 18” x 18” unique physical rendition of a Noun (their own, another from the collection, or a new noun from the Playground). Each MATRed Noun will be shipped to the holder at no additional cost, worldwide. \n\n[![image12.png](https://i.postimg.cc/MHCnjxSh/image12.png)](https://postimg.cc/ctcxVp6m)\n\n_User flow: User starts by connecting their wallet & choosing their Noun on the server > Personalizes the Noun > server generated a preview with the translation layer > users has three choices: Modify the artwork, Save the preview for consideration or send to MATR > during the MATRing process, the work is captured in high res and when the MATR process is finished, the work is minted and shipped._\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThe key to MATRing a physical Noun will be the 1,0001 redemption tokens, which will be airdropped to all wallets holding Nouns and will continue to be distributed as new Nouns are minted and won - up to #1,000. In the spirit of Noun’s CC0 license, a redemption token holder will be able to use any Noun in the collection as inspiration for their physical. The tokens can also be traded in the event that a holder does not want a physical, and royalties will be sent to the treasury.\n\n[![](https://i.postimg.cc/PxwJnx90/Group-10.png)](https://vimeo.com/830696167)\n\nThe physical pieces created by the Nouns community and anyone outside who acquires a redemption token will generate increased visibility and value to the DAO, as existing holders and new auction winners alike will be given the opportunity to create a physical representation of their Noun with their own creative input. This creates both physical permanence for the Nouns in the world, as well as the possibility for virality for every related social media post that is shared. Additionally, we will also brand our newly-produced robot with Nouns branding, elevating Nouns visibility alongside the growth of this initiative. This machine will get heavy use, with time lapses and photos being core to the creation process, so the Nouns will be visually associated with the works created by incredible artists using the same tech.\n\n[![image4.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qvdtJkQK/image4.png)](https://postimg.cc/VdDs4Pxs)\n*_Concept of Nouns Sponsored Matr Labs Rack_*\n\nHaving the Nouns community with us will give us the freedom to come up with exciting new ways to implement our technology that we may not otherwise have been able to do when operating within the constraints of an individual artist. We want to continue pushing the boundaries of our technology in order to make art that excites both the Nouns community and our community at-large.\n[![image13.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/k4DG1DM0/image13.gif)](https://postimg.cc/mzfThLHj)\nWe are eager to develop and employ our new tech at the epic scale that it was built for. We went big with this project, and want the community to feel that their money is well spent. It is easy to quantify the project on a per-print cost basis, but do keep in mind that we are also committing to a constant stream of content, marketing, and PR on behalf of the Nouns DAO, an epic NYC event as part of the Nouniversary celebrations, and development of a new Matr Labs robot that will be Nouns sponsored and branded. We feel that these intangibles will bring a lot of value and visibility to the community, while allowing us the opportunity to build the tech to its full potential in a shortened period of  time. \n[![image10.png](https://i.postimg.cc/GmJ49ZS5/image10.png)](https://postimg.cc/MnH6Frw7)\n[![image14.png](https://i.postimg.cc/T2pt8XkG/image14.png)](https://postimg.cc/rz21W7XY)\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n## Timeline & Milestones\n\n* Immediately following the acceptance of the proposal, Artmatr will begin development of a custom Nouns DAO creative interface and the construction of a Nouns-sponsored Matr Labs rack. We will open up private social channels on Discord and provide regular updates on the progress made on both the hardware and software development. We will stay active in those channels for enthusiasts of the technology to engage with our team of artists and engineers and also promote the project development publicly via our Twitter & Instagram. \n* Artmatr will use the community Nouns as our test materials during the summer development process, and will publish the results as the works are formed.\n* Near the public launch of the Matr portal, we will airdrop Matr Labs x Nouns redemption tokens to all wallets holding Nouns. We will continue to distribute those tokens to new holders up to #1,000.\n* We will officially launch the token-gated Nouns website for the community to start generating works using the Nouns on August 1. Shortly thereafter, we will host a live gallery event at Artmatr in NYC near the August 8th Nouniversary. We will exhibit the community Nouns created by Artmatr at the event, and allow Nouns holders the ability to create their work live that day.\n* The community-exclusive MATRing will remain active until January 31, allowing the community to create unique works of art from the Nouns that they hold in their wallets, utilizing a specialized UI which includes a number of AI and algorithmic features. Noun holders will be able to customize their Noun to create a unique work of art using pens, brushes, and our proprietary painting tools, MATRed on acid-free, archival grade 100 lb Bristol cardstock. The works will be shipped to each community member as they are made free of charge.\n* Timelapse video and hi-rez photos of each work will be collected and collated by our automated systems, and will be used to generate additional visibility of the project via dedicated Twitter and Discord channels. The content will also be available on our website, and used to update the metadata of the redemption tokens, transforming the airdrop into a new collection of MATRed Nouns.\n* We commit to doing everything we can to ensure the anonymity of the Nouns DAO community. We are closely aligned with a number of other cryptoart companies who have been working to address this issue (Artfora, for example) and we are working with them on solutions. We are exploring address escrow services, secure databases that automatically delete information after use, and other methods. We want to work with the community in a variety of ways to ensure as many people have access to physical prints as possible and would post instructions on how to address a package to a UPS store or PO Box for additional anonymization.\n\n[![image8.png](https://i.postimg.cc/63Q2kYc1/image8.png)](https://postimg.cc/HJfk50fQ)\n\n[![table2.png](https://i.postimg.cc/zfMYNk1G/table2.png)](https://postimg.cc/bGQBHkJ7)\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## About\n\nArtmatr’s team of experts from the art, robotics, Web3, and marketing worlds are focused on broadly expanding every artists’ creative toolkit. We want to make our highly sophisticated hardware and software technologies available to everyone, from the biggest names in art to an emerging creative at home. We have so far demonstrated our ability to execute bespoke projects at a small scale, and now we are ready to start opening the doors to the world at-large. \n\nLed by CEO Rafael Feitelberg and CCO Ben Tritt, Artmatr’s creative studio in Brooklyn and R&D lab in Israel are developing revolutionary art-making tools and techniques. Our Brooklyn studio has a steady stream of artists coming in with brand new creative ideas unlocked thanks to our expanding technology. This tech platform is a significant part of our future development pipeline with the artists, platforms and galleries that we are working with. We also are developing ways for the public to access this tech and “Matr” their own custom creations. We have plans to scale this product to democratize the creation of physical artwork. In the medium term, it will allow us to have a sustainable solution for artists to work on ideas that may be higher volume and more accessible to a larger collector base. Having Nouns DAO as our development sponsor will accelerate our timeline and product viability for artists to start using it. We think this will be one of our marquee tools, and Nouns will cement themselves in the art community with the legacy and visibility of being the first to use it.\n\nSince our launch mid-2022, we have had successful projects with Tyler Hobbs, Zancan, Matthew Stone and Matthew Day Jackson, and our 2023 pipeline is full of exciting projects with blue-chip and emerging artists alike.\n\nArtmatr’s Investors & Strategic Partners:\n\n\n* [Delphi Digital](https://delphidigital.io): Delphi Digital is the leading research organization for crypto assets.

A collaborative design between Spohn Ranch Skateparks and Keen Ramps for a new, all-concrete park is ready to be built and now just needs the funding to complete the build. The area surrounding the skatepark is predominantly low-income, with many at-risk youths with few recreational opportunities. Together with the local Action Sports Kids (ASK) Foundation, we will unlock the potential of Silverado Skatepark to create a space that will benefit Long Beach area skaters, youth and community members for generations to come.\n\n\n### [THE SKATEPARK PROJECT](https://skatepark.org/)\nThe Skatepark Project (TSP) builds more than skateparks. We build confidence. We build perseverance. We build community. \n\nFounded by Tony Hawk in 2002, TSP is a nonprofit organization working to increase access to outdoor recreation and free play in underserved communities through the creation of safe and inclusive skateparks. To date, TSP has helped build nearly 700 skateparks in underserved communities across the United States serving nearly 9 million skaters each year.\n\n\n### ACTION SPORTS KIDS (ASK) FOUNDATION\nFounded by former Long Beach City Councilman Mike Donelon and a group of skaters in 1996, Action Sports Kids (ASK) Foundation is a nonprofit in Long Beach, California, dedicated to providing youth an alternative to the streets and gangs through sports, education and community involvement. Their efforts to keep their team members in school, out of gangs, off the streets and involved in their community through skateboarding has been recognized by the Long Beach Unified School District and the City of Long Beach.\n\nASK is responsible for all 10 Long Beach skateparks. Their skate team has more than 175 members, ages 3-25, comprised of diverse genders and ethnicities, and applications continue to come in every day. \n\n### PROJECT OVERVIEW\nThe effort to reimagine the Silverado Skatepark began in April 2021 with the encouragement of local skaters. The 5,000-square-foot skatepark was built on an old basketball court located on the west side of Long Beach, California. Separated by the Los Angeles River from the rest of the city, it is the only skatepark in underserved West Long Beach. The elements in the park were relocated from the Michael K. Green and Bixby (Cherry) Skateparks after their respective refurbishment. Dew Tour also donated some in 2018. The park has undergone many repairs over the years. With the exception of a few elements, most are unrepairable and render the park useless due to excessive use.\n\nThe skatepark project has been approved by the office of City of Long Beach Councilmember Roberto Uranga and the City of Long Beach Department of Parks, Recreation and Marine. On September 16, 2021, the City issued a two-year right of access to build the skatepark.\n\n![Skatepark Pic](https://i.imgur.com/Or8RX6g.png)\n![Skatepark Pic2](https://i.imgur.com/uVjAGeg.png)\n*“Our mission at ASK is to empower youth through sports, education, and community. This skatepark is in an underserved area and was heavily used. Rebuilding it will bring back a beloved activity and after-school alternative for at-risk youth.”* - Mike Donelon, founder and executive director of ASK\n\n\n\n### FUNDING OPPORTUNITY\nThis proposal requests a total of ~87 ETH upfront from the DAO for the entire project. See attached cost breakdown.\n\n![Skate Park Reno](https://i.imgur.com/jgimcz9.png)\n***Sample Mockup, exact art not shown.** Detailed Nouns Artwork (Noun Characters, Noggles, ect) will be illustrated on various fixtures throughout the park.*\n\n### TIMELINE\nThe project is expected to take a maximum of four weeks to complete. The exact start date depends on the builders’ schedule, but ASK anticipates beginning the construction during summer 2023. Please note the schedule can only be finalized once funding is secured.\n\n\n**Nouns Artwork** — The Nouns artwork and noggles rail have been viewed and approved by the Long Beach Parks and Recreation Commission. Keen Ramps has recommended working with Van Eggers (@van_eggers), a talented illustrator working out of Long Beach. He has done work for clients such as Foundation Skateboards, Girl Skateboards and Deathwish Skateboards. Oni Apenoun will be coordinating with ASK and Van Eggers to provide assets and assist in creative direction.\n\n**Noggles Rail** — Keen Ramps will manage building, powder coating and installing the signature Noggles Rail.\n\nUpon approval of funding, Spohn Ranch will carry out the project according to the original design, excluding the Nouns rail and artwork. Subsequently, they will handle the installation of the noogles rail and the painting of the artwork.\n\n### TSP PARTNERSHIP PROMOTION\nTSP will promote the partnership and funding support through dedicated social media posts on TSP's platforms. Additionally, TSP will include relevant tags and mentions in social media posts related to the skatepark project, extending its reach and generating a significant impact.\n\n### NOUNS X ASK LONG BEACH PARTNERSHIP HISTORY\n**October 2022** — Nouns DAO partnered with ASK Long Beach and TSP to give away skateboards to local youth at their team meeting/jams at Houghton Skatepark. The boards were funded and designed by Nouns DAO and built by TSP staff and volunteers.\n\n![Skatepark Kids Pic](https://i.imgur.com/0MftGcz.png)\n\n**January  2023** —  ASK Long Beach skateboarders showed their stuff aboard the “Meet the Nouns” float in the 134th annual Rose Parade in Pasadena, California.

At its peak, [block censorship reached ~80%](https://www.mevwatch.info/).\n\nIn response to the public concern, the Flashbots team accelerated [open sourcing their relay code](https://writings.flashbots.net/Flashbots-Relay-open-sourcing) and many teams sprinted towards building non-censoring relay alternatives.\n\nTwo such relays succeeded in gaining meaningful traction—the [ultra sound relay](https://relay.ultrasound.money/) and the [Agnostic relay](https://www.gnosis.io/blog/agnostic-relay-a-credibly-neutral-tool) by the Gnosis team—resulting in the dramatic reduction of censored blocks earlier this year.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJo0cF7I2.png)\n(screenshot from [mevboost.pics](https://mevboost.pics/))\n\nIt's worth noting that such gains in relay market share was not attained simply by launching a copy-paste non-censoring fork of the Flashbots relay. The ultra sound relay team had to actually build a lower latency relay through innovations of their own such as [optimistic](https://github.com/michaelneuder/optimistic-relay-documentation/blob/main/proposal.md) [relaying](https://github.com/ultrasoundmoney/mev-boost-relay/blob/prod-optimistic-relaying/docs/optimistic/an-optimistic-weekend.md) and various devops optimizations.\n\nultra sound relay's market share has been capped around 33% lately because the team is committed to self-cap its dominance to 1/3 of Ethereum blocks to foster relay diversity. They are also working closely with [Mike Neuder](https://twitter.com/mikeneuder) from the EF to help accelerate R&D for [enshrined PBS](https://ethresear.ch/t/why-enshrine-proposer-builder-separation-a-viable-path-to-epbs/15710) that would eliminate the need for relays entirely.\n\n---\n\n## Why should Nouns fund the ultra sound relay?\n\n**1. To continue to express our alignment with Ethereum and its values.**\n\nNouns is a [headless brand](https://otherinter.net/research/headless-brands/). There is no PR head that builds coherent brand identities. Instead, we are what we do.\n\nSo far our track record is strong:\n* We've always held our treasury entirely in ETH or stETH.\n* We've always focused on decentralization and onchain governance.\n* We've always insisted on open sourcing wherever possible, including our own brand IP.\n* We've always cared deeply about public goods.\n\nIt's important to continue these things. To have an identity. To be who we are.\n\nEthereum-aligned public goods we've funded so far in our history:\n* [Prop 21](https://nouns.wtf/vote/21) — donating 169 ETH to Gitcoin grants.\n* [Prop 108](https://nouns.wtf/vote/108) — donating 500 ETH to Ethereum protocol development via the Protocol Guild.\n* [Prop 184](https://nouns.wtf/vote/184) — donating 100 ETH to ZachXBT.\n* [Prop 249](https://nouns.wtf/vote/249) — giving out 30 ETH to Ethereum solo stakers.\n* [Prop 278](https://nouns.wtf/vote/278) — donating 55 ETH to the Gitcoin crypto advocacy round.\n\nWe should be proud of what we've done so far but we must continue. Ethereum-aligned public goods are the substrates of our onchain world and funding them is an important expression of who we are and what we stand for.\n\n**2. To reach prospective DAO members that also care about Ethereum and the onchain world.**\n\nCharismatic giving towards public goods creates [news](https://www.theblock.co/post/193256/nouns-dao-donates-to-zachxbt) and generates [viral attention](https://twitter.com/noun40__/status/1598084457596325888) like anything else we might fund in an attempt to proliferate our brand and attract the attention of prospective DAO members.\n\nFunding Ethereum public goods is particularly useful in this regard since ETH holders and onchain world enthusiasts who care about Ethereum public goods are also (at least currently) our primary prospective DAO member demographic.\n\n---\n\n# Other details\n\n**Who is on the ultra sound relay team?**\n[AlphaMonad](https://twitter.com/AlphaMonad) leads the dev effort, with support from [alex](https://twitter.com/alextes) and [Justin Drake](https://twitter.com/drakefjustin).\n\n**Does the ultra sound money team need the funding?**\nThis proposal is meant to recognize what has been accomplished (more like an award) not necessarily fund future work so the proposal does not focus on this aspect. However, the team communicated that funding is currently very tight, cloud bills alone costing ~$15k per month, so the funding would be very welcome.\n\n**What other funding sources does ultra sound relay team have?**\nA 10 ETH per month no-strings-attached donation from a top MEV-boost builder is the primary funding source according to the team.\n\n**Any conflict of interest?**\nThe proposer ([Noun 40](https://twitter.com/noun40__)) has no prior (or planned future) personal or business relationship with anyone on the ultra sound relay team.  Reaching out to ask for permission to make this proposal was the first and only connection.\n\n**Why not also fund the Agnostic relay by the Gnosis team as well?**\nThe ETH prize felt a bit superflous given that the Gnosis DAO has a [$260M treasury](https://zapper.xyz/daos/gnosis-dao) of their own but they definitely deserve high praise for stepping up and maintaining a successful non-censoring public good relay as well!"},{"blockNumber":17424004,"blockHash":"0x3fbf977f0ca4ed874260fb4b550cc110d8c4357e737625a9faaeb913cbdb44f5","transactionIndex":154,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xf1a7d0b3f009498cab2c9e1681beabb511f24e9caf685fb64d125a06f5f28558","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":305,"proposer":"0xAd7Bbe006c8D919Ffcf6148b227Bb692F7D1fbc7","targets":["0xC79b099E83f6ECc8242f93d35782562b42c459F3"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":17460004,"endBlock":17496004,"description":"# NounsTennisFam (Feature Nouns/Noggles in grand slams/major tennis events and fund upcoming athletes)\n\n# Objective and Overview\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/W4qgnt8s/2.png)\n\n**NounsTennisFam (NTF)** is a Web3 sports platform co-founded by ATP Rank 20, Borna Ćorić, and led by CEO Bruno Pliso.

With the goal of becoming a cornerstone of the global tennis market valued at $5.6 billion, NounsTennisFam aims to represent athletes and connect fans under the NounsDAO banner in front of millions of fans worldwide.\n\n## Key Objectives\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/3Jn3LBfZ/3.png)\n- Noggles and NounsTennisFam (NTF) branded jerseys to be worn by co-founder Borna Coric (World No 20 Croatian tennis star) in grand slams and other major events, with millions of views and discussions about Nouns and NTF in pre/post-match press conferences.\n- Develop the \"NounsTennisFam\" platform to support up-and-coming athletes by funding them through the issuance of their own digital collectibles, which translates to a portion of the athletes' future game/endorsement earnings.\n- Gain support from athletes such as Real Madrid/Croatian football star Luka Modric, Grand Slam winner Marin Cilic, and others in Borna's network.\n- Provide branded NTF/Noggles competition apparel for all NTF-sponsored athletes, seen by millions.\n- Support underprivileged communities to ensure that economics do not stand in the way of talent.\n- Create new opportunities for fans to interact with sports, invest, and be a part of an athlete's journey from the beginning while learning about web 3 in the process.\n- Establish NounsTennis Fam as a household name in professional sports.\n\nThis collaboration presents a tremendous opportunity for NounsDAO to gain incredible exposure before a global audience and create lasting value for the brand while supporting emerging prospects and established professionals in the tennis industry.\n\n# Opportunity of a Lifetime\n\n## Tennis Viewership Numbers Reveal the Sport's Widespread Appeal and Growing Popularity\n\nMajor tournaments, all of which NTF Co-founder, Borna competes in, attract millions of viewers worldwide. In 2021, Wimbledon reached a global audience of over 500 million viewers, while the French Open and the Australian Open had 350 million and 900 million viewers, respectively (source: Grand Slam Board). This global audience provides a significant opportunity for NounsTennisFam to engage a passionate user base and secure NounsDAO significant exposure before an army of loyal fans.\n\n## Sports on the Blockchain\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, Inc., the global sports market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.3% from 2020 to 2027, driven by increasing participation in sports, the rising popularity of sports leagues, and the growing demand for sports-related merchandise. Although this report does not specifically address tennis, a Nielsen Sports report forecasts tennis viewership to continue growing in the United States, fueled by top players' popularity and the rise of new stars like Coco Gauff. The US Open, in particular, has experienced significant growth, with a 33% increase in average audience per match in 2021 compared to the previous year. This suggests the potential for the sport to continue to grow in popularity and reach new audiences, offering a substantial opportunity for NounsDAO to engage with a large audience eager for innovative solutions like the NounsTennisFam platform.\n\n## Success stories\n\n### Tennis Australia\n\nTennis Australia collaborated with the Australian Open to incorporate blockchain technology and NFTs into the event. The final bounce of winning points was linked to corresponding NFTs known as \"Artballs.\" Fans owning these NFTs won various rewards, such as tickets to the next year's tournament. The Australian Open also utilized the metaverse, creating a replica of the Rod Laver Arena in Decentraland and engaging with millions of users in a Roblox experience. These initiatives led to increased viewership and fan engagement, demonstrating the potential of blockchain technology in sports.\n\n### NBA Top Shot\n\nNBA Top Shot is a blockchain-based platform that allows fans to buy, sell, and trade officially licensed NBA collectible highlights (NFTs). Its success factors include a strategic partnership with the NBA, a user-friendly platform, and scarcity-driven value of collectibles.\n\n### Socios.com\n\nSocios.com is a blockchain-based fan engagement platform for sports teams. Its success factors include partnerships with top-tier football clubs, fan token offerings (FTOs), and voting rights for fans on certain club decisions.\n\nThese examples exhibit incredible potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize fan engagement, sports financing, and brand name recognition.\n\n## Key Benefits of Collaboration\n\n### Team and Experience\n\nBoasting Ivy League graduates, professional athletes, proven entrepreneurs, and Web3 experts, the NounsTennisFam team is prepared to catapult NounsDAO into the professional tennis spotlight as a fresh, inventive, and distinguished new brand.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/mZzdHWfk/Screen-Shot-2023-06-07-at-1-04-23-am.png)\n\n| [Co-founder Borna Ćorić](https://www.atptour.com/en/players/borna-coric/cg80/overview) | [Co-founder & CCO Bruna Ćorić](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruna-%C4%87ori%C4%87-916784b5/) | [Co-founder & CEO Bruno Pliso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-pliso-1a29a6176/) | [Creative Director Nina Turudic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolina-turudic-ab29b4b2/) |\n\n| [Finance & Operations Ivan Turudic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-turudi%C4%87-18657a155/) | [CTO Karlo Brdek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlo-brdek) | [CMO Sven Stanko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sven-stanko-545751ba/) | NFT Advisor, Dapper VP Fran Brajcic | [Web3 Consultant Shan Kumar](http://https://twitter.com/shanicucic96) |\n\n\n# Platform Features and User Experience\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1RNDSMdm/platform.png)\n\nNounsTennisFam platform offers a range of features designed to create a transparent, fair, and sustainable ecosystem to attract and connect tennis pros, new talent, and fans. \n\n1. **Platform & Launchpad:** The platform uses blockchain technology to establish a secure and transparent infrastructure to support emerging tennis talent. The NTF dApp enables fans to sponsor young and underprivileged players through funds generated by launchpad mints and commercial sponsorship deals. \n2. **Player Exclusive Launchpad & Drops**: This feature allows established players and potential professionals to tokenize a portion of their anticipated earnings, providing financial support. The platform offers two types of drops: Professional Drops (seasonal tokens) and Prospect Drops (sponsorship tokens), catering to different stages of a player’s career. \n3. **The Fam Section**: An exclusive content and social networking dashboard for NTF Asset holders, providing access to exclusive content, networking opportunities, and various benefits determined by the athletes. \n4. **Athletes & Valuation**: The platform features verified ATP and WTA players and up-and-coming prospects, with advisory and selection support from Borna’s management agency, Kozmos Holding. Drops are valued individually, with tokens representing a fraction of the total fractionalized prize money. Professional player valuations are based on historical performance data and a proprietary model, while prospect valuations involve negotiations and selection for either a Prospect pool or a Player exclusive drop, guided by the expertise of Kozmos Holding.\n\nTogether, NounsTennisFam and NounsDAO can actively support emerging tennis superstars by addressing one of their most significant challenges–funding, while providing a framework for established professionals to enter the Web3 space through fractionalized earnings. This approach will strengthen our brand and further democratizes the sport of tennis. Additionally, this collaboration will place NounsTennisFam at the forefront of a vast global tennis market, valued at $5.6 billion in 2019 (Source: ITF). Notably, 46% of global tennis fans have a household income of $75,000 or more (Source: ITF), representing a demographic well-suited to become NounsDAO community members.\n\n# Existing Partnerships and Collaborations\n\nNounsTennisFam has already established integral strategic partnerships with tennis academies, professional players, sport management giants, and Web3 projects that enhance the platform’s features and user experience. Our collaborations within the tennis industry allow us to tap into the impressive viewership numbers of events, such as the Wimbledon 2019, with a peak audience of 9.6 million viewers in the UK alone (Source: BBC), and the French Open 2020 final, with a peak audience of 3.3 million viewers in France (Source: SportsPro). \n\nThese partnerships provide credibility and enable NounsTennisFam to engage with tennis fans and connect with Web3 natives through our blockchain partners. By utilizing these alliances, we will expand our reach to tennis enthusiasts and the growing Web3 community, fostering a comprehensive and sustainable ecosystem for developing elite tennis talent and increasing fan engagement.\n\n## Meet our Athletes\n\nProfessional supporters actively promoting the platform and its vision to their extensive fan bases, generating global awareness and support for the project.\n\n- **Borna Ćorić** (ATP Rank #20)\n- **Luka Modrić** (Real Madrid)\n- **Ajla Tomljanović** (WTA Rank #47)\n- **Marin Cilic** (ATP Rank #22)\n- **Ana Konjuh** (WTA Rank #145)\n- **Marcelo Brozovic** (Midfielder, Inter Milan)\n- **Filip Krajinovic** (ATP Rank #65)\n- **Donna Vekic** (WTA Rank #32) \n\n## Web3 Collaborators\n\nOur Web3 partnership will bring fans and players together and help make tennis successful on the blockchain.

These risks can be mitigated by implementing proven risk management strategies, maintaining open communication with the NounsDAO community, and diversifying partnerships and collaborations.

The potential for audience engagement is evident in the 2022 US Open, where the third-round match between Serena Williams and Ajla Tomljanovich (Public Supporter of PTF) became the most-watched tennis telecast in ESPN’s 43-year history, with an average of 4.6 million viewers (ESPN Press Room, 2022). As tennis viewership continues to grow, the NounsTennisFam stands to benefit from increasing popularity within an immense, global audience of sports fans while building the NounsTennisFam brand. Together, we can positively impact the sport and its community, help shape the future, and gain significant brand recognition.\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/J4NJD0mS/Nouns-Tennis-Fam.png)\n"},{"blockNumber":17424762,"blockHash":"0xeffd0cbd8da6e6afcda952dea8138d8a2709ddf956a888de4e3e42825fcae99c","transactionIndex":82,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x39990ec7aed2eb4f543fb18092c7703c40bacfed16353ef69667a8094a5c9c6c","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":306,"proposer":"0xBd7Dbab9AEb52D6c8d0E80fCeBdE3af4CC86204A","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000004b4a63e170aac970f45522fb6669a6f268cd672f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d63445f00"],"startBlock":17460762,"endBlock":17496762,"description":"# SNP - SD Comic Con: Connecting a Cornucopia of Creators\n\n**TLDR:**\nNouns Town crew will head to SD Comic Con to gift 2,500 Nouns Activity Books to artists and collectors and commission 100+ Nounish artworks from industry pros + proliferate the meme through friends and peer collaborations.\nTotal cots $57,500.00\n\n## SD Comic Con: Connecting a Cornucopia of Creators\nSan Diego Comicon happens in July of 2023, and is a gathering of fans of pop culture, along with the artists that create content for them. With six figures of people walking through the doors, it has become one of the largest gatherings for talented people in the world. Those that write and draw comics, books, web series, movies and television, everyone goes to connect to the fans that keep them employed and appreciate them.\n\nBringing in outside artists to Nouns would be a huge boon to the ecosystem. It would bring different creative perspectives to an artistic project, but also bring in a fan base that currently has no real visibility to Nouns. If we engage creators, get them excited, we have already seen that they will then plug themselves into Nouns, engage with Nouns, while still engaging with the medium they are experts in.\n\nNouns is in a unique position to make dreams come true for creators that would otherwise be dissatisfied with their lot in their industry. If Eastman and Laird (the creators of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) had access to Nouns, not only would they have brought Nouns iconography to their books, but they would have had an outlet to seek funding, letting Nouns fund the Turtles, which would later become a licensing juggernaut. This is a perfect end use case for Nouns collabs with creators.\n\nOur first step is to go to San Diego, connect with as many creatives as we can. We will get them to do commissioned work (which we will pay for) in a special Nouns sketch book, of which we will print many copies. This will let us open a dialogue with them to discuss Nouns, cc0, the benefits of the ecosystem, and how they might benefit from introducing themselves here.\n\nWe will aim for over 100 creators’ commissions, giving Nouns many different versions and interpretations of Nouns and Nounish things from established artists, introduce the artists to us and cc0, and finally create inroads for further exploration in the near future. We will spread our net wide, but go for the premier artists in the industry (Jim Lee, Todd McFarlane, Geoff Darrow, etc.) along with the more traditional artists. Having been in this industry for two dozen years, I am comfortable saying I can have a conversation with any level of talent.\n\n**Nouns Sketch Book:** We will print 2,500 copies of a Nouns sketch book, with pages from the Nouns comic book contained within, as well as colouring pages, how to draw Nouns, and blank pages. We will give these away to creators, encouraging them to fill up the blank pages and give them back at the end.\n\n**Commission payments:** This is the main source of income for creators at conventions, so we will be paying for each commissioned work. We will specify that we wish something to do with Nouns (and the pages containing Nouns will give them plenty of reference material). The rate paid will be dependent upon the work they are doing, along with what their standard rate is. As a rough estimate, we will aim to pay $300 USD for a full sketch of a Noun in the creators’ style.\n\nWe will need to have the books printed and delivered to San Diego no later than July 17th of 2023. This means we wish to be at the printer by the last week of June, which is our goal. Having decades of experience making monthly comic books, I am comfortable saying this will be 100% achievable. We have the designers, printers, shipper and storage lined up. It was essential to plot out the viability of accomplishing this prior to suggesting it.\n\nWho: Nouns Town team of Danny Schlitz, Adam & Bennet + Joshua Fisher\n\n**How Much:**\n$15,000 USD - Creating, Printing and Shipping 2,500 Nouns Sketch Books\n$30,000 USD - Commission Payments for 100+ Commissions\n$12,5000 USD - Adam, Josh, Danny & Bennet will be there manage the facilitation of the books and creators, as well as scanning the art pieces for the DAO afterwards.

The first event, held in 2022, was financed by the 5ETH Small Grant from Nouns DAO. Primarily successful in Japan, we're planning to host the second event in 2023. This year, we aim to expand globally and attract more participants than before. The main objectives of the festival include:\n\n- Spreading awareness about the importance of a peaceful and sustainable Earth\n- Materializing the \"Public Good\" concept, which is integral to Nouns' principles\n- Broadening Nouns' recognition to a wider audience\n\nIn this proposal, we request a budget of 47.1ETH to accomplish these goals. The details follow.\n\n## Table of Contents ⌐◨-◨\n- Introduction\n- Our Commitment to This Film Festival\n- Preparations for the 2023 Festival\n  - Establishing New Submission Categories\n  - Intensifying Call for Entries\n  - Implementing a Participatory Voting System\n  - Enhancing Screenings and Award Ceremonies\n- Schedule\n- Budget\n- NounsFes Originators\n- Appendix: Achievements from 2022\n\n## Introduction ⌐◨-◨\nNounsFes is an online art festival, conceived by the members of NounsDAO, aiming to educate as many people as possible about the importance of a peaceful and sustainable Earth. Our theme, \"The Importance of a Peaceful and Sustainable Earth,\" embodies the principle of \"Public Good,\" which Nouns values greatly. This year, we aim to invite diverse submissions and offer more people an opportunity to understand the ideals behind Nouns and NounsFes.\n\n## Our Commitment to This Film Festival ⌐◨-◨\nWhile film festivals like the Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Awards are renowned, they're bound by traditional business models, prompting us to perceive a need for a new type of film festival. Information transmission methods vary from text, text and images, sound, sound and images, to video. It is clear that video is the most efficient way to communicate information. We believe that there is a huge future potential in short videos viewed through small smartphone screens, given the inconvenience of VR/AR glasses, despite emerging concepts like \"virtual space\" or \"metaverse.\"\n\n## Preparations for the 2023 Festival ⌐◨-◨\nThe first event in 2022 allowed us to introduce the importance of a peaceful and sustainable Earth within Japan via NounsFes. However, we have not yet managed to relay this concept to many who are unaware of Nouns. Hence, this year, we aim to familiarize more people with NounsFes and further disseminate the importance of a peaceful and sustainable Earth, and the principle of \"Public Good\" that Nouns values.\n\nNounsFes Updates:\n- Establishing new submission categories\n- Intensifying call for entries\n- Implementing a participatory voting system\n- Enhancing screenings and award ceremonies\n\n### 1. Introduction of New Categories\nThis year, we aim to encourage more people to submit more works by introducing new categories such as Short Video, Vertical Short Video, and Super Short Video. The added categories are designed to be easily accessible to anyone using their smartphones.\n\n- **Short Video Category**\n    The aim is to create 2-3 minute works that evoke emotions and contribute to a better future. The themes are love, peace, or sustainable earth (SDGs).\n    Example work: [Theme SDGs](https://youtu.be/bQoJqDi8490)\n[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/bQoJqDi8490/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQoJqDi8490)\n    \n\n- **Vertical Short Video Category**\n    With the same aim and themes as the Short Video Category, this category calls for works that fully utilize the verticality of smartphone-recorded daily life.\n[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/77mNcy0D-NU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77mNcy0D-NU)\n\n- **Super Short Video Category**\n    This category calls for works under 60 seconds with the same aim and themes as above, focusing on capturing the viewer's heart in a short time.\n[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6sSjPzsFvPA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sSjPzsFvPA)\n\n### 2. Strengthening the Collection of Works\nLast year, we received around 50 submissions. We are strengthening our efforts to attract more entries. The specific measures are as follows:\n1. Introduce new categories (Vertical Short Video and Super Short Video) to make it easier for more people to submit their works.\n2. Simplify the application process to ease the burden on applicants.\n3. Experiment with various new promotional activities.\n* Visit schools and directly approach students aspiring to be creators to encourage them to apply.\n* Conduct daily recruitment of submissions through official social media channels.\n* Renew the website and regularly update its content to attract more participants.\n* Run online commercials to generate interest and encourage applications from a wider audience.\n* Actively participate in various events and distribute leaflets to increase awareness.\n* Organize a press super-short video contest online to enhance visibility.\n* Collaborate with web3 influencers to become ambassadors and promote the event.\n* Implement various giveaway campaigns to generate interest and encourage participation.\n* Create mechanisms to provide real-time updates on application status and continue information dissemination.\n* Maintain ongoing communication and information dissemination to NounsDao and various Nouns sub-DAO members worldwide.\n* Utilize audio media and Twitter Spaces to regularly promote events and showcase submitted works. Specifically, collaborate with The NounSquare, a space hosted by pNouns every Friday, to disseminate information globally.\n\nThrough these publicity activities, ensure that the objectives of NounsFes are well-known and create an environment where many people submit their works.\n\n### 3. Establishing an All-Participation Voting System\nSubmitted works will be published on social media platforms (Youtube, TikTok) for review by participants with voting rights.\n\nLast year, we conducted voting using NFTs called \"Named Noun\" and \"Nouns Love\" from the collection as voting rights. This year, we will continue using these two NFTs as voting rights and further grant voting rights to NFT holders related to Nouns. This update aims to create a more accessible system for a larger number of people to participate in the voting process.\n\n### 4. Enrichment of Screening and Award Ceremonies\nThe award ceremony for outstanding works will be held after the screening. As before, we will host real events by renting a movie theater and invite the creators of the nominated works to walk the red carpet.\n\nFurthermore, at the venue, we will distribute/sell Nouns-related merchandise and conduct workshops to promote the various aspects of Nouns and enhance the excitement of the event. Many members of the Nouns proposal 228: NogglesJackTokyo are part of the project team this time. The event held on May 20-21, 2023, was a great success.\n\nHere are some examples of Nouns-related merchandise that were sold at that time.\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1030992113799798801/1117063446618456064/goods.jpg)\n\n\nThis is the movie of that time.\n{%youtube H2i0gGUXCnA %}\n\n\nThis time, we are accepting submissions from around the world. Attendance at the screening will be from various locations worldwide.\nFor those who cannot attend the venue on the day of the event, we aim to provide a virtual screening venue in metaverses or other virtual spaces, enabling a larger number of participants to join the screening.\n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1030992113799798801/1117063447000121344/MetaVerse.jpg)\n\n## Schedule ⌐◨-◨ \n- Announcement : 2023/7/1 \n- Submission Period : 2023/7/10 - 11/30\n- Nominee Announcement : 2023/12/10 \n- Final Result Announcement (Screening) : 2023/12/21 (tentative) \n\n## Budget ⌐◨-◨\n### Project Expense Breakdown\n- Planning, Operation, Accounting : 3.8 ETH\n- Website Development : 7.5 ETH\n- Content Management : 4.2 ETH\n- PR Activities : 4.5 ETH\n- Event Expenses : 3.8 ETH\n150,000 yen (theater), Travel and transportation expenses 300,000 yen (awardees), 500,000 yen (others)\n- Gift Expenses : 1.3 ETH\n\n### Prize Money\n- *Total: 22.0 ETH*\n  - Short category: Best: 3 ETH x 1, Excellence: 2 ETH x 2, Honorable mention: 1 ETH x 3\n  - Vertical Short category: 0.5 ETH x 10 \n  - Super Short category: 0.5 ETH x 10\n  - PR Pre-contest: 0.1 ETH x 20\n\n### Total Budget: 47.1 ETH\n(Note: The requested amount for this proposal)\n\n## Organizer\n[**Satoshi Nakajima**](https://twitter.com/nounsfes) - Software architect of Windows95 and Founder of Xevo Inc.(Noun245 Owner)\n\n### Supported by:\n\n[**Singularity Society**](https://www.singularitysociety.org/) - An organization created to provide entrepreneurs who have the potential to shoulder the next era of Japan and the world with opportunities for study, discussion, information dissemination, networking, and entrepreneurship, and to support them in various ways.\n\n[**NounsDAO JAPAN**](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOJAPAN) - Japanese biggest community of Nouns.

Please direct all questions to the NFT Yearbook team.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyW-BwaVh.jpg)\n\n## TLDR\n\n\nProposal for Funding from NOUNSDAO to Support the NFT Yearbook Project\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is a unique blend of a digital and physical artifact that boasts 420 pages and weighs 6.9 pounds. It is the largest democratically populated chronicling of the NFT space, and with the support of the NOUNSDAO, we aim to spread the word of web3, NOUNS, and cryptoart around the world, claiming our shared narrative and telling the story of web3 through the eyes of those building it.\n\nThe project has chronicled the web3 narrative from the very beginning to 2022, featuring contributions from over 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members through a democratic nomination process. The yearbook is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about the history and future of web3.\n\nWe believe that NOUNSDAO is a perfect fit for supporting the NFT Yearbook project. The DAO is a community of dedicated web3 enthusiasts who are passionate about spreading the word about this new technology. With the DAO's support, we can reach a wider audience and make a greater impact.\n  \n\nIn collaboration with NOUNSDAO, we propose:\na) Adding the NOUNS DAO logo, visuals, and content to all 3000 NFT Yearbooks.\nb) Creating a limited edition NFT Yearbook with a custom NOUNS cover, to be airdropped to all NOUNS holders.\nc) Printing and strategically placing 100 additional custom NOUNSDAO NFT Yearbooks around the world in stratigic libraries / museums such as Harvard Business School, which has already collected 2 NFT Yearbooks for their libraries and permanent archives.\n\nThe total cost for this proposal is 88.6815 Ξ\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B163wP6Eh.jpg)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project has captured a snapshot of the rapidly evolving web3 landscape. It's a comprehensive 420-page, 6.9lbs coffee table book, and a 3D digital readable. It spotlights over 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members, including many NOUNS fam.\nLink to participants list: https://twitter.com/i/lists/1559260935520411650 \n\nThroughout the past year, we've accumulated over 750 hours of recorded interviews, encapsulating the web3 narrative from the perspectives of those who are actively shaping it.\n\nA notable aspect of our project is its community-driven nature. The book was co-written and co-curated by the community. Each interviewee nominated other participants for the book, ensuring diversity, equality, and inclusivity.\n\nWe've also introduced a unique feature to increase engagement: blank content spaces as rarity traits. These spaces allow random NFT holders to contribute to the final version of the book, both digital and physical. See the 1/1 cover created by 0xDariush here: https://player.vimeo.com/video/826545378\n\nBeing a 100% bootstrapped and small team, we've strived to ensure that all artists involved in the project can profit from their contributions by creating a 1:1 cover for the book, auctioned on SuperRare, with 100% of the profits returning to the artists.\n\nIn a month and a half, our [1/1 sales](https://superrare.com/series/0x1e3eac91085df57b4aa417b1471349d0bdb19152) have reached 58.150Ξ. Moreover, three artists were invited to SuperRare thanks to the NFT Yearbook project. 79 artists took part in the 1/1 covers and our all-time high sale was 10ETH by thr33som3s.\n\nOur main collection of NFT Yearbooks is hosted on OpenSea, and we've sold 1277 units out of the 3000 total, to date.\n\nWe're proud to announce that the NFT Yearbook was already collected by libraries at Harvard University/HBS, and the books will be placed in their permanent archives. This opportunity would place a NOUNS DAO limited edition cover yearbook in two of the most significant academic libraries globally, cementing its cultural significance.\n\nWith this proposal we aim to increase the reach of the NOUNSDAO with the historically important content of the NFT Yearbook, to an additional 100 locations worldwide (famed libraries, galleries, etc.)= more NOUNS, everywhere!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJcF8D6Nn.jpg)\n\n## Project Details\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is a pioneering project that combines the physical and digital realms of art and literature. This 420-page coffee table book, weighing in at 6.9 lbs, captures the web3 narrative from the perspective of those who are actively building it. It is also available as a 3D digital readable yearbook, enhancing the experience of the readers.\n\nOver 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members, many from NOUNSDAO, are featured in this comprehensive collection. The book is a testament to the vibrancy and diversity of the web3 community, serving as a historical record of the NFT space till 2022.\n\nOur team has spent over 750 hours recording interviews, providing a wealth of insights and experiences. Additionally, each interviewee was given the opportunity to nominate other participants. This democratic approach to curation ensures that the final product is a true reflection of the community's diversity and inclusivity.\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is more than just a static record. It's a participatory project that invites engagement from its readers. A unique feature of the book is the opportunity for all holders to submit content for a blank space, making it a truly community-curated project.\n\n\n**The Team**\nThe book is created and published by Metaverse Publishing, a new bootstraped web3 company lead by co-founders @CryptoForager81, (Sol Fayerman-Hansen) the ex head of innovation at the Bank of Montreal and active in blockchain since 2014, and, @CryptoDashi (Dan Stern) who has 10 years of experience in e-Commerce entrepreneurship and DTC experiences creation.\nBoth have been degening since 2017. \nThe third co-founder of Metaverse publishing is a storied IRL coffee table book publisher with 30-years of experience and 300+ physical coffee table books produced, printed and shipped globally -Global Village Publishing.\n\n**Metaverse Publishing**\nThe NFT Yearbook is our first step, our contribution to this space.\nThis unique web3 + in-house IRL publishing capability positions Metaverse Publishing to create some real dope sh*t, and it all starts with The NFT Yearbook.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyfUUwT4h.jpg)\n\n## Market Validation\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project has already demonstrated its appeal and relevance within the community. In just a short span of time, we've managed to attract a passionate, dedicated community that actively participates in the project's development.\n\nThe project's notability extends beyond our community. The NFT Yearbook has been recognized by prestigious institutions, including Harvard University, which has included the yearbook in its library collection. This validation from such a renowned educational institution emphasizes the yearbook's cultural and academic significance.\n\nThe community's response has been overwhelmingly positive, with active engagement and enthusiasm for the project. NOUNS DAO members have been integral to the project, participating in decisions, suggesting ideas, and contributing content.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rySrovaEn.jpg)\n\n\n## Goals and Milestones\nHere are our specific goals and milestones:\n\n1. **Finalize the book design with NOUNS DAO:** With the funding, we aim to finalize the design of the book, incorporating the NOUNS DAO community's feedback and ensuring the highest quality. The NFT Yearbook is complete outside of NOUNS DAO content.\n   \n2. **Production:** Upon design finalization, we'll move into production. Each NFT Yearbook comes in digital and physical form, each beautifully bound and printed to the highest standards.\n\n3. **Distribution:** Once the yearbooks are printed, we will handle distribution. We aim to distribute the yearbooks to strategic libraries (two libraries at Harvard have already collected the book and will will be placed in their permanent archives), institutions, and individuals around the world, thereby spreading the influence and reach of our community's creative output. For any NOUNS that do not wish to receive their physical books to their address (anons), they will have the option of allowing us to place their books wherever they would like them...schools, libraries, hotels, etc.\n\n4. **Community Engagement:** As a key part of our mission, we will continue to engage our community in the development and refinement of the NFT Yearbook project. This includes seeking their input on design, content, and distribution strategies.\n\n5. **Placing 100 Limited Edition NOUNS Cover Yearbooks In Strategic Libraries / Museums :** With the funding of this prop, Metaverse Publishing will print ( and create the NFTs ) of 100 NOUNS cover NFT Yearbooks and place them in Strategic libraries and institutions. We'll start with Harvard Business School which already collected 2 NFT Yearbooks for their permanent libraries. We'll seek the communities support and recommendations to assist with this important mission. \n\n6. **Future Editions:** Securing this funding will help set the foundation for the production of future editions of the NFT Yearbook, ensuring that this becomes a tradition within our community, celebrating and documenting our achievements each year with NOUNS as a central figure in the future publications.\n\n7. **NOUNS 3D books** The NFT Yearbook will revolutionize NOUNSDAO book projects (past and future) by transforming them into interactive 3D readable books that can be minted, have AR and VR capabilities, can be read in virtual worlds, etc. \n\n8. **Open-source / free tools** We will give all NOUNSDAO community first access to our open-source and free 3D book creation software, which empowers artists and authors to create immersive and interactive books, enabling them to bring their stories to life in a captivating three-dimensional environment.\n\nSee The latest sample here: https://player.vimeo.com/video/826536881  and note that the layout displayed is not final.\n\n## The Impact\n→ Spreading the love: NOUNS will enter up to 3,075 new homes + 100 major, strategic public locations, worldwide.\n\n→ NOUNS and the NFT Yearbook go to Harvard Business School + 100 libraries / museums / galleries / schools...forever!\nThe NFTYB was collected by 2 libraries in Harvard Business School and once printed, will be placed in Baker Library and the main Harvard library on campus. Plus, we will reserve 10 additional units to be collected by future libraries/archives.\n\n→ Supporting the largest-ever chronicling of the Space , and contributing to this historical project.\n\n→ Supporting an innovative bootstrapped web3 company, seeking to spearhead publishing 3.0 and empower the next gen of creators of web3.\n\n→ Create a new experience for past and future books supported by the DAO. We’re working on making all Metaverse Publishing books compatible in online galleries, VR and AR platforms, as well as metaverse platforms (for example, OnCyber).\n\n\n## Project Timeline\n\nNFT Yearbook Timeline:\n\nInterviews: Completed prior to the timeline start.\nWriting of the Book: Completed prior to the timeline start.\nPublic Sale: Completed prior to the timeline start.\n\nRemaining Tasks:\n\n**Completion of Community Content (May 2023):**\nMay 1-28, 2023: Gather and review community submissions (including NOUNSDAO).\nMay 16-25, 2023: Samples - Quality control checks and adjustments, if necessary.\nMay 28-31, 2023: Incorporate the community content into the book and prepare the finalized book layout for printing.\n\n**Physical Printing of the Books (June/July 2023):**\nJune 1-30, 2023: Print the NFT Yearbook.\n\n**Shipping (End of July 2023):**\nJuly 3-16, 2023: Prepare for shipping, including packaging and labeling.\nJuly 17, 2023: Open physical claim and begin shipping the NFT Yearbooks to customers.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1hTTPp43.jpg)\n\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n\n**The total budget for the NFT Yearbook project is 88.6815 ETH**\n\nHere's how it will be allocated:\n\n**Commission for NOUNS Limited Edition Cover:**\nA total of 3 ETH will be allocated for commissioning an artist, voted by NOUNS Prop House to create three different versions of the limited edition cover.\n\n**Production and Delivery of Books:** The rest of the funds, which total 88.6815 ETH, will be allocated to Metaverse Publishing for the production and delivery of the NFT Yearbooks.

By incorporating NOUNS DAO into this historical chronicle and funding the placment of 100 books in strategic libraries around the world, we are not only recognizing the significant role of the DAO and its members in shaping the web3 landscape, but we are also furthering our commitment to diversity, equality, inclusivity and building a community driven narrative of the amazing world of web3.\n\nThe proposed budget of 88.6815 ETH will enable the production and delivery of a limited edition NFT Yearbook featuring a unique NOUNS DAO cover, both in digital and physical formats and placing an additional 100 NOUNS NFT Yearbooks in strategic locations around the world. This endeavor will help NOUNS DAO to have a tangible and lasting impact, reaching up to 3,075 new homes worldwide, and even prestigious institutions like Harvard Business School.\n\nBy supporting this project, NOUNS DAO will contribute to an important historical project, while also paving the way for the future of publishing in the web3 space. The NFT Yearbook not only represents a snapshot of the current state of the NFT community, but it also serves as a vision of what the community can accomplish in the future.\n\nWe appreciate your consideration of this proposal and look forward to the opportunity of working with NOUNS DAO on this significant project.\n\nTransaction summary: 88.6815 Ξ to:\n0x6029Db0Ea27F7e71Fcc9FfAe8e31C99A46626511"},{"blockNumber":17472136,"blockHash":"0x6f7b75d9b7aa6b6d1e5178e3f41d323ec89b762ac5ac44a155bcfbcca7eeac86","transactionIndex":51,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x549c0b96c653b4e6eea1351d4dbee1325ad4fc4c2495803e5594c90915fb2263","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":310,"proposer":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000004756e5a5d0668195feb1ec0e7f96832ffc51c4a80000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000df8475800"],"startBlock":17508136,"endBlock":17544136,"description":"# Nounish Animations for Kids on YouTube Channel\n\nWe propose to create a YouTube channel that features Nounish musical animations for kids.

We invite you to read our full proposal for comprehensive details.\n\n## What We've Done During This Term\n\nWe spent most of our time and energy (by far) on the upcoming [**DAO V3**](https://twitter.com/eladmallel/status/1661510219342524417?s=20) upgrade:\n\n1. Designing [Nouns Fork](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/iN0FKOn_oYVBzlJkwPwK2mhzaeL8K2-W80u82F7fHj8).\n2. Merging it into the original V3 scope.\n3. Testing this version and getting it audited by [Spearbit](https://spearbit.com/) and [code4rena](https://nouns.wtf/vote/302).\n\nOther projects:\n* Led the [private voting research mandated round](https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint), which we believe so far to be successful in making Nouns interesting to other Ethereum and zk folks; we hope to preserve this momentum in the near future.\n* Shipped [Nouns Streamer](https://twitter.com/davidbrai/status/1625215669582147585).\n* Landed on an Airdrop design through [a Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/nouns.eth/proposal/0xebe4aec5b96dc5c008902da341bcd4936f5aa09baf73daaa545259183b203089).\n* Gave [a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw_GU6Gs81o) at ETH Denver.\n\n\nFor even more context, [see our previous proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/192).\n\n## Retrospective\n\n### On Communication\n\n**TL;DR: We should over-communicate our decisions and our status.**\n\nWorking for the DAO means addressing diverse stakeholders and their varied views, and dealing with new members unfamiliar with past discussions or decisions. While it's impossible to appease everyone, we aim to strike a balance between involving voters and maintaining autonomy to execute tasks efficiently.\n\nIn our current term we revived [our Snapshot account](https://snapshot.org/#/nouns.eth/) and involved the DAO in choosing its favorite \"airdrop\" design, and in confirming our sense that most Nouns wanted the fork to get shipped ASAP. We will continue to use this communication channel whenever we identify a decision important enough to ask for such attention.\n\nDespite our intention to keep the DAO informed, we've heard that some feel out of the loop, and some are concerned about how and why decisions were made.\n\nMoving forward, we'll prioritize frequent communication about our projects, rationale, and key decisions. We'll use varied formats like blog posts and Twitter discussions to update and receive feedback or ideas to optimize our service to the DAO.\n\n### On Organization\n\nDecentralization, or resilience, seems very important to the DAO. Many voters want to ensure Nouns does not have a single point of failure anywhere, so Nouns may live long and prosper forever(ish). And we've heard some concerns saying we could be doing more on this front.\n\nSo we've been wondering: how might we get more talented builders creating software for/with Nouns? How can we have more parallel processing in areas like smart contracts and other infrastructure needs, much like the success we've had with the governance clients and private voting mandated rounds? And how can we design process and tech to become more resilient and unstoppable?\n\nWe don't have a fully worked-out answer to these questions, but we're curious to try different ideas in this vein. Some questions on our minds:\n\n* How might we better incentivize multiple autonomous teams to contribute smart contracts to Nouns?\n* How might we create more collaborations with top crypto teams?\n* What should be the future of nouns.wtf? Sunset or maintained as an important reference client? and if maintained, by whom?\n* What are distributed work practices we can adopt from others like the Ethereum Foundation and its collaboration with the various client teams?\n\nWe believe figuring all this out can be instrumental in positioning Nouns as a leader in the Ethereum space, and one of the most attractive places to join as a Nouner, builder, delegate or fan.\n\n\n## What's Next\n\nWe expect technical work to continue taking up the vast majority of our time and energy; this term we plan to spend more time than before on proliferation of Nouns tech and collaboration with more tech teams.\n\n### Technical\n\nWe're sharing below our current plan, and emphasizing again that it's absolutely subject to change as we learn more doing the work, or if community members share ideas that are worth changing priorities for.\n\n#### Follow-Through\n\nWe hope these items won't take up much time, but making it clear that as long as these items need our attention, they are top priority.\n\n1. **Art storage compatibility break**: in the next Ethereum upgrade [EIP-3540](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3540) should go into effect. This change means our current art contract will not be able to store new art, while it can still read existing art. We will come up with a plan to handle this change.\n2. **DAO V3**: monitor this version on mainnet, be around for questions and any bug fixing that may arise.\n3. **Fork DAOs frontend**: for forks to have UI for governance and auction, a minor modification of the nouns.wtf code.\n4. **Private voting**: help the DAO crystalize learnings from this prop house round, and decide how to proceed.\n\n#### High Priority\n\nThese projects get us really excited. We would start on these as soon as V3 is live and the above musts are in good shape.\n\n1. **Nouns Governor**\n   Nouns DAO was launched as a fork of Compound Governor Bravo, and to this day remains similar in key aspects. Since then a lot has changed, the DAO landscape has evolved, and here specifically at Nouns we're hitting some walls continuing to rely on the original design. It's time to go back to first principles.\n   \n   The foundation of this new governor design is using NFT-based voting. In today's design voters have a numeric votes balance, an inheritance from Compound's ERC20-based DAO. A Nouns design would be NFT-based, where NFTs are the voters rather than wallets. Some of the benefits of NFT-based voting:\n   * No more snapshot block confusion.\n   * Granular delegation, one Noun at a time.\n   * Fork V2 (see below).\n   * Token owners can override their delegate's vote.\n   * and more.\n   \n   Other changes we're considering are too raw to articulate here; they will be part of our preliminary research, and will be communicated to the community as soon as possible.\n2. **Collaborations with other teams**\n   We'd like to work with leading teams in their fields, to help move the needle for Nouns and the DAO ecosystem. Key examples are:\n   * **Private voting**: work with leading zk teams (likely from the first mandated round) towards building experimental private voting governors on mainnet.\n   * **L2 voting**: collaborate with leading teams to experiment with voting on L2.\n   \n   We will explore additional collaboration opportunities as well, including other teams building governance smart contracts.\n\n#### Medium Priority\n\nBig projects:\n\n1. **Fork V2**\n   The full scope of improvements requires further research. We can say we're hoping to mitigate the current flaw where a majority can follow a forking minority into their fork, making the fork DAO yet another bad environment for the forkers; a solution we have in mind involves NFT-based voting, or other technical approaches that were out of scope for this first version.\n2. **Rank-choice proposals**\n   A long-standing favorite of ours we deemed less urgent so far; it can enable builders to offer multiple variations of their project in a single onchain proposal, hitting more optimal DAO<>builder agreements faster.\n   \nSmaller projects:\n\n3. **Tip governance clients**\n   We're super excited about this one! the idea is for the DAO to send ETH to governance clients' wallets the more they generate votes and proposals onchain, to better incentivize them to create the best UX and features for voters and proposers, and have long-term sustainability.\n5. **Undo vote**\n   Like Gmail's undo send shortly after you send an email, only for votes, to help people fix their voting mistakes (yes, they are still happening).\n\n#### Low Priority\n\n1. AuctionHouse V2: mainly introduces a new onchain price history feed. The project is already coded, next we'll need to run more tests and get it audited.\n2. [Airdrops](https://snapshot.org/#/nouns.eth/proposal/0xebe4aec5b96dc5c008902da341bcd4936f5aa09baf73daaa545259183b203089): we would follow the DAO's choice to build a Nouns Buyer contract. \n3. DAO-controlled multisigs: a Gnosis Safe extension such that multisigs created for Nouns proposals will include the DAO as an admin that can execute arbitrary transactions from those Safes.\n4. Streamer frontend: a web client showing all streams created by the DAO, allowing recipients to view and withdraw from their streams, and allowing Nouns voters to propose to cancel any open stream.\n\n\n### Proliferation & Collaboration\n\nWe would like to do more in this area than we've done so far, while still dedicating the vast majority of our time to the technical projects mentioned above.\n\nSome examples on our mind:\n\n* Github repo house cleaning, for forkers and community members to easily use\n* Initiate new collaborations with well-known teams, as mentioned above.\n* Create more compelling content about Nouns tech, e.g. by working with Nounish.\n* Research ways to onboard more autonomous solidity teams, e.g. incentivize and fund teams to create alternative governor contracts.\n\nWe believe a multi-governor future can be exciting, however this vision isn't clear enough yet to elaborate in this proposal. We'd like to continue discussing this vision with other token holders and community members who feel excited about it.\n\n## Compensation & Terms\n\n* 6 month engagement starting August 1, 2023.\n* Payment done via streams controlled by the DAO, cancelable via proposal.\n* $37.5k per person (2) per month (6) paid in USDC.\n* 3 ETH per month to Solimander, for time spent meeting with the team, reviewing designs and code, and supporting audits and rollout.\n* Total: 450,000 USDC, 18 ETH.\n* Additional funding for things like audits, mandated rounds and other experiments will be requested separately as needs arise.\n\n---\n\nFor any questions, we're available on the NCD discord server and on twitter.\n\n\n[david](https://twitter.com/davidbrai) & [elad](https://twitter.com/eladmallel)\nverbs team ⌐◨-◨"},{"blockNumber":17483618,"blockHash":"0x2437816ee6ea42764947ae49b5e8ff36ec04d3cd3d03da366da91d6db932a5f2","transactionIndex":109,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x205eb3905c0efcb1ecfb07d888097caab250b5e4e18f3f8c1495412653155449","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":312,"proposer":"0x8E71bc5B07E7A2B188c50D55E346AFAA208bf7bE","targets":["0x6029Db0Ea27F7e71Fcc9FfAe8e31C99A46626511"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":17519618,"endBlock":17555618,"description":"# NFT Yearbook Prop\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyW-BwaVh.jpg)\n\n## TLDR\n\n\nProposal for Funding from NOUNSDAO to Support the NFT Yearbook Project\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is a unique blend of a digital and physical artifact that boasts 420 pages and weighs 6.9 pounds. It is the largest democratically populated chronicling of the NFT space, and with the support of the NOUNSDAO, we aim to spread the word of web3, NOUNS, and cryptoart around the world, claiming our shared narrative and telling the story of web3 through the eyes of those building it.\n\nThe project has chronicled the web3 narrative from the very beginning to 2022, featuring contributions from over 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members through a democratic nomination process. The yearbook is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about the history and future of web3.\n\nWe believe that NOUNSDAO is a perfect fit for supporting the NFT Yearbook project. The DAO is a community of dedicated web3 enthusiasts who are passionate about spreading the word about this new technology. With the DAO's support, we can reach a wider audience and make a greater impact.\n  \n\nIn collaboration with NOUNSDAO, we propose:\na) Adding the NOUNS DAO logo, visuals, and content to all 3000 NFT Yearbooks.\nb) Creating a limited edition NFT Yearbook with a custom NOUNS cover, to be airdropped to all NOUNS holders.\nc) Printing and strategically placing 100 additional custom NOUNSDAO NFT Yearbooks around the world in strategic libraries / museums such as Harvard Business School, which has already collected 2 NFT Yearbooks for its libraries and permanent archives.\n\nThe total cost for this proposal is 88.6815 Ξ\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B163wP6Eh.jpg)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project has captured a snapshot of the rapidly evolving web3 landscape. It's a comprehensive 420-page, 6.9lbs coffee table book, and a 3D digital readable. It spotlights over 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members, including many NOUNS fam.\nLink to participants list: https://twitter.com/i/lists/1559260935520411650 \n\nThroughout the past year, we've accumulated over 750 hours of recorded interviews, encapsulating the web3 narrative from the perspectives of those actively shaping it.\n\nA notable aspect of our project is its community-driven nature. The book was co-written and co-curated by the community. Each interviewee nominated other participants for the book, ensuring diversity, equality, and inclusivity.\n\nWe've also introduced a unique feature to increase engagement: blank content spaces as rarity traits. These spaces allow random NFT holders to contribute to the final version of the book, both digital and physical.\n\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJHoroBDn.png)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/826545378)\n\n\n*A 1/1 cover created by 0xDariush*\n\nBeing a 100% bootstrapped and small team, we've strived to ensure that all artists involved in the project can profit from their contributions by creating a 1:1 cover for the book, auctioned on SuperRare, with 100% of the profits returning to the artists.\n\nIn a month and a half, our [1/1 sales](https://superrare.com/series/0x1e3eac91085df57b4aa417b1471349d0bdb19152) have reached 58.150Ξ. Moreover, three artists were invited to SuperRare thanks to the NFT Yearbook project. 79 artists participated in the 1/1 covers and our all-time high sale was 10ETH by thr33som3s.\n\nOur main collection of NFT Yearbooks is hosted on OpenSea, and we've sold 1277 units out of the 3000 total, to date.\n\nWe're proud to announce that the NFT Yearbook was already collected by libraries at Harvard University/HBS, and the books will be placed in their permanent archives. This opportunity would place a NOUNS DAO limited edition cover yearbook in two of the most significant academic libraries globally, cementing its cultural significance.\n\nWith this proposal, we aim to increase the reach of the NOUNSDAO with the historically important content of the NFT Yearbook, to an additional 100 locations worldwide (famed libraries, galleries, etc.)= more NOUNS, everywhere!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJcF8D6Nn.jpg)\n\n## Project Details\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is a pioneering project that combines the physical and digital realms of art and literature. This 420-page coffee table book, weighing in at 6.9 lbs, captures the web3 narrative from the perspective of those who are actively building it. It is also available as a 3D digital readable yearbook, enhancing the experience of the readers.\n\nOver 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members, many from NOUNSDAO, are featured in this comprehensive collection. The book is a testament to the vibrancy and diversity of the web3 community, serving as a historical record of the NFT space till 2022.\n\nOur team has spent over 750 hours recording interviews, providing a wealth of insights and experiences. Additionally, each interviewee was given the opportunity to nominate other participants. This democratic approach to curation ensures that the final product is a true reflection of the community's diversity and inclusivity.\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is more than just a static record. It's a participatory project that invites engagement from its readers. A unique feature of the book is the opportunity for all holders to submit content for a blank space, making it a truly community-curated project.\n\n\n![](https://nftyearbook.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Video_23-02-05_12-13-53-2.gif)\n\n**The Team**\nThe book is created and published by Metaverse Publishing, a new bootstrapped web3 company lead by co-founders @CryptoForager81, (Sol Fayerman-Hansen) the ex-head of innovation at the Bank of Montreal and active in blockchain since 2014, and, @CryptoDashi (Dan Stern) who has 10 years of experience in e-Commerce entrepreneurship and DTC experiences creation.\nBoth have been degening since 2017. \nThe third co-founder of Metaverse Publishing is a storied IRL coffee table book publisher with 30-years of experience and 300+ physical coffee table books produced, printed and shipped globally -Global Village Publishing.\n\n**Metaverse Publishing**\nThe NFT Yearbook is our first step, our contribution to this space.\nThis unique web3 + in-house IRL publishing capability positions Metaverse Publishing to create some real dope sh*t, and it all starts with The NFT Yearbook.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyfUUwT4h.jpg)\n\n## Market Validation\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project has already demonstrated its appeal and relevance within the community. In just a short span of time, we've managed to attract a passionate, dedicated community that actively participates in the project's development.\n\nThe project's notability extends beyond our community. The NFT Yearbook has been recognized by prestigious institutions, including Harvard University, which has included the yearbook in its library collection. This validation from such a renowned educational institution emphasizes the yearbook's cultural and academic significance.\n\nThe community's response has been overwhelmingly positive, with active engagement and enthusiasm for the project. NOUNS DAO members have been integral to the project, participating in decisions, suggesting ideas, and contributing content.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rySrovaEn.jpg)\n\n\n## Goals and Milestones\nHere are our specific goals and milestones:\n\n1. **Finalize the book design with NOUNS DAO:** With the funding, we aim to finalize the design of the book, incorporating the NOUNS DAO community's feedback and ensuring the highest quality. The NFT Yearbook is complete outside of NOUNS DAO content.\n   \n2. **Production:** Upon design finalization, we'll move into production. Each NFT Yearbook comes in digital and physical form, each beautifully bound and printed to the highest standards.\n\n3. **Distribution:** Once the yearbooks are printed, we will handle distribution. We aim to distribute the yearbooks to strategic libraries (two libraries at Harvard have already collected the book and will be placed in their permanent archives), institutions, and individuals around the world, thereby spreading the influence and reach of our community's creative output. For any NOUNS that do not wish to receive their physical books to their address (anons), they will have the option of allowing us to place their books wherever they would like them...schools, libraries, hotels, etc.\n\n4. **Community Engagement:** As a key part of our mission, we will continue to engage our community in the development and refinement of the NFT Yearbook project. This includes seeking their input on design, content, and distribution strategies.\n\n5. **Placing 100 Limited Edition NOUNS Cover Yearbooks In Strategic Libraries / Museums :** With the funding of this prop, Metaverse Publishing will print ( and create the NFTs ) of 100 NOUNS cover NFT Yearbooks and place them in Strategic libraries and institutions. We'll start with Harvard Business School which has already collected 2 NFT Yearbooks for its permanent libraries. We'll seek the community's support and recommendations to assist with this important mission. \n\n6. **Future Editions:** Securing this funding will help set the foundation for the production of future editions of the NFT Yearbook, ensuring that this becomes a tradition within our community, celebrating and documenting our achievements each year with NOUNS as a central figure in the future publications.\n\n7. **NOUNS 3D books** The NFT Yearbook will revolutionize NOUNSDAO book projects (past and future) by transforming them into interactive 3D readable books that can be minted, have AR and VR capabilities, can be read in virtual worlds, etc. \n\n8. **Open-source / free tools** We will give all NOUNSDAO community first access to our open-source and free 3D book creation software, which empowers artists and authors to create immersive and interactive books, enabling them to bring their stories to life in a captivating three-dimensional environment.\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByUlBoSv3.png)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/826536881)\n\n\n*The latest sample - the layout displayed is not final*\n\n## The Impact\n→ Spreading the love: NOUNS will enter up to 3,075 new homes + 100 major, strategic public locations, worldwide.\n\n→ NOUNS and the NFT Yearbook go to Harvard Business School + 100 libraries / museums / galleries / schools...forever!\nThe NFTYB was collected by 2 libraries in Harvard Business School and once printed, will be placed in Baker Library and the main Harvard library on campus. Plus, we will reserve 10 additional units to be collected by future libraries/archives.\n\n→ Supporting the largest-ever chronicling of the space, and contributing to this historical project.\n\n→ Supporting an innovative bootstrapped web3 company, seeking to spearhead publishing 3.0 and empower the next gen of creators of web3.\n\n→ Create a new experience for past and future books supported by the DAO. We’re working on making all Metaverse Publishing books compatible in online galleries, VR and AR platforms, as well as metaverse platforms (for example, OnCyber).\n\n\n## Project Timeline\n\nNFT Yearbook Timeline:\n\nInterviews: Completed prior to the timeline start.\nWriting of the Book: Completed prior to the timeline start.\nPublic Sale: Completed prior to the timeline start.\n\nRemaining Tasks:\n\n**Completion of Community Content (May 2023):**\nMay 1-28, 2023: Gather and review community submissions (including NOUNSDAO).\nMay 16-25, 2023: Samples - Quality control checks and adjustments, if necessary.\nMay 28-31, 2023: Incorporate the community content into the book and prepare the finalized book layout for printing.\n\n**Physical Printing of the Books (June/July 2023):**\nJune 1-30, 2023: Print the NFT Yearbook.\n\n**Shipping (End of July 2023):**\nJuly 3-16, 2023: Prepare for shipping, including packaging and labeling.\nJuly 17, 2023: Open physical claim and begin shipping the NFT Yearbooks to customers.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1hTTPp43.jpg)\n\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n\n**The total budget for the NFT Yearbook project is 88.6815 ETH**\n\nHere's how it will be allocated:\n\n**Commission for NOUNS Limited Edition Cover:**\nA total of 3 ETH will be allocated for commissioning an artist, voted by NOUNS Prop House to create three different versions of the limited edition cover.\n\n**Production and Delivery of Books:** The rest of the funds, which total 88.6815 ETH, will be allocated to Metaverse Publishing for the production and delivery of the NFT Yearbooks. This allocation includes:\n- Printing and placing an additional 100 NOUNS Cover NFT Yearbooks in strategic locations, worldwide, starting with Harvard Business School.\n- Cost of producing the digital and physical versions of the NFT Yearbook with the limited edition NOUNS DAO cover.\n- Cost of delivery, which includes worldwide shipping and taxes.\n- The claim for the 6.9lbs physical coffee table book.\n\nThe allocation is based on the public mint price of the book (0.1195 ETH per book), multiplied by the total number of books (717 books).\n\nThe funds will be transferred to the Metaverse Publishing multisig Safe wallet.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJjV0w6Nh.jpg)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project is an innovative initiative to preserve and celebrate the vibrant, diverse, and rapidly evolving web3 community. By incorporating NOUNS DAO into this historical chronicle and funding the placement of 100 books in strategic libraries around the world, we are not only recognizing the significant role of the DAO and its members in shaping the web3 landscape, but we are also furthering our commitment to diversity, equality, inclusivity and building a community driven narrative of the amazing world of web3.\n\nThe proposed budget of 88.6815 ETH will enable the production and delivery of a limited edition NFT Yearbook featuring a unique NOUNS DAO cover, both in digital and physical formats and placing an additional 100 NOUNS NFT Yearbooks in strategic locations around the world. This endeavor will help NOUNS DAO to have a tangible and lasting impact, reaching up to 3,075 new homes worldwide, and even prestigious institutions like Harvard Business School.\n\nBy supporting this project, NOUNS DAO will contribute to an important historical project, while also paving the way for the future of publishing in the web3 space. The NFT Yearbook not only represents a snapshot of the current state of the NFT community, but it also serves as a vision of what the community can accomplish in the future.\n\nWe appreciate your consideration of this proposal and look forward to the opportunity of working with NOUNS DAO on this significant project.\n\n"},{"blockNumber":17494569,"blockHash":"0x2c96555b56bb0ffa8bdd7de769f8b11b0a2f56a58aa7dfefa433c993c2fdce07","transactionIndex":177,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xa13ee143f67ea360d18129d6a7dbce1781b0b78af9945db1560de1c7b3b8ddf8","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":313,"proposer":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000000f8a5076a56b7ecd761562551fad11df631447b200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ee6b2800"],"startBlock":17530569,"endBlock":17566569,"description":"# stETH peg protection\n\n## Summary\n\nNounsDAO currently holds over $26M in stETH, which represents more than 50% of the treasury. Currently, the DAO is not hedged against the [risks](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230603-what-are-the-risks-of-staking-with-lido) associated with stETH. The DAO can derisk these holdings by purchasing [stETH depeg protection](https://www.cozy.finance/protection-market/0x3b548fbadc2d926adb7e5a5d44d824a1c7f3614d) on Cozy v2 protocol. \n\nBy doing so, NounsDAO will:\n\n- Hedge against protocol risk for stETH\n- Enable the DAO to execute transactions on L2, starting with Optimism\n\nBoth of these outcomes will help the DAO proliferate Nouns. The former protects the income generating portion of the treasury. The latter establishes a NounsDAO footprint on a lower fee environment chain, increasing accessibility.\n\nAs a starting point, the DAO could protect $1M worth of stETH for roughly 12 ETH. This protection would cost an estimated 1.5% APR, compared to staking yields of 4-6% APR. There’s also a one-time cost of $4k to audit the contracts required to buy the protection on Optimism.  \n\n## Cozy Protection\n\nHere’s how Cozy protection works:\n\n1. Buy protection tokens from the stETH depeg market\n2. If stETH depegs below 50%, the market “triggers” enabling protection token holders to claim a payout\n\nSo if something bad happens to stETH causing a 50%+ depeg, the DAO can recoup its losses based on how much protection it holds.\n\nYou can learn more [here](https://www.cozy.finance/) and in the [docs](https://www.notion.so/1272a15348dc481b9de0e29a33b81c04?pvs=21).\n\n## NounsDAO on Optimism\n\nTo buy protection on the Cozy protocol, the DAO needs a way to execute transactions on Optimism. The DAO can use a proxy contract deployed to Optimism, “L1Proxy,” to execute transactions.\n\nThe DAO on L1 would execute transactions on L1Proxy by sending messages through [Optimism messengers](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/messaging/) from L1. L1Proxy has an `owner` role which would be the DAO address on L1, and has an authed function which checks [xDomainMessageSender](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/messaging/#accessing-msg-sender) == `owner` that can execute arbitrary transactions. \n\nOnce deployed, the DAO would be able to fund the L1Proxy by using a bridge like Hop.\n\nYou can review the verified contracts [here]. \n\n## Trustlessly buying protections\n\nOnce the L1Proxy is deployed, the DAO can now execute transactions on L2 from L1. To buy protection from the Cozy protocol, the DAO can use the [tokenbuyer contract](https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer) developed by the Verbs team with a custom pricefeed. The DAO would fund the tokenbuyer with ETH, specify a price (e.g. $2 per $100 of protection, or ~1.5% APR), and a third party can swap protection tokens for ETH at that price. \n\nClick here to review the contracts for the [token buyer](https://github.com/portaldiscovery/cozy-v2-token-buyer) and the [cross-chain proxy](https://github.com/portaldiscovery/optimism-cross-chain-proxy).\n\n## How it works all together\n\n- **Setup:** Deploy L1Proxy and tokenbuyer on Optimism\n- ********************Proposal:******************** Set the purchase price in the tokenbuyer and bridge ETH to the tokenbuyer\n- ********************Followup:******************** Transfer protection tokens from the tokenbuyer to the L1Proxy\n\n![Untitled](https://cozyfinance.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F368d12be-ce44-4b5b-a0e1-5c94020539f3%2FUntitled.png?id=a93f5bc8-605f-4728-8fad-fcf160832739&table=block&spaceId=2f87461d-478a-4b6b-8c56-3d60c2901f5c&width=1440&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n## How this proliferates Nouns\n\nFunding proposals using the treasury is the singular proliferation mechanism for Nouns. Balancing income generation with risk management is essential for the long term viability of this mechanism. Showing that the DAO can earn income on treasury assets and hedge risk strengthens the DAO’s ability to continue funding proliferation. \n\nCozy can also be used to protect other LSDs like Rocketpool ETH. Managing protocol risk for other LSDs could make it easier for the DAO to diversify. \n\nFurther, the newly established footprint on L2 opens up exciting possibilities to expand Nouns to lower cost chainspace, increasing accessibility to a more mass market audience.\n\nSome potential use cases include:\n\n- Funding a multisig on optimism to distribute microgrants\n- Open edition mints on Zora\n- Streaming payments\n- On-chain prophouse\n\n## Funding\n\nThe following can be accomplished with 13 ETH and 4000 USDC. \n\n- 4000 USDC for a [Veridise](https://veridise.com/) audit\n- 12 ETH would be used to fund the token buyer. This will all get converted into stETH depeg protection tokens.\n\n## Proposal ops\n\nThis proposal requires two on-chain proposals. The first to audit the two contracts. The second to fund the tokenbuyer that will acquire the Cozy protection.\n\n1. (We are here) Transfer 4000 USDC to Veridise for the audit of the contracts\n2. (Follow up) Transfer 12 ETH to the tokenbuyer, which will get converted into Cozy protection\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFor ~15 ETH, the DAO is getting $1M+ of stETH depeg protection and an address on Optimism that the DAO can control directly through governance. Both outcomes empower the DAO to further proliferate Nouns by funding Nounish projects. \n\nIf you have any questions about the proposal, join this [discussion telegram group](https://t.me/+rfuoI8SkzxdhYjRh).\n\n## FAQs\n\n**How much does protection cost?**\n\nProtection is priced by a bonding curve reflecting supply and demand. The current price is ~$1.4 per $100 of protection and at 80% utilization, the price would be $2. \n\nBecause the DAO will be buying through the tokenbuyer contract, it should set a price slightly above market to create a small arbitrage opportunity, incentivizing third parties to swap.\n\n**How long will protection last?**\n\nProtection on Cozy v2 is perpetual. It decays at a 50% per year. So protection for $1M at the start of the year will cover $500K at the end of the year. \n\n**What’s the APR of the protection?**\n\nThe estimated APR is ~1.5%. \n\nThis value factors in the proceeds of selling back the protection at the end of the year and normalizes for the decay rate. In this example, the DAO could expect to recoup ~$0.9 per $100 of protection initially purchased. And the average protection amount over the course of the year is 75% (the average of 100% and 50%).\n\n**Who will swap protection for ETH in the tokenbuyer?**\n\nBy setting a price in the tokenbuyer that is higher than the current market price on Cozy, the DAO can expect an economically rational third party to take the arbitrage opportunity."},{"blockNumber":17510627,"blockHash":"0x0156f20b647e8ccfdccaf7ffa614a2c6f83726b04c83532cb0eb40ec0ca60659","transactionIndex":76,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xe477975539012361e893a95ce6d2f6311cc3cea930bf149d546b0d0fabc55c47","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":314,"proposer":"0xbc3ed6B537f2980e66f396Fe14210A56ba3f72C4","targets":["0xbc3ed6B537f2980e66f396Fe14210A56ba3f72C4"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":17546627,"endBlock":17582627,"description":"# Retro Fund Voter.wtf\n\n**tl;dr** Retro fund 10 ETH to Wilson Cusack (proposer) for work on Nouns governance client, [voter.wtf](https://www.voter.wtf/).\n___\n*Background*\n*Motivation*\n*Traction*\n*Ask*\n\n## Background\nTwo months ago, I started work on [voter.wtf](https://www.voter.wtf/).

In 2021, Wimbledon reached a global audience of over 500 million viewers, while the French Open and the Australian Open had 350 million and 900 million viewers, respectively (source: Grand Slam Board). This global audience provides a significant opportunity for NounsTennisFam to engage a passionate user base and secure NounsDAO significant exposure before an army of loyal fans.\n\n## Sports on the Blockchain\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, Inc., the global sports market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.3% from 2020 to 2027, driven by increasing participation in sports, the rising popularity of sports leagues, and the growing demand for sports-related merchandise. Although this report does not specifically address tennis, a Nielsen Sports report forecasts tennis viewership to continue growing in the United States, fueled by top players' popularity and the rise of new stars like Coco Gauff. The US Open, in particular, has experienced significant growth, with a 33% increase in average audience per match in 2021 compared to the previous year. This suggests the potential for the sport to continue to grow in popularity and reach new audiences, offering a substantial opportunity for NounsDAO to engage with a large audience eager for innovative solutions like the NounsTennisFam platform.\n\n## Success stories\n\n### Tennis Australia\n\nTennis Australia collaborated with the Australian Open to incorporate blockchain technology and NFTs into the event. The final bounce of winning points was linked to corresponding NFTs known as \"Artballs.\" Fans owning these NFTs won various rewards, such as tickets to the next year's tournament. The Australian Open also utilized the metaverse, creating a replica of the Rod Laver Arena in Decentraland and engaging with millions of users in a Roblox experience. These initiatives led to increased viewership and fan engagement, demonstrating the potential of blockchain technology in sports.\n\n### NBA Top Shot\n\nNBA Top Shot is a blockchain-based platform that allows fans to buy, sell, and trade officially licensed NBA collectible highlights (NFTs). Its success factors include a strategic partnership with the NBA, a user-friendly platform, and scarcity-driven value of collectibles.\n\n### Socios.com\n\nSocios.com is a blockchain-based fan engagement platform for sports teams. Its success factors include partnerships with top-tier football clubs, fan token offerings (FTOs), and voting rights for fans on certain club decisions.\n\nThese examples exhibit incredible potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize fan engagement, sports financing, and brand name recognition.\n\n## Key Benefits of Collaboration\n\n### Team and Experience\n\nBoasting Ivy League graduates, professional athletes, proven entrepreneurs, and Web3 experts, the NounsTennisFam team is prepared to catapult NounsDAO into the professional tennis spotlight as a fresh, inventive, and distinguished new brand.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/mZzdHWfk/Screen-Shot-2023-06-07-at-1-04-23-am.png)\n\n| [Co-founder Borna Ćorić](https://www.atptour.com/en/players/borna-coric/cg80/overview) | [Co-founder & CCO Bruna Ćorić](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruna-%C4%87ori%C4%87-916784b5/) | [Co-founder & CEO Bruno Pliso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-pliso-1a29a6176/) | [Creative Director Nina Turudic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolina-turudic-ab29b4b2/) |\n\n| [Finance & Operations Ivan Turudic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-turudi%C4%87-18657a155/) | [CTO Karlo Brdek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlo-brdek) | [CMO Sven Stanko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sven-stanko-545751ba/) | NFT Advisor, Dapper VP Fran Brajcic | [Web3 Consultant Shan Kumar](http://https://twitter.com/shanicucic96) |\n\n\n# Platform Features and User Experience\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1RNDSMdm/platform.png)\n\nNounsTennisFam platform offers a range of features designed to create a transparent, fair, and sustainable ecosystem to attract and connect tennis pros, new talent, and fans. \n\n1. **Platform & Launchpad:** The platform uses blockchain technology to establish a secure and transparent infrastructure to support emerging tennis talent. The NTF dApp enables fans to sponsor young and underprivileged players through funds generated by launchpad mints and commercial sponsorship deals. \n2. **Player Exclusive Launchpad & Drops**: This feature allows established players and potential professionals to tokenize a portion of their anticipated earnings, providing financial support. The platform offers two types of drops: Professional Drops (seasonal tokens) and Prospect Drops (sponsorship tokens), catering to different stages of a player’s career. \n3. **The Fam Section**: An exclusive content and social networking dashboard for NTF Asset holders, providing access to exclusive content, networking opportunities, and various benefits determined by the athletes. \n4. **Athletes & Valuation**: The platform features verified ATP and WTA players and up-and-coming prospects, with advisory and selection support from Borna’s management agency, Kozmos Holding. Drops are valued individually, with tokens representing a fraction of the total fractionalized prize money. Professional player valuations are based on historical performance data and a proprietary model, while prospect valuations involve negotiations and selection for either a Prospect pool or a Player exclusive drop, guided by the expertise of Kozmos Holding.\n\nTogether, NounsTennisFam and NounsDAO can actively support emerging tennis superstars by addressing one of their most significant challenges–funding, while providing a framework for established professionals to enter the Web3 space through fractionalized earnings. This approach will strengthen our brand and further democratizes the sport of tennis. Additionally, this collaboration will place NounsTennisFam at the forefront of a vast global tennis market, valued at $5.6 billion in 2019 (Source: ITF). Notably, 46% of global tennis fans have a household income of $75,000 or more (Source: ITF), representing a demographic well-suited to become NounsDAO community members.\n\n# Existing Partnerships and Collaborations\n\nNounsTennisFam has already established integral strategic partnerships with tennis academies, professional players, sport management giants, and Web3 projects that enhance the platform’s features and user experience. Our collaborations within the tennis industry allow us to tap into the impressive viewership numbers of events, such as the Wimbledon 2019, with a peak audience of 9.6 million viewers in the UK alone (Source: BBC), and the French Open 2020 final, with a peak audience of 3.3 million viewers in France (Source: SportsPro). \n\nThese partnerships provide credibility and enable NounsTennisFam to engage with tennis fans and connect with Web3 natives through our blockchain partners.

But when an audacious 13-year-old Noun discovers the plot of the ruthless frowns to use an updated version of the Noggles to enslave its citizens, he has to team up with an unlikely band of misfits to save the ones they love.*\n\n**Genre**: Action, Comedy\n\nScript for the delivered Pilot can be found [***here***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fMSljVpvuS8VbHfesNS_D9Z6IFjrNkO1/view)\n\nWe also created a rough outline of how the story progresses through completion.

Build Nouns Bowling as a Lead Title\nNouns Bowling is a new 3D bowling game built with CC0 assets from the [3D Nouns](https://3dnouns.com) and [Noun Sounds](https://nounsounds.wtf) projects. This game is LIVE on the [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nouns-bowling/id1660679079) today!\n\nBowling is popular on **all gaming platforms** and can blaze a trail for publishing multi-platform Nouns games. Bowling is an approachable, universal game and appeals to all age groups.\n\n### 👉 Play Nouns Bowling: [nounsbowling.app](https://nounsbowling.app)\n![Nouns Bowling](https://i.imgur.com/xqmhQNc.jpg)\n\n[![Nouns Bowling](https://i.imgur.com/5TKGiiU.jpg)](https://youtu.be/A-FBNGRYy4A)\n\nWATCH VIDEO: [Nouns Bowling trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-FBNGRYy4A&list=PLQLUWbPbAeHEdkgI9PFPj7lShFrCg_iPI&index=1)\n\n### Here’s what the funding is for:\n- **Core technology** - build key technology for the other games here\n- **3D Art and Animation** - expand the game and boost production values\n- **Metagame** - features to wrap core gameplay, reusable in other games\n- **Teams feature** - adding team competition between Nouns houses\n- **Prizes feature** - adding prize competitions for game nights\n\n⭐ *Includes new 3D bowling alleys for Nouns communities:*\n\n* **Nouns Alley** - the original alley for the OG Nouns\n* **Lil Nouns Lanes** - a big bowling alley for the Lil Nouns\n* **FOODNOUNs Bowl** - tasty environment with an OTG angle\n* **Gnarly Bowl** - a gnarly alley for extreme bowling athletes\n\n---\n\n## Part 2. Establish the Nouns CC0 Gaming Toolkit\nAs we build Nouns Bowling, we'll create the **Nouns CCO Gaming Toolkit**:\n\n* **3D Nouns characters** - game-ready Unity assets based on [3D Nouns](https://3dnouns.com)\n* **2D Nouns characters** - game-ready Unity assets from [Nouns Sprite Sheets](https://nouns.wtf/vote/201)\n* **Famous Characters** - famous Nouns NPC characters with AI features\n* **Nouns 3D environments** - models and other 3D assets \n* **Useful Unity systems** - to help devs build Nouns games quickly\n\n### Competitive Advantage for Nouns\nNo traditional games business would release 3D characters, environments and gaming IP into the public domain. **What if Mario was a CC0 brand?** 🤯\n\n![Nouns 3D Characters in Unity](https://i.imgur.com/6eGYUvg.gif)\n\n🕺 Game-ready **3D Nouns** ready to rock\n\n### ⭐ Including this BONUS item ...\n![Rose Parade Nouns Float](https://i.imgur.com/FVe75yc.jpg)\n\n![Rose Parade Nouns Float](https://i.imgur.com/PdwSIRV.png)\n\n🚧 3D model of the Rose Parade Float - as seen in Nouns Bowling 🚧\n\n### Rose Parade float CC0 asset:\n- Game-ready Unity package with characters and animations\n- FBX assets for use in Blender or other game engines like Unreal\n- Rendered images for use in videos or on websites\n\n⭐ *Just one example of a useful Nouns 3D gaming asset!*\n\n---\n\n## Part 3. Fire Up a Game Publishing Pipeline 🔥\n### Process for prototyping and shipping Nouns games\nCompetition in games is fierce - only the **top games** in each genre survive. Two ways to win: be a top game in an existing genre, or create a **new game genre**. \n\nLots of prototyping, with rounds of cuts, is the method used by savvy game businesses.\n\n### Pipeline Steps\n1. **Proposals** - generate new ideas and proposals\n2. **Prototypes** - build prototypes for web\n3. **Betas** - fund betas for web and iOS\n4. **Ship** - ship top games on web, mobile\n5. **Publish** - take Nouns games to new gaming platforms\n\n![Nouns Publishing Pipeline](https://i.imgur.com/0Z8HLPr.png)\n\nThis game publishing pipeline is designed to deliver a **stream of prototypes** to playtest, while attracting new builders to Nouns. \n\nThis proposal delivers **12 prototypes** and **6 winners** will be pubished as iOS apps.\n\n---\n\n## Part 4. Launch a Nouns gaming website\n### Purpose\n* First place to launch prototypes (early access for NFT holders)\n* Run beta testing before shipping games to mobile\n* Best platform for web3 experiments and innovation\n\n### Playable Prototypes\n\n[![Nouns Game Site](https://i.imgur.com/D7xZuVA.png)](https://nounsgames.wtf)\n\n🕹️ You can play these game prototypes at [**nounsgames.wtf**](https://nounsgames.wtf)\n\n### Future Website\nImagine a web gaming site like [Poki.com](https://poki.com) where ALL games are Nouns games!\n\n### No Gatekeepers\nThese web games will run on **mobile devices in a browser**!\n... this is a solution for **mobile gaming** without App Stores\n\n*NOTE: we **will** also publish iOS apps with advanced features*\n\n---\n\n## Part 5. Publish and Evolve Nouns Games\n![Evolution](https://i.imgur.com/HCODOxx.png)\n\n### Marketing and Evolution\nThe marketing fund (24 ETH) will be used to onboard new players to Nouns through games, while providing insight into customer preferences.\n\nGaming metrics - engagement and retention - help make decisions on:\n\n* Which prototypes to fund\n* When a beta is ready to ship\n* When to scale up advertising\n\nRound by round, games evolve, and small experiments guide the way.\n\nEvolution rules.\n\n---\n\n# Discord Strategy\n\n## Provide games for existing Nouns communities\n* Web games are easy to decentralize and customize for communities\n* Our standard web build has Daily high scores - perfect for prizes\n* Each game we build is designed for one or more communities\n\n## Build a new Discord for game devs\n\nDiscord is the best place for:\n* Onboarding game devs to Nouns\n* Trying new game prototypes\n* Review of gaming metrics\n* Brainstorming new game concepts\n* Experimenting with new technology like AR\n\n#### 👉 Join the [Nouns Games Discord](https://discord.gg/Ez3KnkrrVk) server\n\n---\n\n# Design Philosophy\n\n## Building Apps for the Whole World\n\nThe [Nouns Virtuous Cycle](https://medium.com/@punk4156/the-nouns-virtuous-cycle-95586bb9c7c9) calls for \"consumer apps the whole world wants to use\"\n\n![Nouns Virtuous Cycle](https://i.imgur.com/yh7H6BX.jpg)\n\nDid punk4156 foresee a gaming future? 🤔\n#### 🌎 *The whole world wants to use Nouns games ...* 🕹️😺\n\n### Games are consumer apps ...\n* Played across all gaming devices and age groups\n* Games are played by **3 billion people** worldwide\n* **Casual games** play to the largest audience\n\n### Simple games are the most universal ...\nHere are 5 genres of game with broad appeal\n* 2D Puzzle games\n* 2D Platform Hopper games\n* 3D Kart driving games\n* 3D Sports titles (think Wii Sports)\n* Simple multiplayer games (for communities)\n\n\n### Web games on mobile are the new frontier ...\n\n[![Alps Snowboarding](https://i.imgur.com/qlc8ieW.gif)](https://nounsgames.wtf/snowboarding)\n\n👉 *[3D snowboarding](https://nounsgames.wtf/snowboarding) runs in Safari on iPhone!*\n\n---\n\n# Budget\n### Summary\n\n* Gaming Website - **20 ETH**\n* Game Production - **155 ETH**\n* Marketing Fund - **24 ETH**\n\n## 💰 199 ETH Total\n\n---\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n### Gaming Website - 20 ETH\n* Design, build and launch the [**nounsgames.wtf**](https://nounsgames.wtf) gaming website\n* Publish web games and prototypes for playtesting\n* Prepare web games for publishing across the Nouniverse\n\n### Nouns Bowling - 35 ETH\n![Bowling Budget](https://i.imgur.com/NGr70PB.png)\n\n### 5 New Games - 100 ETH\nDesigned with **specific Nouns communities** in mind\n![Games Budget Table](https://i.imgur.com/nNUTAts.png)\n\n### 6 New Prototypes - 10 ETH\n* Establish a fund for prototyping new web games\n* Finding new **blue ocean mechanics** is one goal\n* Testing new **game development talent** is another\n\n### Nouns CC0 Unity Gaming Toolkit - 10 ETH\n* Nouns 3D Characters for Unity game developers\n* Nouns 3D Environments for use across Unity games\n* Rose Parade Float CC0 model for community projects\n* Useful Unity systems to quickly add Nouns to games\n* Deliver as a FREE Unity Asset Store package\n\n### Marketing Fund - 24 ETH\nRun measurable advertising experiments to inform design\n* Small paid advertising experiments bring in new players\n* Campaign results help inform the game design process\n* Web game metrics help select the games to ship as iOS apps\n\n### Budget Details\nWe are asking for a total of **199 ETH**\n\n* Art - **52.5 ETH**\n* Design - **17.5 ETH**\n* Engineering - **105 ETH**\n* Marketing - **24 ETH**\n\n### Multi-Sig & Transactions\nUpon successfully passing the prop, **199 ETH** will be sent to a 6 person multi-sig requiring 3 signatures for each send:\n\n1. modrovsky\n2.

No.\nThere will be no DAO for this project. Here's why:\n* There are a LOT of Nouns DAOs, let's build games for those\n* Game selection by DAO vote may not be the best option\n* Better to keep freedom for individual games to have DAOs\n\n### What about running ads in the games?\nRunning annoying ads between levels ruins a lot of good games. But **rewarded ads** and **sponsorships** can work. In-game ads can also **promote other Nouns projects**.\n\nRunning video ads featuring Nouns **in other people's games** is one advertising strategy. Nouns get video views AND game installs.\n\n### What about Tokens and Play-to-Earn?\n**Hot take:** Nouns games should AVOID play-to-earn cryptocurrency models. Gone wrong, they can do more damage to the Nouns brand than good. We don't plan on issuing a token or using play-to-earn tokenomics.\n\n---\n\n# Collabs\n### Games play well with other Nouns projects ...\nDecentralizing games across communities through collabs. This is big.\n\n![Collabs](https://i.imgur.com/zkWUEuI.jpg)\n\n# Future Proposals\n\nObjective is to bring **ambitious gaming proposals** to NounsDAO, for example:\n\n**Games Meets Toys**\nFunding to connect games and toys, loading toys into games, AR features\n\n**Collabs with other Nouns Projects**\nGames x Nouns opens up new opportunities for Nouns communities\n\n**Publishing Games to PC and Consoles**\nPublish games for Mac, PC, Steam, Epic, and consoles (hello Nintendo)\n\n**Game Dev Hackathons**\nFunding for hackathons to create new prototypes and web games\n\n**Scaling Up Nouns Proliferation with Games**\nOnboarding people to Nouns with games, by scaling up successful advertising experiments. Proliferation on demand, to desired audiences, with measurable ROI.\n\n---\n\n# Outcome\n\n### ✅ Nouns Communities get Powered Up\nDecentralized web games for Nouns communities unlock new business models\n\n### ✅ Nouns Solves its Game Funding Problem\nNouns Game Publisher helps NounsDAO make smart investments in games\n\n### ✅ Indie Game Developers Flock to Nouns\nGame publishing pipeline and CC0 toolkit attracts new talent to Nouns\n\n### ✅ Games Get Less Expensive to Market\nA network of Nouns games is less expensive to advertise.

Our team has been hard at work programming Nerman's various bots and libraries since then. Check out [nerman.wtf](https://nerman.wtf) for a summary of the project and links to the various code repositories.\n\nIn this proposal we focus our efforts on Nerman.js ([GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman.js), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nerman)), and Nounish feeds using our Discord bot ([GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman)).\n\n---\n\n## NERMAN.JS - NOUNS SDK\n\n---\n\nNerman.js provides simple type-safe access to Nouns DAO contract events, as well as custom events such as Noun O'Clock. The user provides a JSON-RPC url and connects directly to an Ethereum node without any further 3rd party hosted services.\n\nYou can install Nerman.js with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nerman)\n\n**DEMO - NOUN O'CLOCK**\n\n``` typescript\nimport * as nerman from \"nerman\";\n\nconst Nouns = new nerman.Nouns( JSON_RPC_API_URL );\n\nNouns.on(\"AuctionEnd\", (data : nerman.EventData.AuctionEnd) => {\n    \n    // It's Noun O'Clock, do stuff here!!\n\n});\n```\n\nFor more code examples see the ReadMe in [GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman.js). Nerman.js currently supports listening to Nouns DAO events such as auction creation, auction bids, proposal creation, dao votes, Noun creation, Noun transfer, delegation changes, and more. We also launched support for [Nouns Nymz](https://nouns.nymz.xyz/) and have a live feed posting in a Nouns community Discord.\n\n**THE FUTURE**\n\nNerman.js will provide and maintain access to events across the Nouniverse:\n\n- Nouns DAO events across all contracts, including DAO updates (v3) and DAO tools (token buyer)\n- Various events from Nounish projects and tools like Prop House, Nouns Nymz, Federation, Agora, etc. \n- Contract events from Nounish DAOs (Lil Nouns, Gnars, Builder DAO)\n\nNerman.js will index on-chain Nouns data:\n\n- Pre-indexed Nouns data included with library for instant access\n- Manually run the indexer yourself for verification\n- This indexed data allows Nerman to offer more complicated analysis of the data, including reporting behavior of voters, bidders, vote participation rates, etc.\n\nNerman.js will be a canonical source of knowledge about the Nouniverse:\n\n- Our extensive, SEO optimized documentation will help people figure out what Nouns contracts and projects exist and how to best interact with them. Our resources will be a useful starting point for anyone developing in Nouns.\n\n\n---\n\n## DISCORD BOT - NOUNISH FEEDS\n\n---\n\nNerman offers customizable Nounish event feeds for Discord channels, displaying formatted embeds with the main Nouns DAO contract events from Nerman.js. Users can configure which events to display in a channel with a simple command.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyX8b1U_3.jpg)\n\n**CURRENT NOUNISH FEEDS**\n\n- **Agora Discord**\n  Auction and DAO Proposal events in #gov-updates channel\n- **A Nouns Community Discord**\n  Auction and Proposal events in #general channel\n  Nouns Nymz posts in #nouns-nymz\n- **Nouncil**\n  Auctions, Proposals, Token Transfers in Feeds Section\n  Proposal votes and status changes posted in appropriate Prop threads in #nouncil-votes\n\n  \n\n**THE FUTURE**\n\nWe will add all Nerman.js events as we create them, allowing easy Discord notifications from Prop House, Federation, other Nounish DAO's, and anywhere else we can get event feeds from. We will also experiment with different feed ideas using the events we have, for instance creating a feed that only displays Nouns DAO votes with 0 vote weight as an informal on-chain chat.\n\nWe will also develop a way for automated Nouns DAO prop discussions using forums, where a new thread is automatically created for each proposal.\n\n---\n\n## TERMS\n\n---\n\n- funding for the team to continue developing Nerman up to Dec 31, 2023. \n- all code will be open source and released under a permissive license (such as MIT).\n\n---\n\n## TRANSACTION\n\n---\n\n**Total Budget: 93 Ξ**\nJoel Cares (part time) and a team of 2 devs (full time)\n\n**Transaction**\n93 ETH streamed to 0x09b68020Fb9691C2c20687631EDCF16fdFCba277"},{"blockNumber":17584805,"blockHash":"0x89f97fcfcfecb80c91be2a527f5a23df66e0a2c4031baea020b453e364cf09d4","transactionIndex":103,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x4e4e2e62babff8f8112ba9f3c8e0f87b2db1392a5d6895bf4663741a18b3a267","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":320,"proposer":"0x29c5dad7E34d0A27d6F65a0A7E07E4d03Dcd68c8","targets":["0xae7ab96520DE3A18E5e111B5EaAb095312D7fE84","0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0","0xBA12222222228d8Ba445958a75a0704d566BF2C8","0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0","0xE0Ca4DAc40d44D737f0d02B1F2B2D969731eCda9"],"signatures":["approve(address,uint256)","wrap(uint256)","setRelayerApproval(address,address,bool)","approve(address,uint256)","longTermSwap(address,address,uint256,uint256,uint256,address)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000007f39c581f595b53c5cb19bd0b3f8da6c935e2ca000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002086ac351052600000","0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002086ac351052600000","0x0000000000000000000000000bc3807ec262cb779b38d65b38158acc3bfede10000000000000000000000000e0ca4dac40d44d737f0d02b1f2b2d969731ecda90000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001","0x000000000000000000000000ba12222222228d8ba445958a75a0704d566bf2c800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001b1ae4d6e2ef500000","0x0000000000000000000000007f39c581f595b53c5cb19bd0b3f8da6c935e2ca0000000000000000000000000ae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001b1ae4d6e2ef50000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a800000000000000000000000029c5dad7e34d0a27d6f65a0a7e07e4d03dcd68c8"],"startBlock":17620805,"endBlock":17656805,"description":"# Treasury Diversification: Swap 500 wstETH -> rETH via TWAMM\n\n### tldr;\n\nThere’s been interest in diversifying [Nouns DAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10), specifically `stETH => rETH`, and we have built a tool that’s tailor-made to help execute these trades: *TWAMM.* The trade will be executed completely on-chain, transparently with very low fees and minimal gas costs. \n\nThe first trade will be for $1M, and after that completes successfully, a larger $14M trade will be proposed.\n\n## **Background**\n\nTWAMM is a concept introduced by [Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/07/twamm) in July 2021. \"It works by breaking long-term orders into infinitely many infinitely small pieces and executing them against an embedded constant-product AMM smoothly over time.\" \n\nAn on-chain AMM protocol to enable large token swaps is essential to increase DeFi adoption and anti-fragility. Some interesting use cases for TWAMMs include [treasury diversification](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1502177286170185735)*,* [whale liquidations](https://twitter.com/solendprotocol/status/1538553654575214592)*,* [peg maintenance](https://www.notion.so/fd88cb37208d4b0f9abaca4e276f9ddd?pvs=21)*, etc*.\n\nWe have been researching and developing TWAMMs since November 2021 and recently launched our protocol: [CronFi TWAMM](https://twitter.com/cronfinance/status/1645802789006876672). The code has been audited by SpearbitDAO, open-sourced, and verified on Etherscan. Considerable detail about the protocol is presented on the [docs page](https://docs.cronfi.com/twamm/).\n\n## **Product Design & Incentives**\n\n- AMM: we built our TWAMM as a custom pool on top of Balancer V2 Vault leveraging the *security, liquidity, flexibility, and gas advantages* of Balancer. Additionally, Balancer has become a Schelling point for protocols that want to leverage their AMM, thus creating network effects & composability advantages.\n- Traders: as a long-term trader (Nouns DAO), you only have to pay gas for starting, canceling, or withdrawing proceeds from your order. All the other sub-orders of the DCA are done virtually and cost the Nouns DAO no gas fees. Virtual orders are only written on-chain when the next user interacts with the protocol (generally an arbitrageur).\n- Arbitrageurs: as seen on other AMMs like Uniswap, arbitrageurs are important to keep the price of the assets in line with external venues. Arbitrageurs are critical for TWAMMs because trade sizes are significantly larger and last for multiple blocks. Therefore we have built and partnered with dedicated arbitrageurs (BloXRoute) to ensure pools are arbitraged frequently to ensure Nouns DAO gets the best swap return.\n- Liquidity: there will be a minimum of $30k liquidity in the pools and we expect that to reach between $50-100k in liquidity before the trade executes. TWAMMs are extremely capital efficient given that the trades are split across multiple blocks and arbitrageurs are consistently bringing new liquidity back to the system to correct price deviations — simulation details below illustrate these efficiencies and swap performance.\n\n## **Advantages**\n\n- Low fees: wstETH/rETH is a stable pair and long-term swappers pay a one-time **0.03% fee.**\n- Fully on-chain: zero dependencies on off-chain services, oracles, compute etc.\n- Flexible: issue, withdraw, and cancel orders with ease.\n    - Example new order: `sell 7_500 stETH for rETH in 100_000 blocks` ~roughly 2 weeks\n    - Helpful periphery contract to issue orders\n- Full control of orders and assets: non-custodial, cancellable, and withdraw proceeds at any time.\n- Withdraw multiple times: users can withdraw once at the end, or every set number of blocks – they just pay gas fees.\n- DCA over 1000’s of blocks gas-free: Nouns DAO would only pay gas for starting and ending suborders; arbitrageurs pay for placing suborders on-chain.\n- Analytics: we will have an analytics dashboard that shows how the order is being filled so the DAO can monitor the trade. There will also be a post-trade analysis and report.\n- Monitoring: we will be actively monitoring the trade as the `delegate` to ensure the order is being filled at a reasonable price. In case the trade escapes a reasonable threshold, we will cancel the trade on behalf of the DAO, refunding proceeds and the remaining unsold portion of the order to the Nouns DAO wallet.\n\n## **Risks**\n\n- Smart contract:\n    - Fully audited: see SpearbitDAO report [here](https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/blob/master/pdfs/CronFinance-Spearbit-Security-Review.pdf).\n    - Hack Risks: built on Balancer V2 Vaults which have been battle-tested for 2+ years.\n    - Bricked Pools: we’ve done extensive research and mitigations for gas, order DDoS, numerical underflows, incorrect TWAMM parameters etc – more info here: [0slippage](https://mirror.xyz/0slippage.eth).\n    - Loss of Funds: open-source code, audited, verified, non-custodial, users in full control of funds, trade happens over multiple blocks so it can be canceled at any time by the user.\n    - Malicious Pool Admin: all pool administrators can do is pause the pool or change fees at which point Nouns DAO can cancel and withdraw their funds.\n- Lack of Arbitrage: we have built a flash swap arbitrage bot and also teamed up with BloXroute to provide a dedicated arbitrage service.\n- Poor Execution: orders are cancellable at any time i.e if the price escapes preferred bounds restart the order at another time. Also, DCA is generally a better strategy than spot purchase for large orders.\n- Information Leakage: this is not a big concern for a stable pair like wstETH/rETH which are like assets and have deep liquidity pools.\n- MEV/Sandwich Attacks: orders are broken into small pieces and thus the benefit of front/back running orders is minimal – see the Paradigm paper for further details.\n\n## **Competition**\n\nHere are the alternatives and how they stack up against TWAMM. Note this isn’t a comprehensive list, but a short summary.\n\n- Gnosis Auction:\n    - Pros: well-tested technology\n    - Cons: reliant on well-funded keepers, minimum buy lots, price upside capped, infrastructure overhead, limited timeframe, poor execution vs DCA over long periods.\n- Manual DCA:\n    - Pros: can execute it today\n    - Cons: need to write a smart contract or fat finger mistakes, fees for each sub-order, gas costs of sub-orders, limited # of sub-orders\n- DEX:\n    - Pros: complete trade in a single block\n    - Cons: poor liquidity, slippage, MEV attack vectors\n- Aggregators\n    - Pros: access to liquidity, completes trade quickly\n    - Cons: not on-chain, MEV attack vectors, slippage\n- OTC:\n    - Pros: limit orders and other novel trade execution algorithms\n    - Cons: off-chain, opaque, high fees, custodial, KYC, regulations, etc\n\n## Trade Simulations\n\nHere are the simulation results for the trade and expected returns. The initial trade is to show Nouns DAO the power of the protocol and ensure everything works as expected. This simulation is an approximation and results might vary based on liquidity, prices, volatility, etc. We will be monitoring the trade to ensure the trade fills won’t deviate drastically from the expected outcome. \n\n*NOTE*: this is a full contract simulation between a Balancer pool and our contract, using a fixed wstETH:rETH price in the balancer pool, fixed gas units, and fixed USD exchange rates. The simulation is executed with the actual contracts, with certain parameters held constant to evaluate the effect of liquidity and arbitrage frequency on swap performance.\n\n### $1M trade with $100k liquidity: 1.327% slippage\n\n![$1M Trade](https://file.notion.so/f/s/cc37a59f-9774-4859-a61c-69f8ee99fc0f/Untitled.png?id=af6d81b7-0b73-459b-bb0d-c6cafd2546d8&table=block&spaceId=7e9c2097-8472-4264-8933-88a90befa953&expirationTimestamp=1688119200000&signature=-LrcBvyt3f3UR6P-R3vrIOmejvImtapnsevhYmY6-yM&downloadName=Untitled.png)\n\nLPs make **1.537% ($1537)** from fees in a week, if you’re interested in adding liquidity to the pool to earn fees, you can add liquidity here: [wstETH <> rETH TWAMM Pool](https://www.app.cronfi.com/pools/0x6910C4e32D425a834Fb61e983C8083a84b0EBd01).

I think this is a fun, sort of grassroots, small-is-big proliferation effort from a team that is highly committed to Nouns and has done quality work in the past.*\n \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkFD93zdn.jpg)\n### TL;DR\n- We propose to launch a stamp-collecting campaign to nounify Korea.\n- Our primary objective is to establish Nouns as a prominent pop culture brand.\n- By collaborating with coffee shops and utilizing Nouns' CC0 content, we can maximize Nouns' exposure and provide incentives for fans.\n- To achieve this, we kindly request $65,000 or around $4,600 per location to promote nouns at 10+ coffee shops, 2 retail stores, and 2 art galleries over the next three months.\n\n### Description\nWe have observed the success of Nouns' flywheel in Brazil, China, Japan, and other communities. We propose to launch activation campaign in Korea in collaboration with ten authentic coffee shops. This campaign aims to educate people about nouns and engage them in the process. Participants will collect noggle-stamps and have the chance to earn stylish nounish t-shirts as rewards.\n\nOur team firmly believes in our energy and talent to establish Nouns as a prominent pop culture brand in Korea. The campaign will span three months, during which people will receive noggle-stamps with their coffee purchases. Once they collect 10 stamps, they can exchange a coupon card for a nounish t-shirt.\n\nTo ensure widespread exposure, all coffee shops will display posters, t-shirts, and magazines featuring on-chain proposals. Furthermore, these t-shirts will be available for purchase at retail stores and art galleries. We are committed to creating high-quality t-shirts using nounish cc0 content, with additional approval from the artists involved.\n\nFor the successful activation of the nouns community in Korea and the promotion of Nouns in 10+ locations over three months, we kindly request $65,000 in funding.\n\n### The stamp collection campaign\n![](https://i.imgur.com/51HGjJe.jpg)\n\nThe campaign will focus on creating visibility, engaging local community, and establishing a loyal fan base. The coffee shops will become a place for people to gather and learn about nouns through arts on t-shirts and information in magazines.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1e0gbXuh.png)\n\nCoupon cards featuring nouns will be distributed at the coffee shops' counters. We anticipate each coffee shop to distribute around 50-30 coupon cards daily, totaling approximately 27,000 cards throughout the campaign. In our focused campaign, we will give out special coupon cards that need only 2 stamps to people who are interested in blockchain and NFTs through our network of friends.\n\n### T-shirts\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByDeX5Md3.jpg)\n\nT-shirts will be placed in highly visible areas at coffee shops. We'll use Nouns' cc0 content to create a beautiful collection of t-shirts. Our goal is to pleasantly surprise everyone with the quality and spirit of nounish artworks. These t-shirts will be made from scratch specifically for this campaign from high-quality materials and tailored in various styles for both men and women. Each label and tag will feature Noggles and links to Noun's homepage and Twitter account.\n\nWe will strategically strive to get the t-shirts in the hands of pop stars, actors, musicians, and models.\n\nThe t-shirts will be the same as those for prop173, 'Sail in NY,' that received praise from the community for their quality.\n\n### NOUNS.WTF magazine\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkFD93zdn.jpg)\n\nWe propose creating a NOUNS.WTF magazine as a powerful marketing and storytelling tool to convey the campaign's message. The magazine will be cost-effective to design using Canva templates and nounish CC0 content. The magazines will be distributed at partner coffee shops and serve as a guide to NounsDAO.\n\nThe magazine will feature articles about: \n- campaign\n- t-shirt collection\n- top on-chain proposals\n- nounish subdaos\n- overview of government clients.\n- We invite individuals and subdaos to contribute to the magazine's creation. Contact us on Twitter to publish an article or a post ([Nouns Seoul](https://twitter.com/nounsseoul)).\n\n### Coffee shops and other partner properties\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1Zj0T5u3.jpg)\n\nWe are going to collaborate with authentic coffee shops around Seoul. Here are the links to coffee shops located in popular areas such as [Jeongno](https://www.instagram.com/cha.teul/), [Itaewon](https://www.instagram.com/theroyalfad/), and [Sinsa](https://www.instagram.com/minoscoffeecult/). Additionally, we are going to sell t-shirts at popular [Fashion and lifestyle](https://www.instagram.com/niceweather.seoul/) goods stores and [art galleries](https://www.instagram.com/print_bakery/).\n\nAs of now, we onboarded three coffee shops, one retail store, and one art gallery. We can rest of the partner properties recruited in no time.\n\n### Why Korea\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJUNQsvw2.jpg)\n\nKorea is known for its collection of cool nounish items, ranging from sailboats, resin toys, and children's books to motorcycles. In line with this, our goal is to unite and provide a firsthand experience to an increasing number of Nouns' fans. We believe that the timing is ideal to launch a nounish campaign, aiming to showcase the beautiful aspects of Nouns' art, culture, and governance. This initiative will not only attract a larger base of devoted fans but also facilitate the discovery of new nounish memes and contribute to the advancement of nounish culture.\n\n### Timeline\nThe campaign is scheduled to commence in July and continue until October. The team estimates that it will require approximately 3-4 weeks to complete all the necessary preparations.\n1 week - legal matters\n1 week - coffee shop recruitment\n1 week - decorations/logistics\n3 weeks - manufacture 2,000 t-shirts\n3 weeks - design and print NOUNS.WTF magazine\n\n### The team\n1. **[Fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)** t-shirts manufacturing and distribution\n2. **[Morph](https://www.instagram.com/morphmgmt/)** - legal matters and work with coffee shops.\n3. **[Jhee](https://twitter.com/jheeart_nft)** NOUNS.WTF magazine\n4. **[Duckhead](https://twitter.com/_duckhead)** coffee shops decorations\n\n### Budget\n$35,000 - manufacture 2,000 t-shirts (custom tags with noggles, different styles, artwork press, packaging)\n$10,000 - coffee shops' rental fees (10 coffee shops, 3 months, $330 per month)\n$4,000 - NOUNS.WTF magazine design and printing\n$2,500 - logistics & storage (Ex. 100 t-shirts weight 22 kg or 48 pounds)\n$2,500 - legal, tax, signing contracts with coffee shops, outsourcing  company's fees to conduct business etc\n$3,000 - decorations $300 per coffee shop (10 t-shirt stands, 100 posters, 10 noggle stamps, 27,000 coupon cards, and others)\n$2,000 - photo & video production to document progress and share on SNS\n$6,000 - team's compensation.

We are seeking funding to expand our actions in 3 complementary strategic directions:\n\n1. New regions 📍\n2. Proper marketing in Brazil 🇧🇷\n3. New product categories 👀   \n\n**1) New regions 📍**    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/4iKllzi.png)\nNarcose is already part of a network of regular collaborative breweries, through which it markets its beers in the US and Europe. We will take Public Good Beer to these markets, also integrating them into our onboarding ecosystem and turning them into real Nouns builders.\n\nWe are asking for 4500 USDC amount, enough for label printing, marketing material, initial sample distribution (est. 500 cans of beer), and post-production FOR EACH of our partners:\n\nStillwater Brewery (Seattle) 🇺🇸\nAgainst the Grain (Kentucky) 🇺🇸\nWooden Ship (Minneapolis) 🇺🇸\nBrewski (Sweden) 🇸🇪\nBierol (Austria) 🇦🇹\nCanil (Portugal) 🇵🇹\n\nNote that the goal is to catalyst a collaborative beer that will be sold as part of the brewery’s portfolio, not to distribute it only at a single event. The funding is an incentive to kickstart production and marketing and involves a commitment from the brewery.\n\n**BUDGET: 6x 4500 = 27000 USDC**   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jvG8dTb.png)\n**2) Proper marketing in Brazil 🇧🇷**\n\nInternational expansion will not be instantaneous, as it demands a free schedule in the industry. In this period, we take advantage of the existing inventory of over 3000 cans produced.\n\nDespite the success of Phase 1, we believe we haven’t reached full IRL proliferation potential for such a pioneer project. We had 0.5 ETH for everything (sub 300 cans, and very short-scale marketing activation). Thus, the proposed expansion would bring the deserved impact and tons of resources for further promotion of the Nouniverse.\n\nThe next 2 biggest crypto weeks in Brazil happen in August (during NFTRio) and September (Blockchain Rio, which connected the Brazilian Nouns community IRL for the first time). We are asking 4500 USDC for each week to make a big impact at main and side events, including:\n\n* Public Good Beer distribution\n* Marketing materials (shirts, stickers, temporary tattoos)\n* Activations (POAP distribution, treasure hunts, giveaways)\n* Professional quality media production\n* We are asking for 4500 USDC for each week.\n\n**BUDGET: 2x 4500 = 9000 USDC**   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DbzkhNr.gif)\n**3) New product categories 👀**\n\nBeyond beer, we have the opportunity to extend the portfolio to two synergic brands/categories:\n\na) BBQ sauces - for the weekly beer-fueled barbecues we do all around Brazil; and\nb) Sunscreen - for our 7637 km of coastline, full of bikinis, surf stars and sunglasses ⌐◨-◨\n\nWe would like to allocate a total budget of 5000 USDC to work this as the project progresses. Alongside with this we also have the coordination and maintenance of the activities during period of 6 months at a cost of 6000 USDC.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p6Hr6hb.png)\n\n**BUDGET: 11000 USDC**   \n\n**TEAM**\n\nfabioseva.eth\njp.⌐◨-◨\n\nWe are very excited to keep spreading the CC0 culture and bringing companies on board with us.

Don’t forget to follow [@PublicGoodBeer](https://twitter.com/publicgoodbeer) on Twitter for all the latest updates.

It's incredibly satisfying to witness a tangible representation of the Public Goods brand. With its CC0 recipe, distinctive branding, and collaboration with various breweries, this project stands out as an innovative venture that extends the reach of the meme.

This collaboration would provide proliferation into a new market and a connection between two of the fastest growing web3 brands, including content proliferation during launch.\n\n**About Pudgy Penguins**\n\n***Toy launch*** – Pudgy Penguins recently launched our Shark Collectible on NTWRK and sold out 150 pieces in under 3 seconds at $249 a piece. It was one of NTWRKS fastest sales on record. NTWRK features some of the most passionate physical collectors in the world and we believe exposing the Nouns brand on their platform will be a huge step forward. **On Ebay, Pudgy Sharks have resold for $750 - $1,250 a piece**.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkZgwLPdn.png)\n\nView Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz's unboxing of \"Shark Suit\" collectible here: https://twitter.com/pudgypenguins/status/1671987835518480386?s=20\n\nThe team also recently attended the Licensing Show highlighting all the different toy lines we are producing. See a recap video here: https://twitter.com/LucaNetz/status/1672343978958569474?s=20\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJwfqVY_n.png)\n\n\nThe Nouns version of this collectible would have a similar digital connection via the rfid chip with provenance demonstrated on the blockchain in the ethos of NounsDAO. It would come with its own custom box, integrated story, and collectible card, optimizing for the best collector experience possible.\n\n---\n\n**Why Nouns?**\n\nNouns has been the staple for decentralized brand building and we see it as the only real Web3 brand outside of Pudgy Penguins. We want to align the two best Web3 brands and IP to create a historic moment for the traditional world.\n\nDue to the cc0 nature of NounsDAO IP, Pudgy Penguins could move forward without the DAO's approval but we want this to be an official collaboration, bringing the Huddle into the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n\n**The Benefit to NounsDAO**\n\nThe extensive proliferation we had with our recent toy launch will be repeated with this launch, including extensive social media coverage, press coverage, marketing efforts from NTWRK and Pudgy Penguins through traditional channels (posters, magazines, email blasts, product seedings, etc) will bring millions of impressions to the Nouns brand.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkXXTVFd3.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk84TEF_h.png)\n\n**⌐◨-◨ x Pudgy Penguins Launch Plan**\n\nWe are proposing to create 499 Red Penguins and 499 Blue Penguins with the matching Nouns glasses. We would retail it for $299 and we would have a 10 total Penguins within the lot that would feature a pair of Gold glasses. The gold glasses figures will be treated as a golden ticket and will be randomly given to 10 lucky purchasers. We want to add gold plating to these gold glasses to make the value proposition even more special. \n\nWe expect this collectible to be ready for launch four months after passage of this proposal, in time for the holidays. Expected launch date is 12/08/2023. \n\n---\n**Joining NounsDAO**\n\nIn addition to the extensive proliferation that will result from this collaboration, we want the Huddle will join NounsDAO! A percentage of profit from the sale of this ⌐◨-◨ x Pudgy Penguins toy line will be put towards buying a Noun on auction. We'll be requesting an igloo and will utilize the new NounScout.wtf site when ready to put in the request.\n\n**Team**\n\nThe Pudgy Penguins team is a team of elite brand builders and marketers.

Now, these have been addressed by introducing a flexible fund for activities and building a dedicated in-house team.\n- **Next Steps**:\n    - **Collaborations**: Partner with world known organizations to enhance Mucho Love's reach and impact.\n    - **Empowerment**: Members are provided autonomy to initiate and lead impactful projects.\n    - **Full-Time Media Team**: A dedicated team built to nurture Mucho Love's growth and ensure consistent quality content.\n- **Content Strategy**: Broadening content types to include short videos, impact leaders podcast interviews, member's story clips, photographic documentation, and long-format videos for diverse engagement.\n- **Future Direction**: Mucho Love aims to go global with new partnerships, engage larger businesses, and host large-scale activities to promote the Nouns brand and secure funding.\n-  **Sustainability**: As Mucho Love continues to expand, we're on track to achieve self-sustainability through leverage provided by content creation, collaborations, sponsorships, and Nouns-powered fundraising events by mid 2024.\n- **Budget**: \n    - Requesting 159,100 USDC for social impact activations, collaborations, operations, and content team. \n    - 1 Noun for admin compensation.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hykw3QYDn.png)\n\n### **WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY BUILDING**  \n- **At Mucho Love, we're on a mission to make Nouns a symbol of greatness**. Drawing inspiration from MrBeast's model, we use acts of kindness to weave compelling narratives that inspire and captivate. \n    - Each act not only fosters positive change, but it also sparks interest, paving the way for greater collaborations. \n    - Through our partnerships with businesses and institutions, we are building a dynamic community, all fuelled by the positivity and power of Nouns.\n- Each project we embark on gives rise to a unique, life-altering story. From the organizations we work with to the communities we impact, every tale stands as testament to the transformative power of Nouns.\n    - Mucho Love isn't just a platform for good deeds; we're spearheading a movement. \n    - We're not just telling stories, we're changing lives, one narrative at a time.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1Bq7MMun.jpg)\n\n\n### **OUR NEXT BIG STEPS** \nWe're set to boost our impact and carry Nouns & Mucho Love further with three significant strides:\n- **COLLABORATIONS**: To broaden Mucho Love's reach and enhance our influence, we are strategically partnering with some of the largest institutions and organizations in the world. \n    - By joining forces, we can collectively reach a larger audience, build stronger relationships, and make a profound difference to the communities we serve. \n- **FULL-TIME MEDIA TEAM**: Recognizing the value of commitment and passion, we’ve established a dedicated, full-time media team.\n    - We've made the strategic choice to prioritize full-time, dedicated individuals over part-time talent, no matter how skilled.\n- **EMPOWERING CONTRIBUTORS**: A key focus for us is the empowerment of our volunteers and members, providing them with the autonomy to take charge of their own activations. \n    - This empowerment strengthens ownership, responsibility, and engagement, fueling passion for our mission while cultivating a culture of innovation and problem-solving. \n\n### **WORLD-CLASS COLLABORATORS** \nThrough our past work, **the ⌐◨-◨'s have become a symbol of doing good**. This has helped us connect with world-class partners.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkI6OwQD3.png)\n\nIf you don't know what **TECHO** does, **MrBeast** recently partnered with them in one of his latest philanthropy videos.

We're looking at creating an international collaboration network.\n- **Business Partnerships**: Businesses are keen on content that promotes their brand positively. We're exploring mutual beneficial partnerships to generate large-scale impact.\n- **Event-based Fundraising**: We're considering launching annual events, like a Nouns Music Festival or a Nouns Fundraising Run. These events can support Mucho Love significantly while building community and Nouns brand awareness.\n- **Brand and Impact Events**: We plan to set up large events that will both promote the Nouns brand and generate revenue for Mucho Love's operations.\n- **Sustainability Forecast**: We aim for Mucho Love to be self-sustainable by mid-2024. We're looking at attracting more partnerships, sponsorships, and using Nouns-powered events for fundraising.\n\n### **IMPACT & GROWTH**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ2EuCvw3.png)\n### **PROBLEMS FACED**\nOver the past 10 months, we've overcome many challenges and improved our methods.\n- **Outsourcing Content Team**: We outsourced our content team, which, despite its benefits, led to notable challenges, including a limited understanding of the Nouns and Mucho Love ethos, content inconsistency, and loss of the 'magic' due to rotating personnel and equipment changes. \n    - The solution? We're now building a dedicated, full-time team that is deeply invested in our mission and platform's growth.\n- **Pre-setting all Activities & Funds**: We felt tied to our initial plans, even when other exciting possibilities appeared. \n    - Our solution is to keep some of our fund flexible. This way, we can jump on fresh opportunities that align with our mission, making our operations more adaptable and responsive.\n\n### **CONTENT STRATEGY**\nOur activations serve as a content launchpad. We will create:\n- **Short Videos**: Bite-sized activation outcome and goal overviews.\n- **Impact Leaders Podcast Interviews**: In-depth dialogues with our activation leaders.\n- **Member’s Story Clips**: Member reflections on our activities.\n- **Photographic Documentation**: Capturing the essence of each activity.\n- **Long-Format Videos**: Documenting each activation’s journey, from planning to reflection.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy9yv0wP3.png)\n### **DISTRIBUTION** \nOur collaborations with major entities expand our content's reach.\n- Their networks become extensions of ours, broadening our impact stories. In return, they get to highlight their good deeds by sharing our content. \n    - We generate and share captivating content across Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube, attracting diverse audiences with our purpose and uplifting tales. \n- The good we do spurs further content creation, establishing a growth cycle. \n    - Each partnership amplifies our reach and demonstrates the positive power of Nouns.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1g8Krw_2.png)\n\n### BUDGET \n\n### **MUCHO LOVE LED ACTIVATIONS** - 64,100 USDC\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1f55eQK3.png)\n\n\n### **COLLABORATIVE ACTIVATIONS** - 70,000 USDC\n- **TECHO** \t\n    - *House Building Campaign*\n        - Site Preparation, Building Materials, Permit & Legal Fees, Infrastructure, Furnishing, Transportation, House Amenities\t\n    - *Water Catchment System*\n        - Materials, Transportation, Replacement Filters, Cleaning Supplies, Maintenance Supplies, Water Treatment\t\n    - *Tubing Systems*\t\n        - Pipes and Fittings, Pumping System, Excavation and Installation, Water Source Development, Transportation, Maintenance Cost \n- **JOMPEAME**\n    - *Pedriatic Neurological Medical Aid*\n        - Medications, Image Testing, Lab Tests, Assistive Devices, Transportation, Physiotherapy Equipment, Specialized Medical Supplies, Dietary Supplements, Home Care Items\n- **SAVE THE CHILDREN**\t\n    - *Nounish Workshops*\n        - Clothing Supplies, Food Donations, School Supplies, Educational Workshops, Art Workshops, Sport Equipment for 1000-3000 children.\t\n\n### **Media Production & Content Creation - 25,000 USDC**\n- 25,000 USDC for content team + 12,000 USDC that were saved up from last proposal*\n    1.

If you’re new to CC0, it’s a \"no copyright reserved\" option in which all copyright is relinquished and dedicated to the public domain. This enables use of CC0 NFTs with zero legal repercussions, inspiring creative derivatives and remixes of original works. \n \nCC0 may be everywhere, but here’s a lesser-known fact: Creative Commons is also a whole nonprofit organization (see our most recent annual report [here](https://creativecommons.org/2023/04/11/state-of-the-commons-2022/)).  \n\nWe’ve been around since 2001 and are a small but mighty team of 22 open access enthusiasts. We not only manage the CC licenses and public domain tools, we run campaigns, programming, and training in Open Education, Culture, Climate, and Journalism; host a CC Global Summit in locations around the world; and tackle major policy issues impacting the Internet and global commons as part of a broad Movement for a Better Internet.  \n\nWe’re doing a lot, but it is all in service of the CC licenses, a thriving commons, and a healthy public domain, which can be expanded instantly by contemporary creators embracing the use of CC0, a globally interoperable public domain dedication tool. Like Nouns, we’re big promoters of remix culture, and have been watching (largely from the sidelines until now!) as NFT creators bring new energy and enthusiasm to the public domain.  \n\nWe’re excited to bring our two communities together to demonstrate the staying power of open access tools like CC0 even in a technological landscape that’s rapidly changing. Nouns is a prime example of this. You’re an open-source brand merging CC0 with blockchain. Nouns demonstrates the imaginative possibilities of combining public interest tools like CC Licenses with emergent technologies.\n\n## Request\nDespite being components of longstanding and emerging technologies, CC licenses are hard to fundraise for–most people are unaware that there’s no underlying revenue stream to maintain their legal and tech infrastructure and continue to advocate for their use. The licenses are not new tech anymore, despite constantly being used in fresh ways, and it’s challenging when most funders are more interested in flashy new projects than supporting the work those ventures build on. \n\nWe are dedicated to preserving and improving our licenses, so that they can continue to be the go-to tool for future technology and creative work. That’s why CC is seeking funding for our general operations and license infrastructure, which would allow us to sustain currently underfunded but foundational areas of work: advocating for the use and adoption of open content at all levels and in all arenas, stewarding and innovating the licensing infrastructure we provide, and training future generations of creators and open advocates. \n\nWith support from Nouns, Creative Commons can prioritize the stewardship of the tools that have unlocked access to an estimated 2 billion works over the past 20 years.

If you have other questions, join the [discussion telegram group](https://t.me/+rfuoI8SkzxdhYjRh) and ask.\n\n### Is there enough capacity on Cozy v2 for the DAO to get the proposed amount of protection?\n\nYes. At the time of writing there’s currently ~$1M of available stETH peg protection protection on Cozy v2. \n\n### How exactly does the “bid” work?\n\nUpon execution of this proposal:\n\n1. The tokenbuyer will be configured with a bid price of 2% (which translates to ~1.5% APR) for stETH peg protection tokens\n2. 12 ETH is transferred from the DAO treasury to the tokenbuyer\n3. Third party arbitrageurs sell protection tokens to the tokenbuyer in exchange for ETH  \n\nAny ETH that isn’t purchased by arbitrageurs can be withdrawn by the DAO. \n\nFor more details on how the token buyer works, visit this [github repo](https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer). \n\n### Is $1M of protection enough if the DAO has exposure to $26M of stETH?\n\nThe spirit of this proposal is to conduct a small scale pilot, so the scale is sized accordingly. If the DAO sees value from the pilot, it could decide to scale up protection over time.\n\n### How is ownership of the deployed contracts configured?\n\n[OptimismL1Proxy](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4d6EC0e31c9177c696Fb49c2Ad04aB766e91F38f) has the [NounsDAOExecutor](https://nouns.center/dev/smart-contract-architecture) as its L1OwnerAddress.

We will determine how to divide up the 25,000 pieces in order to achieve the best possible dispersal around the world. We'd like to gang up shipments (one shipment per geographic area) so that the recipients can disperse smaller shipments to more recipients in the same geographic area.\n\n**On demand distribution:** Any left over stock beyond what is shipped to Builders will ship to our US warehouse where it will be processed and stored until it is needed by various funded props or people who buy them from us in bulk or in smaller quantities as needed at a discount. This will enable us to ship Proliferator Packs and disperse them around the world in single efficient packages.\n\n**Some examples of how the products could be used:**\n\nBundled “Party Packs”\n\n“Passed” Prop welcome bundle includes a case of 10 plastic Noggles, 50 paper Noggles and 50 pins.

Usage of the included QR code (which leads to the Nountown Linktree) spikes around these activations. January 1, 2023 was the Rose Parade where the LoFi Noggles were handed out:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJeMbFQjY3.jpg)\n\n\nWe see similar spikes just after NFT Paris & NFT NYC dates, and the Licensing show in late June had a significant click-through spike because we instructed people to scan the QR code on site. (LoFi Noggles were also handed out at each of those events).\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryrFMZiK3.png)\n\nThe spikes in Linktree visits directly affect traffic to a variety of useful Nounish links including Nouns.wtf, Nounish.world, plus our informational website, Nouns shop, etc. This is proliferation in action! A really interesting note is that the people who receive the Noggles take them home and interact with the QR codes even more in the week following the event:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryK6GGjK2.png)\nAbove, see the gradual increase in views (green) and clicks (purple) in the 3 days immediately following the Rose Parade (Jan 1). So none of the spikes are 1-day spikes, they are all nearly a week of increased traffic and discovery by people all over the world:\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJBxmfit2.png)\n\n\n**About us:** As a veteran manufacturer in the Nouns ecosystem, [NOUNWORKS](https://twitter.com/nounworks) has a proven pipeline for delivering quality products.

We had a small batch of 30 donated by another grantee, and they went like hotcakes. People really liked them and it was a good way for people to feel good after a run and they just GOT the good vibes.\"*\n\n**Pizza DAO:** *\"Was incredibly excited to be able to distribute these at our Global Pizza Event. Also, having them at our events offered another layer of experience for our party attendees by offering them as a “prop-for-participation” (it was great for attendees to be able to jump in a photo or video and play “pass the noggles,” etc…while meeting up for some pizza). Enjoy the energy this can bring to events all over! Would love to get a bunch for future events!\"*\n\n**Mucho Love:** *\"Lo-Fi Noggles are more than just fun cardboard eyewear for Mucho Love. They serve as a tangible manifestation of the spirit and ethos of our organization. As we engage in our various activations, these Noggles serve as an icebreaker, a conversation starter, and a symbol of our commitment to spreading joy and positivity. They enhance our content’s recognizability, making it stand out and resonate with audiences familiar with Nouns. They are instrumental in fostering community, spreading our message, and enhancing the impact of our work.\"\"*\n\n**Serpunk:** *I think this is a good idea.

That cost will be covered by the recipients or their props.\n\n# Info about our previous order:\n10K units were paid for by Nouns DAO (NSFW) and an additional 3K units were paid for by Bigshot.

Estimated to be $3-5M a year. Basis of the estimate is explained in detail in the proposal below.\n\n**Main value proposition to users of this product:** Increases users' asset allocation to hot wallets, thus helping users access DeFi and the metaverse in an agile, secure and comfortable manner, reducing time costs and transaction costs involved regularly refilling hot wallet accounts. Not a single hot wallet product exists in B2C form that gives users access to fully flexible threshold signing schemes. Nouns Wallet will be the first to introduce this idea, and in a fully transparent manner.\n\n**Ask:** \n25 ETH round 1\n\n25 ETH round 2\n\n**Detailed Proposal:**\n\nThe B2C hot wallet market has been under the firm grip of MetaMask, riding high on its first-mover advantage. However, this dominance has left customers vulnerable to unfair policies and practices imposed by MetaMask. First, they sneaked away from open-source code to closed-source. And now, brace yourself, their updated privacy policies grant them the power to track user IP addresses and more! Sure, they claim not to keep this data for more than 7 days or sell it, but can we really verify that? Who will be held accountable for any shenanigans? What are the loopholes in this web of secrecy? Plus, let's not forget, this opens up a single point of attack for snooping into customer data. The only way to escape this labyrinth is through complete transparency of code.\n\nBut wait, there's another gaping hole in the B2C hot wallet industry! It's the absence of fully flexible threshold signing schemes for users. Hot wallets are crucial for interacting with web3 applications and protocols. However, these hot wallets, like MetaMask, store the entire private key on the user's machine. It's like leaving the door wide open for attacks, as the key remains decrypted for the duration of wallet activity, in order to make digital signatures.\n\nNow, some wallets try to beef up security and tackle this single point of attack issue by offering 2-factor authentication (2FA) or even 3-factor authentication (3FA). But guess what? These traditional forms of 2FA or 3FA rely on third-party applications that specialize in 2FA, like Authy, Duo Mobile, or Google Authenticator, and/or depend on third-party entities, such as 2FA from Google Cloud or email codes. This introduces the dreaded risk of a centralized point of failure! It forces users to always have access to these third parties and assumes they will function flawlessly. Some wallets even offer 2FA through their own mobile apps or via SMS codes, but alas, this makes users susceptible to SIM swap attacks. And let me tell you, SIM swap attacks have wreaked havoc on crypto holders in the past. Countless articles on the internet can attest to that.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, some wallets have attempted MultiSig, where one signature is required from the user's key and another from the company's key. But let me tell you, this setup is not only inefficient and inflexible, but also lacks ironclad security. Inflexible because any changes to the keys, adding or removing them, require rewriting the code. It's like making it set in stone when it comes to signing policies (2 of 2 or 2 of 3 being the most common) and the keys generated and used. Moreover, MultiSig demands exorbitant transaction fees due to the need for higher block space or, in simpler terms, multiple signatures required to sign the transaction on the chain.\n\nBut behold! We have the ultimate solution to tackle all of the above conundrums: Fully Open-Sourced Threshold Signing! Sounds cool, right? It's time to revolutionize the game and bring back the fun, security, and flexibility that users truly deserve!\n\n1-minute explainer video: [![Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/uhbaVoQMKDU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhbaVoQMKDU)\n\n\n![Image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1FgrRd7k2ckTGqV1ByW1LyC5FbqBg3fBX)\n\n\n\nAdditionally, being fully open sourced makes us verifiably user-friendly in terms of privacy policies and security.\n\n**Estimated Revenue to the Nouns treasury from this project**\n\nLet's dive into the exciting realm of revenue figures! If we cast our eyes upon [this chart](https://dune.com/queries/19721/40444), MetaMask has been raking in around $200,000 per day in fees over the past few months. That's a whopping $70 million per year, give or take! For more in-depth insights, you can check out the [comprehensive dashboard](https://dune.com/tomhschmidt/metamask-swap) and enlightening [article](https://thedefiant.io/metamask-raking-in-170k-day-shows-defi-wallets-work-as-businesses) on MetaMask's daily and cumulative swap fee revenue.\n\nNow, let's shift our focus to Exodus, a prominent player in the hot wallet scene. In the last two Q3s, their quarterly revenues reached a commendable $18 million and $11 million, respectively. If you're hungry for details, head over to [this page](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/11/09/2552383/0/en/Exodus-Report-Third-Quarter-2022-Results.html) and feast your eyes on the specifics.\n\nBut here's the exciting part: We aim to compete head-on with MetaMask and other hot wallets by offering a threshold MPC system ingeniously integrated into browser extension and web app hot wallets. With all the potential this project holds, we conservatively estimate that it could eventually churn out a remarkable $3 million to $5 million per year in swap fees alone. And who knows, it might even soar to the astounding heights of $70 million, just like MetaMask!\n\nWhen it comes to revenue distribution, we've got a plan. For the first three years, the revenue will be divided into a 90-10 split between the Nouns Treasury and the devoted development team. This approach ensures resources are allocated for continuous product enhancements and growth. However, after the three-year mark, the Nouns DAO holds the power to either renew this revenue split or gracefully take 100% of the revenue for themselves.\n\n**Funding Ask and Deliverables**\n[Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/6YX5xeU16rpvhybQm8OMhR/Nouns-Wallet?node-id=1-2&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2)\n\n![Image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1WKE6IrnbiDURXj5DwTGbfmVKP7GeG5QM)\n\n**25 ETH Round 1** – With a solid infusion of 25 ETH, we will kickstart the development of a basic yet functional Threshold Signing wallet. Within a swift timeline of just 2 months from the funding date, our talented team will focus their expertise on cryptography and backend wizardry. The frontend will have a simple, user-friendly interface adorned with a logo inspired by the captivating Nouns theme. To proudly showcase our collaboration, the wallet interface will prominently display \"Powered by NounsDAO.\" During this initial phase, we will demo the threshold signing capability exclusively on laptops. But fret not, as we have big plans for Round 2!\n\n\n**25 ETH Round 2** – Round 2, brace yourselves for greatness! With another 25 ETH in hand, we will elevate the UI/UX design aimed to maximize user experience and simplicity, ensuring that our wallet becomes an intuitive and seamless companion for crypto enthusiasts. As we fine-tune every detail, the wallet will be prepared for its grand launch. The timeline for this monumental event will be thoughtfully and collaboratively decided between our passionate team and the vibrant Nouns community.\n\n**Team**\nThe team building this are specialists in advanced cryptography and are also currently building a trustless bridge between non EVM chains.\nTo find out more about the team go to:\n[insaanity.io](https://insaanity.io)\n\n**Feedback from the Nouns community taken into consideration**\n\nWe express our heartfelt gratitude to the vibrant Nouns community on Discord and Discourse for their active participation and valuable feedback on our proposal. Your insights have been instrumental in shaping our approach, and we greatly appreciate your engagement.\n\nIn our previous communication, we had initially proposed a funding amount of 250 ETH for Round 2, with a significant portion of 200 ETH allocated towards code audits. This decision was primarily driven by our intention to utilize our proprietary threshold signing algorithm, which boasted certain advantages over the already audited threshold cryptography schemes available in the market. Notably, our algorithm showcased resilience against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, providing an added layer of security.\n\nHowever, we carefully considered the community's concerns regarding the substantial expenditure of 200 ETH solely on code audits. We wholeheartedly understand and respect the need for responsible resource allocation. Therefore, we have revised our approach and made the decision to leverage already existing standard audited libraries as our foundation, building upon their established security foundations. This strategic shift has significantly reduced our funding request to a modest 25 ETH.\n\nTo address any lingering apprehensions regarding DoS attacks, we have further fine-tuned our strategy. Out of B2B and/or B2C options, we will adopt the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) model, where the distribution of key shares will be limited to one's own devices and/or trusted family members' devices, rather than across unknown communities' devices. This approach ensures a more controlled and secure environment, where the threat of DoS attacks can be safely assumed to be absent.\n\nWe remain committed to our goal of delivering an exceptional threshold signing wallet, fortified by security best practices and community-driven input. Your feedback has been invaluable in shaping our path forward, and we are excited to continue this journey together, building a product that exceeds expectations.\n\nOnce again, we extend our sincere appreciation to the Nouns community for your unwavering support and collaboration. Let's embark on this exciting endeavor, shaping the future of hot wallets with utmost diligence and innovation!\n\n\n\n"},{"blockNumber":17685739,"blockHash":"0xa34bafaed7b8cb948b0c89e9172042a21f62155de584ccbc7272fbd68ba5621b","transactionIndex":108,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x98699c2a168d11ede6cc00550c8e471bc7606ab8b53ef74a36d0c1b1f5b85310","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":336,"proposer":"0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9","targets":["0xb47e3cd837dDF8e4c57F05d70Ab865de6e193BBB"],"signatures":["enterBidForPunk(uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001e7c"],"startBlock":17721739,"endBlock":17757739,"description":"# Bid on Alien Punk\n\nIt's an interesting idea and I don't think the original proposer should have cancelled.

This is now for only 3 months and covers 1 full time dev + Joel Cares (part time strategy & dev).*\n\n*The primary work in this proposal is in continued development of Nerman.js, a Nouns SDK to help developers building in the Nouniverse. Actual discord bot development is a smaller part of the workload.*\n\n*We have also added much more specific features to each section in support of the general vision communicated before. Lesson learned - Nouns DAO does in fact prefer to see the long proposals with comprehensive details.*\n\n---\n\n## INTRO\n\n---\n\nNerman was funded by Nouns DAO through [Prop 77](https://nouns.wtf/vote/77). Our team has been hard at work programming Nerman's various bots and libraries since then. Check out [nerman.wtf](https://nerman.wtf) for a summary of the project and links to the various code repositories.\n\nIn this proposal we focus our efforts on two things:\n\n1. **Nerman.js ([GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman.js), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nerman))**\n2. **Nounish Feeds - Discord Bot ([GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman))**.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## NERMAN.JS - A NOUNS SDK\n\n---\n\nNerman.js provides simple type-safe access to Nouns DAO contract events, as well as custom events such as Noun O'Clock. The user provides a JSON-RPC url and connects directly to an Ethereum node without any further 3rd party hosted services.\n\nYou can install Nerman.js with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nerman)\n\n**DEMO - NOUN O'CLOCK**\n\n``` typescript\nimport * as nerman from \"nerman\";\nconst Nouns = new nerman.Nouns( JSON_RPC_API_URL );\nNouns.on(\"AuctionEnd\", (data : nerman.EventData.AuctionEnd) => {\n    // It's Noun O'Clock, do stuff here!!\n});\n```\n\nFor more code examples see the ReadMe in [GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman.js). Nerman.js currently supports listening to Nouns DAO events such as auction creation, auction bids, proposal creation, dao votes, Noun creation, Noun transfer, delegation changes, and more. We also launched support for [Nouns Nymz](https://nouns.nymz.xyz/) and have a live feed posting in a Nouns community Discord.\n\n**NEW FEATURES - EVENTS**\n\nNerman.js will provide and maintain access to events across the Nouniverse. For each event we will have:\n\n - properly typed listener functions\n - trigger functions and sample data for testing\n - unit tests with sample and live data\n - clear documentation on Nerman.wtf\n - easy config option in Nerman Discord bot for anyone to add customized event feeds to Discord\n\nNouns DAO Events\n - All DAO Contract Events completed as described above\n - Events that require further calculations, like Prop Voting Start, Prop Voting Complete (failed, or succeeded and ready to queue), Prop Ready to Execute\n - Helpers to better parse data + format posts (ie better prop transaction summaries)\n - Updates to v3 contract if it occurs within time period\n   \nProp House Events\n - When instantiating the Prop House object the user will specify a community address and get events specific to that House\n - RoundCreated, ProposingStarts, NewProposal, VotingStarts, NewVote, RoundComplete\n\nFederation Governance Pool\n - General tool for listening to Federation governance pool events, instantiated with the specific pool address\n - We will cover the basics (bid, cast vote, execute) and explore other useful events from the contract\n\nNounsNymz\n - New Post (already completed, live in NCD)\n\n**NEW FEATURES - INDEXING**\n\nNerman.js will index on-chain Nouns data. This indexed data allows Nerman to offer more complicated and instant analysis of the data, including reporting behavior of voters, bidders, vote participation rates, etc.\n\n - Pre-indexed Nouns data included with library\n - Library can continue indexing to keep data up to date\n - Or - go trustless - start from scratch and index everything yourself\n - All basic DAO data will be available through function calls\n - We will implement further functions that offer simple analysis, such as getting voter participation rates or a list of proposals sorted by transaction size.\n\n**NEW FEATURES - DOCUMENTATION**\n\n[Nerman.wtf](https://nerman.wtf) will be a canonical source of knowledge about the Nouniverse, above and beyond technical documentation of Nerman.js. Our resources will be a useful starting point for anyone developing in Nouns.\n\n- SEO research and optimization to target terms people are actually searching for\n- Canon documentation of Nounish contracts on Ethereum and their associated ABIs\n- Map of different off-chain and in development Nouns projects with links to websites\n\n---\n\n## DISCORD BOT - NOUNISH FEEDS\n\n---\n\nNerman offers customizable Nounish event feeds for Discord channels, displaying formatted embeds with the main Nouns DAO contract events from Nerman.js. Users can configure which events to display in a channel with a simple command.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyX8b1U_3.jpg)\n\n**CURRENT NOUNISH FEEDS**\n\n- **Agora Discord**\n  Auction and DAO Proposal events in #gov-updates channel\n- **A Nouns Community Discord**\n  Auction and Proposal events in #general channel\n  Nouns Nymz posts in #nouns-nymz\n- **Nouncil**\n  Auctions, Proposals, Token Transfers in Feeds Section\n  Proposal votes and status changes posted in appropriate Prop threads in #nouncil-votes\n\n\n**NEW FEATURES**\n\nWe will add all Nerman.js events as we create them, allowing easy Discord notifications from Nouns DAO, Prop House, Federation, etc.\n\n - All above events easily configured by any Discord admin.\n - Add support for arguments in event registration commands so we can use general tools (ie Prop House, Federation Goverance Pools) to create event listeners for any specific community.\n - Simple subscriptions to commonly grouped events (Auction, Goverance, transfer + delegation changes)\n - Improved formatting + data on embeds.\n - Continued work setting up and optimizing event feeds in Discords, including NCD, Agora, Nouncil, as well as general consulting to support feeds in communities.\n - Experimental feed ideas, like a 0 vote weight feed as an informal on-chain chat.\n - Discord forum integrations for Nouns DAO proposals where a thread is automatically created for each prop and DAO votes and prop status changes are posted in the appropriate threads.\n\n---\n\n## BONUS POINTS\n\n---\n\nWe intend to complete as much of the above scope as possible within 3 months. If we move ahead of schedule we will spend the remaining time working on the features below:\n\n**Contract events from Nounish DAOs**\nA generic NounishDAO object that takes a contract address as the argument, verifies the events that it supports, and offers instant access to supported events from any Nounish DAO (Lil Nouns, Gnars, Builder DAO, etc).\n\n**Snapshot Events**\nA Snapshot object that allows you to specify a community on Snapshot and listen to its events, such as new Proposals and votes, and to get results when the vote is complete. This will assist with automations for communities that use Snapshot to coordinate Nouns votes, like [SharkDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/sharkdao.eth) and [League of Lils](https://snapshot.org/#/leagueoflils.eth).\n\n**Discord forum integration for NounsNymz**\nWe can pipe NounsNymz into an automated Discord forum where each new top level comment is its own thread, and sub-comments are included in that thread. This presents the conversations better than a simple new comment feed and allows for non-nouner discord users to engage in the discussion as well. We can also support NounsNymz hashtags so prop specific comments can be piped into a Nouns DAO proposal forum.\n\n**Prop House - Token Specific Feeds**\nSpecify a token (ie Nouns DAO) and get notifications from all houses that use that token to vote. We could create a #nouns-prop-house channel that posts any new round Nouners can vote on along with their deadlines.\n\n**Image Helpers**\nA variety of helper functions for interacting with Nouns on-chain image data, rendering it and converting it between file formats, resizing, generating images from seeds, getting image data for addresses for profile images, etc.\n\n---\n\n## TERMS\n\n---\n\n- funding for the team to continue developing Nerman up to Oct 31, 2023. \n- all code will be open source and released under a permissive license (such as MIT).\n\n---\n\n## TRANSACTION\n\n---\n\n**Total Budget: 26 Ξ**\n1 full time dev + Joel Cares (part time)\n\n**Transaction**\n26 ETH streamed to 0x09b68020Fb9691C2c20687631EDCF16fdFCba277"},{"blockNumber":17692982,"blockHash":"0x2cd75900b7cdc7c57a1978770d7b4ce94898b251a85b48fd135f31cd6e511427","transactionIndex":121,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xa3c34db49c1c284c0bbff00bb5300550c7ded902cea6c8ca060ad5b702b70d43","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":338,"proposer":"0x860B328060180b2A14ae5C018AbA2Dd42D7ab6bA","targets":["0x860B328060180b2A14ae5C018AbA2Dd42D7ab6bA"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":17728982,"endBlock":17764982,"description":"# Bid on Ether Rock #0, S1E2\n\nFollowing suit with other illiquid treasury diversification proposals we've also lowered our request by the same amount of 16%!

During 3 day period of the ETHCon, people will be able to redeem t-shirts with only 2-stamps. \n- To achieve this, we kindly request $52,000 or around $3,600 per location to promote nouns at 10+ coffee shops, 2 retail stores, and 2 art galleries over the next three months.\n\n## Revisions of prop 322\n- Reduce funding from $65,000 to $52,000\n    - Removed magazine -$4,000\n    - Reduced t-shirts batch size -$9,000 (from 2,000 to 1,500)\n- Collaboration with a coffee shop next to [Ethcon](https://twitter.com/ethconkr/status/1675701724613591040) conference. The conference will bring together a lot of interesting people since **Vitalik** is a keynote speaker. The coffee shop will welcome conference and hackathon participants, where they can learn about Nouns, mingle, and redeem a t-shirt.\n- Five is going to join [HelloWeb3](https://twitter.com/hello_web3) conference as a speaker and it will be a good opportunity to launch Nouns' campaing and reach the target audience.\n\n### Details\nWe have observed the success of Nouns' flywheel in Brazil, China, Japan, and other communities. We propose to launch activation campaign in Korea in collaboration with ten authentic coffee shops. This campaign aims to educate people about nouns and engage them in the process. Participants will collect noggle-stamps and have the chance to earn stylish nounish t-shirts as rewards.\n\nOur team firmly believes in our energy and talent to establish Nouns as a prominent pop culture brand in Korea. The campaign will span three months, during which people will receive noggle-stamps with their coffee purchases. Once they collect 10 stamps, they can exchange a coupon card for a nounish t-shirt.\n\nTo ensure widespread exposure, all coffee shops will display posters and t-shirts. Furthermore, these t-shirts will be available for purchase at retail stores and art galleries. We are committed to creating high-quality t-shirts using nounish cc0 content, with additional approval from the artists involved.\n\n\nFor the successful activation of the nouns community in Korea and the promotion of Nouns in 14+ locations over three months, we kindly request $52,000 in funding.\n\n### The stamp collection campaign\n![](https://i.imgur.com/51HGjJe.jpg)\n\nThe campaign will focus on creating visibility, engaging local community, and establishing a loyal fan base. The coffee shops will become a place for people to gather and learn about nouns through arts on t-shirts and information in korean online.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1e0gbXuh.png)\n\nCoupon cards featuring nouns will be distributed at the coffee shops' counters. We anticipate each coffee shop to distribute around 50-30 coupon cards daily, totaling approximately 27,000 cards throughout the campaign. In our focused campaign, we will give out special coupon cards that need only 2 stamps to people who are interested in blockchain and NFTs through our network of friends.\n\n### T-shirts\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByDeX5Md3.jpg)\n\nT-shirts will be placed in highly visible areas at coffee shops. We'll use Nouns' cc0 content to create a beautiful collection of t-shirts. Our goal is to pleasantly surprise everyone with the quality and spirit of nounish artworks.\n\nThese t-shirts will be made from scratch specifically for this campaign from high-quality materials and tailored in various styles for both men and women. Each label and tag will feature Noggles and links to Noun's homepage and Twitter account.\n\nWe will strategically strive to get the t-shirts in the hands of pop stars, actors, musicians, and models.\n\nThe t-shirts will be the same as those for prop173, 'Sail in NY,' that received praise from the community for their quality.\n\n### Campaign map\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1Zj0T5u3.jpg)\n\nWe are going to collaborate with authentic coffee shops. Here are the links to coffee shops located in popular areas such as [Jeongno](https://www.instagram.com/cha.teul/), [Itaewon](https://www.instagram.com/theroyalfad/), and [Sinsa](https://www.instagram.com/minoscoffeecult/). Additionally, we are going to sell t-shirts at popular [Fashion and lifestyle](https://www.instagram.com/niceweather.seoul/) goods stores and [art galleries](https://www.instagram.com/print_bakery/).\nAs of now, we onboarded three coffee shops, one retail store, and one art gallery. We can rest of the partner properties recruited in no time.\n\n### Why Korea\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJUNQsvw2.jpg)\n\nKorea is known for its collection of cool nounish items, ranging from sailboats, resin toys, and children's books to motorcycles. In line with this, our goal is to unite and provide a firsthand experience to an increasing number of Nouns' fans. We believe that the timing is ideal to launch a nounish campaign, aiming to showcase the beautiful aspects of Nouns' art, culture, and governance. This initiative will not only attract a larger base of devoted fans but also facilitate the discovery of new nounish memes and contribute to the advancement of nounish culture.\n\n### Timeline\nThe campaign is scheduled to commence in July and continue until October.

Each episode takes us on a new challenge or puzzle to be solved by the protagonists. They embark on magical missions, explore galaxies, secret rooms, and discover hidden passages that lead to incredible worlds within the school. The school environment transforms into a place full of surprises, with magic, creatures, and fantastic moments.\n\nWhile facing exciting challenges, the protagonists also learn important lessons about friendship, courage, and teamwork.

All episodes after this first one will have a smaller, 1.5-month, production period each due to a lot of the ground work being done already, such as character and background development.\n\n\n# Distribution:\n\n#### - Youtube\nOur initial strategy will be to upload the series directly to a dedicated Youtube channel. **Content for kids on Youtube performs extremely well** and garners massive views. Our intent is to capture that audience and generate a significant viewership with a dedicated fanbase.\n\n#### - Droposal\nMuch like similar content released by Nouns, we will also seek to mint this first episode via a droposal.\n\n**However, we propose a novel distribution with 100% of the funds going back to the DAO.** The idea is to do a community poll with Nouners to decide the mint price.\nBased on the success of this first episode and mint sales we could see a significant revenue returning back to the DAO.\n# Road To Success:\n\nAfter the delivery of the pilot our intent is not only to produce the remaining episodes but to build the project into something even bigger. Here are some of the strategies we are planning:\n\n*(The following ideas are for the future of the project and not included in this proposal)*\n\n- Distribution Deal: Pursue partnerships through our industry contacts with TV channels and streaming providers - We believe the series would have a strong appeal to these companies as not only having a popular target audience of young teens but also by addressing new and innovative topics like blockchain and web3. \n- Merchandising and Toys: Partner with established companies to produce Merch and Toys featuring the characters in the series bringing another revenue stream for the series and the DAO.\n\n---\n\n# Budget Breakdown:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bG8tmAl.png)\n\n([Google sheet with complete budget breakdown](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1arqB7sFMJ9HpEraUbgLuhSR9cDxoOKv-pNQfC_2XP1I/edit?usp=sharing))\n\n\n**Total Ask: USDC $95.000** (~48 ETH at current prices)\n\n\n**This budget reflects the production of a high-quality, 6-minute animated pilot**, which also serves as the foundation for the series - this includes character design and personality, environment, plot, among other essential work.\n\n---\n## From The Team\n\n**Our objective is to create an amazing series that is unique and truly nounish.**\n\nWith this pilot we hope to showcase the concept and viability of this series, as well as lay a strong foundation on which we can build upon.\n\nOur team is passionate and commited to this project, many of us are strongly connected to the Nouns ecosystem and have a deep interest in its collective success.\n\nThank you!\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"blockNumber":17712193,"blockHash":"0x9a5656ca6772d0f4ff88641d54ec5401d7d3a1febb210a1897e292c9bd0cbdb8","transactionIndex":122,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xd89896c891ca48a2943c2c532341f2b48c1aad436633005dd926108135109260","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":341,"proposer":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000008b45d1caccb3593e9f1015ba8e97afb68de3a0d10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000861c46800"],"startBlock":17748193,"endBlock":17784193,"description":"# Establish Nouns FGC (Fighting Game Community) at EVO 2023\n\n![EVO Noggles](https://i.imgur.com/sCSnrda.png)\n\n\nProject Lead: [Keolaization](https://twitter.com/keolaization)\nSupported by The [Nouns Esports](https://twitter.com/nounsesports) Pod\n\n\n## Video Rundown - [Nouns Esports Audiovisual Proposal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rspS-OZAmw)\n\n## TLDR:\n\n*EVO is one of the world's biggest and most well-known fighting game tournaments. Yearly players from every corner of the globe come out to not only compete, but to fraternize and create memories that will last a lifetime.*\n\n*With the scale and magnitude of EVO within the fighting game community, this would be a perfect opportunity for Nouns Esports to expand from Smash into the larger fighting game esports sphere.*\n\n*Our objective this year is for Nouns to make a splash in the fighting game esports scene by sponsoring a large group of fighting game players at the largest fighting game tournament in the world! With the new Street Fighter title, this is the year to be at EVO and there would be many opportunities for the Nouns Esports brand to catch viewer and participant attention.*\n\n*Nouns Esports requests 36,000 USDC to sponsor a variety of fighting game players from around the world to attend EVO, the world’s largest fighting game tournament, taking place from Aug 4th to the 6th in 2023.*\n\n![EVO Tournament Pic](https://i.imgur.com/Xs9lUCU.jpg)\n\n\n## Description\n\n\n\nThis proposal expands our esports reach into the world of fighting games. \n\nSelection will be handled through [Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns-esports/) with Nouns Esports members providing outreach directly to fighting game community encouraging players to apply on the site.\n\n\n**Our plan:** \n- Around 30－40 Competitors at EVO\n    - All representing Nouns\n        - Noggles for all players + shirts\n- Noggles for all players\n- Nouns Esports shirts with a mock up visual for all players\n- Planned Nouns team-building/social event during EVO \n    - Idea: Pizza Party (potential PizzaDAO collab)\n- Planned media coverage (photos/video) - \n    - Questions like: \"What does Evo mean to you? Nouns?\"\n- start.gg affiliation (putting the Nouns custom tag when registering on start.gg for a tournament in the format of [Nouns | Keolaization]) \n\n**Funding Plan:**\n\n- 36,000 USDC ask \n- Unused funds will be returned\n    - Player Funding Cost (~75%)\n        - For each player the standard funding we will be providing to sponsor their travel and lodging is 300 USDC for North America and 800 USDC for international players\n    - Pizza Party/Social Event Funding Cost (~10%)\n            - Food: Pizza\n            - Drinks: Sodas/Water\n            - Venue: Either rent out a restauraunt/suite/conference space\n            - Other potential items: Plates, utensils, napkins, cups\n        - Possibility to run social event though PizzaDAO\n    - Operational Management and Support (~15%)\n        - Contributor pay\n        - Cost of travel for organizers to oversee the event\n        - Miscellaneous costs\n\n## **Why EVO?**\n\nLast year there were over 7,000 players participating from 63 different countries, with nearly 18,000 players in attendace at the venue, and over 3.7 million people who tuned in to the live stream for the event. This year, as COVID-19 restrictions loosen in many places around the world and things return to normal, it is guaranteed to grow even bigger. Especially with the prize pool minimum for main games being increased to $25,000, there will undoubtedly be more participants coming out to try prove their worth.\n\nMany select top players at this event are sponsored by various different companies and esports organizations, but there are many more who are either not sponsored despite their high levels of play or are sponsored but are not able to make it to Evo due to financial reasons such as lack of support from their team. This is where Nouns Esports can come into the picture.\n\nThrough players applying through Prophouse, we can sponsor select players based off of their skill as well as their needs to give them the chance to have the best possible experience at Evo. Whether it be a full ride for an extremely high level player or just a small boost to their funds, providing to the needs of the player will not only allow Nouns Esports to show their goodwill to the community, but can also spread the Nouns Esports brand and the Nouns brand to a potentially new community. Not only that, but if we can successfully sponsor the most players, it would be a huge PR win for the organization.\n\n\n\n## Who We Are\n\nNouns Esports was established in [Proposal 68](https://nouns.wtf/vote/68). We have since continued Nouns proliferation through esports as seen in [Proposal 91](https://nouns.wtf/vote/91), [Proposal 112](https://nouns.wtf/vote/112), [Proposal 119](https://nouns.wtf/vote/119).\n\nDota 2 & CS:GO\nPokemon Unite\nTaki & Aklo\n\n[nouns.gg](https://nouns.gg)\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/nounsesports)\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/nounsesports)\n\n\n\n\n## **Multisig**\n\nWe will be using the same multisig that was created for [Proposal 263](https://nouns.wtf/vote/263) consisting of Nouners and Nounsfolk. \n\n- Sasquatch\n- Brennen\n- Maty\n- Oni\n- Peter\n\n![Nouns Esports Logo](https://i.imgur.com/rPHF40P.jpg)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll in all, we are looking to make a splash in the larger fighting game esports scene by setting the right foot forward and trying to make history. We really believe that we can gain traction and show our Nounish values to the larger community to create a long lasting relationship that will benefit both sides.\n\n### **Thank you for reading!**\n\n\n"},{"blockNumber":17716164,"blockHash":"0x40673a9679ab09f3cf3a839f3c793d77e11636f90bcbeb7295851c85188f7ddc","transactionIndex":133,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x2db6c2304555741d9d2a410923c27f01cb2e4569db1daf3d0c64b08f67864ced","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":342,"proposer":"0x1e593f141c90f8638eD657634cC62f5BdCf9CFEb","targets":["0xb47e3cd837dDF8e4c57F05d70Ab865de6e193BBB"],"signatures":["buyPunk(uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001711"],"startBlock":17752164,"endBlock":17788164,"description":"# Buy Alien Punk (#5905) v3\n\n## \"Bulls and Bears make money, Arbs get slaughtered.\" ##\n\nIt's an excellent idea and I don't think 4156, or the original proposer should have cancelled.

Proposal**\n\n## **Why we should fund this idea?**\n\n**Collect & Store**\n* We are building a platform where we gather all nounish cc0 materials & contents in one location for easy access and use.\n* Our platform supports a wide range of file types, enabling users to start using them instantly. *(eg; img, video, audio, 3D, figma, pdf etc)*\n* We provide a sitemap for better information accessibility and a solid overview of the contents.\n* We are using Arweave network to store all the datas due to its one time fee permanent storage and we want to use it exclusively for all storage going forward. The cost of uploading has been factored in under OpEx in Budget.\n\n*cc0-lib-3d (eg; .glb, .fbx, .blend)*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJF6Z9Qc3.gif)\n\n*cc0-lib-working-files (eg; .figma, .pdf)*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/By78Mc75h.gif)\n\n*cc0-lib-random*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1VKQc7cn.gif)\n\nBy end of the year, we will receive a huge addition to the cc0 library by getting various of [open-source nounish hardware & schematics files](https://nouns.wtf/vote/277) *([Noggles LED Keychain](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1645788540499025920?s=20), [Nouns Governance Wallet](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1631322679172112384?s=20), [USB E-Ink Displaying Daily Nouns & Props](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1625883686561275905?s=20), [Etch-A-Sketch](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1624120919152001040?s=20), [Noggles Speakers](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1637133435549495297?s=20), and [Nouns Camera](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1646167941178703872?s=20))* from [Tigris](https://twitter.com/tigrisli) which would onboard more builders to the platform if everything goes accordingly.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJMohcWFh.gif)\n\nOn top of that, we can help builders continue to proliferate in their own creativity, context & interpretations if we could get more of these materials from the Nouniverse such as [giant noggles sculpture by Alps DAO](https://twitter.com/tha_swami/status/1674652226370048000?s=20), [noggles skate rail by vladhzc & Gnars DAO](https://twitter.com/vladhzc/status/1604573891300663296?s=20), [recycled plastic noggles by marinioac](https://twitter.com/marinioac/status/1676206035017650176?s=20).

We also integrated with Farcaster, a decentralized social network, as any responses for a cc0-lib's content url will be displayed under *fc comments* on the corresponding cc0-lib's content page. For example → [https://warpcast.com/n1/0x69b8c3](https://warpcast.com/n1/0x69b8c3)\n* We provide search persistence which allows users to persist the last search history they made on the website.\n* RSS - [cc0-lib.wtf/feed.xml](https://cc0-lib.wtf/feed.xml)\n\n*cc0-lib-fav*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ0Rzv7qh.gif)\n\n*cc0-lib-comment*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByEVVqQc2.png)\n\n**Contribute**\n* We provide a submission page for builders and artists to share their project materials within the ecosystem.\n* We want users to remix and shape new ideas upon the materials in any medium they prefer, fostering creativity in the ecosystem.\n* We introduce a contributor's leaderboard with the idea of incorporating a gamified experience to encourage participation in the ecosystem.\n* We are planning to create a token rewards system for contributors: Implement a system where contributors are rewarded with tokens based on their level of contribution to incentivize their participation. For example ;\n    * Tie unique NFTs (1/1s or OEs) to different levels of contribution (eg; 10, 50, 100, 1000 files)\n    * Organize challenges or competitions where contributors can compete and earn additional tokens or special NFT rewards based on their performance.\n    * Participation NFTs for prop house round, airdropped to all contributors / participants\n\n*cc0-lib-leaderboard*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJi2b5Qqn.gif)\n\n*cc0-lib-rewards (example)*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk7C8Yjth.png)\n\n---\n\n### **Public API**\n\n* We are excited to announce that we have introduced a public API under the /api/data endpoint, enabling users to effortlessly retrieve data for various purposes.\n* Developers can use the cc0-lib's public API to access a wide range of data, including images, videos, audio files, and more. \n* With this comprehensive collection of CC0 licensed content, developers can integrate high-quality media into their applications, websites, and creative projects with ease. \n* Whether you're building a content aggregator, a creative platform, or a media-rich application, the CC0 library's public API provides a valuable resource for accessing and utilizing CC0 licensed content.\n\nAPI → [cc0-lib.wtf/api](https://cc0-lib.wtf/api)\n\n---\n\n## **3. What we are looking to build next?**\n\nThese are the upcoming enhancements and features we will implement in the near future. We will also integrate based on user's feedbacks.\n\n- users profile & web3 connect\n- bookmark/pin\n- token rewards system for contributors\n- open-sourcing\n- more cc0 communities, more cool stuffs!\n\n---\n\n## **4.

The information is scattered. Accountability is important.\n \nWhat I have done since being funded in [Proposal 174](https://nouns.wtf/vote/174)\n- I have followed up with builders of all funded projects and shared all the awesome work they've done.\n- I am trying to get the most out of these projects in other ways too - trying to salvage \"failed\" projects, getting assets and items that might otherwise go to waste.\n- Thanks to those follow-ups, I have contributed to a lot of ETH being returned to the DAO, both in terms of leftover funds and forgotten volatility buffers (~150 ETH in total). \n- All of the data is stored in interconnected Notion dashboards, which allow searching and filtering based on many properties (category, value, true cost, ..).\n\n\n## Newsletter - [nouns.substack.com](https://nouns.substack.com/)\nNouns DAO is very active, with hundreds of funded projects & still more seeking funding. That means there is a lot of information, scattered throughout different channels (multiple Discord servers, Discourse, Twitter, ..).\n\n- I'm publishing a weekly [newsletter](https://nouns.substack.com/) highlighting the biggest things happening around Nouns, showcasing new and existing projects, proposals, art, and more. \n- Serves both as an information distribution mechanism and as a historic snapshot of the DAO ([Example](https://nouns.substack.com/p/raising-from-the-ashes)).\n- Special posts for Prop House Rounds, Accountablity specials, etc.\n- I've been publishing it since February 2022 without missing a single week = 100+ published posts with over 41,000 reads in total.

However, they are not easy to do well because it's difficult to put one together both technically and socially.\n\nWe're going to build a super fast and easy to use droposal creator that also automatically updates nouns.wtf and and other frontends to feature any drops that the DAO approves.\n\n### What's the problem?\n\nWe know that Droposals can be wildly impactful. They can:\n1. Generate hundreds of ETH of revenue for the DAO and Builders\n2. Create more accessible ownership to canonical Nouns media\n3. Curate our best creations, making our body of work more legible\n\nTalking to builders, there seems to be two major barriers to creating more successful droposals:\n\n1. Creating a droposal is not easy – it requires putting together a complex transaction, and is subject to the same level of approvals as a potential protocol upgrade\n3. Even when you do manage create one, droposals are only successful if we're able to rally the whole community behind the mint\n\nAs a result, although Droposals have demonstrated success, we have not been able to make use of the format consistently as a community.\n\n\n### What we're doing\nWe're going to make it super easy to deploy and rally all of our attention resources behind droposals. The goal is to make it super easy to create a drop, and then to rally the DAO's excitement arond the mint. Concretely, this means a few things:\n\n**Step 1: Create a simple and powerful Drops Creator**\nWe'll deploy a drops-specific gov contract and a super easy to use droposal creator at nounsagora.com/drop. More details on how this contract works in the next section!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJqFrgI9n.png)\n\n**Step 2: Make drops incredibly exciting!**\nWe'll update both nounsagora.com and nouns.wtf to display droposal mints on the front page when there is one. This helps bring attention to the drop, further bring it into canon, and rally the community's excitement. \n\nOver the long term, we'll also work with other NFT sites like Zora and others to feature Nouns Drops so that getting your Droposal approved will catapult an artist to the top of every NFT site.\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S15Z7Ew52.png)](https://i.imgur.com/dCASfeo.mp4)\n\n**Step 3: Profit and proliferate!**\nBy making droposals accessible and impactful for artists, we think this Proposal will not only pay for itself, but also help us monetize and promote all future media funded by Nouns.\n\n### Drops creator contract early design\n\nSo how does the Drops creator actually work? Well, it's a bit like a mini governor contract controlled by Nouns token holders strictly for the purpose of managing and issuing drops. It does a two things: \n\n**Issue drops**\nAka create Droposals according to one of the types available.\n\n**Manage drop types**\nDrop types dictate the terms of the drop (price, editions, etc) in advance so that artists only have to put up their media for voters to decide whether they're excited about the work itself. \n\nOn launch, we will initiate the contract with a single flagship proposal type modeled after the successful This Is Nouns drop. The rough terms we're thinking are: 12 per year, 0.069ETH, 3000 editions. Split will be 60% artist, 30% DAO, 10% Agora.\n\nAnyone can create a type and set their own params, including fee. We could see there being many other types that are stewarded by different teams with different economics and cadence such as:\n* Free drop: free & unlimited on an L2, optimistically approved droposal\n* Oscars drop: only one allowed per year, more expensive, and high quorum to pass\n* Drops segmented by media type: episodes of a movie, Nounish\n\n\n### Future considerations\nIf the initial feature is successful, we have many ideas on how we can push drops even further:\n\n* We can make it easy to drop on L2s, which could be especially meaningful for free mints.\n* Approval voting can be used to choose one of many proposals to mint as the yearly \"Best media\". Almost like the Oscars of Nouns media\n* Droposals can act as a curation mechanism for us to find \"the best of\" Nouns. Using this, we can create a high quality Nouns media site showcasing our best work. Ranking on the site can be determined by the popularity of the mint\n\n\n### Funding & logistics\n\n**Funding**\n* We request 20ETH upfront to cover costs\n* Agora will charge a 10% fee on the flagship droposal type, and will return the first 20ETH in fees to the nouns treasury via a [0xSplit waterfall](https://docs.0xsplits.xyz/core/waterfall).\n* Anyone meeting the proposal threshold can create a droposal type with no fee (all dropoasal types will be minted from the same address)\n\n**Timeline**\n* Agora will provide biweekly progress updates\n* Expected to complete all within 2 months\n* When the contract is completed, another proposal will be created to deploy the drops creator and set its name to drops.nouns.eth"},{"blockNumber":17780274,"blockHash":"0xab21c3177dcdcae883ff999c0b93094296ea523db29e16f07333635c7e5baadd","transactionIndex":130,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x5631f4b0b1a9da2c7caa43cca7c418e70b8354738d6c2527a68cf739de5e7d19","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":347,"proposer":"0x84044988e0754decAa7444d19c8BF069B977F128","targets":["0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5","0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["setBaselinePaymentTokenAmount(uint256)","withdrawPaymentToken()"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002e90edd000","0x"],"startBlock":17816274,"endBlock":17852274,"description":"# Lowering the USDC amount held by the Payer contract from the current 500,000 USDC to 200,000 USDC\n\nWith the first version of the upcoming upgrade the treasury assets are currently held by the

wouldn't receive their fair split.\n\nIn order for a fair forking mechanism I propose to reduce the USDC amount held by the Payer contract from the current 500,000 USDC to 200,000 USDC.\n\nAt the moment the TokenBuyer contract has a balance of 114.73 ETH, approximately 213K USD which means there is some buffer left still at the current price of ETH after the swap of ETH for 200,000

If you’re new to CC0, it’s a \"no copyright reserved\" option in which all copyright is relinquished and dedicated to the public domain. This enables use of CC0 NFTs with zero legal repercussions, inspiring creative derivatives and remixes of original works. \n\nCC0 may be everywhere, but here’s a lesser-known fact: Creative Commons is also a whole nonprofit organization (see our most recent annual report [here](https://creativecommons.org/2023/04/11/state-of-the-commons-2022/)). \n\nWe’ve been around since 2001 and are a small but mighty team of 22 open access enthusiasts. We not only manage the CC licenses and public domain tools, we run campaigns, programming, and training in Open Education, Culture, Climate, and Journalism; host a CC Global Summit in locations around the world; and tackle major policy issues impacting the Internet and global commons as part of a broad Movement for a Better Internet. \n\nWe’re doing a lot, but it is all in service of the CC licenses, a thriving commons, and a healthy public domain, which can be expanded instantly by contemporary creators embracing the use of CC0, a globally interoperable public domain dedication tool. Like Nouns, we’re big promoters of remix culture, and have been watching (_largely from the sidelines until now!_) as NFT creators bring new energy and enthusiasm to the public domain.  \n\nWe’re excited to bring our two communities together to demonstrate the staying power of open access tools like CC0 even in a technological landscape that’s rapidly changing. Nouns is a prime example of this. You’re an open-source brand merging CC0 with blockchain. Nouns demonstrates the imaginative possibilities of combining public interest tools like CC Licenses with emergent technologies. \n\n# Request\n\nDespite being components of longstanding and emerging technologies, CC licenses are hard to fundraise for–most people are unaware that there’s no underlying revenue stream to maintain their legal and tech infrastructure and continue to advocate for their use. The licenses are not new tech anymore, despite constantly being used in fresh ways, and it’s challenging when most funders are more interested in flashy new projects than supporting the work those ventures build on. \n\nWe are dedicated to preserving and improving our licenses, so that they can continue to be the go-to tool for future technology and creative work. That’s why CC is seeking funding for our general operations and license infrastructure, which would allow us to sustain currently underfunded but foundational areas of work: advocating for the use and adoption of open content at all levels and in all arenas, stewarding and innovating the licensing infrastructure we provide, and training future generations of creators and open advocates. \n\nWith support from Nouns, Creative Commons can prioritize the stewardship of the tools that have unlocked access to an estimated 2 billion works over the past 20 years. We are hoping your community will support us, as our work has supported your creativity.\n\n# Proposed Transactions\n\nDue to challenges that arise when Endaoment smart contracts are paired with Nouns proposal duration, this revised version of Prop 329 sends 100 ETH directly to Creative Commons' hosted wallet: \n\n0xf28ed835261b005C490D9d3D9eaADC54d9737d87"},{"blockNumber":17805969,"blockHash":"0x54469708e081d64252c1572ad8abe5605cc8b9f17c382cf1fca19d8b6e94b309","transactionIndex":87,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x257a847c13a8bae9d3cc7631d63c0671dfa4d77fa8a871c0b10c7e5921ff9278","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":350,"proposer":"0xd3e2e76e4Ab0322614fe7aaA3be0B04beD83d0D0","targets":["0x0B789Ef2A2cda2fb5B5c7cdB278C2Cb8BdC96e4C"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":17841969,"endBlock":17877969,"description":"# Pay Dustin Yellin 50 eth to complete purchase of PERSON, PLACE, or THING\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of proposals 327 and 328.  328 was not properly executed and all of the NAC eth was transferred back to the nouns treasury.  As such, i am proposing that we approve a final 50 eth payment to complete the purchase of this sculpture.  As detailed below, we will then submit a new proposal for the first placement of the sculpture at Zero Bond in New York City.\n\nPrevious proposal text:\n\nIn April 2022 the Nouns DAO voted on and executed Proposal 48 - Nouns Psychogeography Sculpture with Dustin Yellin, wherein the Brooklyn-based artist was commissioned to update the Leviathan image by creating PERSON, PLACE, or THING, a new sculptural portrait layering each Nouns avatar into one fantastic body. For the commission, Yellin hand painted the 402 Nouns minted in Year One, integrating them into a unique glass artwork to forge a record of the history of the Nouns DAO, while branding its newest emblem.\n\nMuch like a yearbook, a ship’s manifest, or the signatures under a document, this snapshot provides a freeze frame of the DAO’s founders and builders. This in-all-is-one super-avatar represents the shared vision and trust between all stakeholders, while providing a rallying banner - an art object - that crystalizes how individuals are more powerful when they come together, and how a community can achieve the seemingly impossible by focusing its collective resources and talents around a common task.\n\nUpon acceptance of Proposal 48, the Nouns DAO compensated the artist with an initial deposit of 50ETH and made a donation of 100,000 USDC to the non-profit cultural center, Pioneer Works.\n\nA second payment of 50ETH and 1 Noun NFT (Noun 252 from the Nouns treasury) was agreed to be paid upon completion of the PERSON, PLACE, or THING sculpture and its accompanying NFT.\n\nLink to images of the finished sculpture: https://www.dustinyellin.com/d/6afb72\nLink to the NFT: Psychoprogeny - https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x3dde7d56735d5ab659544070679e9350d23d5b0b/2\n\nUpon acceptance of this proposal, the NFT for PERSON, PLACE, or THING will be transferred from DustinYellinDeployer to a Nouns DAO wallet.\n\nDustin Yellin Studio will then submit a new proposal to Nouns DAO requesting 12ETH to cover the expense of crating, transporting, and installing the 3,000 lb sculpture in the foyer of the main dining room of the Manhattan social club, Zero Bond, and back to the artist's studio at the conclusion of the loan period. The expected loan period will be 1-3 years, during which time Dustin Yellin Studio will work on additional loan placements for the work at museums and relevant cultural institutions worldwide.\n\nThe artist will provide an informative label to accompany the sculpture at Zero Bond, including details about the work and its ownership by Nouns DAO.\n\n50 ETH Deposit and transfer of Noun 252 to Dustin Yellin Studio:\n0x0B789Ef2A2cda2fb5B5c7cdB278C2Cb8BdC96e4C"},{"blockNumber":17818392,"blockHash":"0xd20695c0a99319fbb6edb09e14d759aa9c6788b291061f544e024c967fc8fb4f","transactionIndex":175,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xd191e9d1f47c6024ec0789300b00d1ea8647a5b109fbdb005d5bfdcf4b163fc3","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":351,"proposer":"0x021edd67d43B365a6401a5Ee704Aa6f264F3F4e4","targets":["0xf7e2d6b58F12616D0bF834Ef1A209887466d40A2"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":17854392,"endBlock":17890392,"description":"# Compensation for Anniversary Art Inclusion (Prop 348)\n\n\nThis proposal aims to compensate Amiyoko, Facu, Goldy, Index, Krel, Solimander, and Tummlin with a total of 88 eth for the collective efforts that went into [Prop 348](https://nouns.wtf/vote/348); inclusion of new traits on the Nouns DAO anniversary.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1koufSi2.png)\n\nNouns is truly an infinite work of art.

If the deal is not closed within 69 days, the entire stETH balance will be sent back to the Nouns DAO treasury.\n\nA walkthrough of the code has been posted here [https://0xtycoon.medium.com/nounsalien-solidity-contract-walkthrough-9233a4b9ee4e](https://0xtycoon.medium.com/nounsalien-solidity-contract-walkthrough-9233a4b9ee4e)\n\nThe contract has been simulated on block 17781581 using this simulation test posted to Github [https://github.com/0xTycoon/alien-flip/blob/master/test/simulate.js](https://github.com/0xTycoon/alien-flip/blob/master/test/simulate.js)"},{"blockNumber":17826241,"blockHash":"0x8b7c8fdaf288f73069801d1c8563b3c129ac1635258cea4282e05bb1a5761afa","transactionIndex":4,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xc17fc122f4941d2f0ca7020c4e0dc72f6d938be42a87f73dc5933c0608e1308c","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":353,"proposer":"0x05A286e5165D72823A749B00b009a2aF0dc36Ff7","targets":["0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71","0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","0x830BD73E4184ceF73443C15111a1DF14e495C706","0xae7ab96520DE3A18E5e111B5EaAb095312D7fE84","0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03","0x6229c811D04501523C6058bfAAc29c91bb586268","0xC1C119932d78aB9080862C5fcb964029f086401e","0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d"],"signatures":["","_setImplementation(address)","_setForkParams(address,address,address[],uint256,uint256)","_setVoteSnapshotBlockSwitchProposalId()","transferOwnership(address)","transfer(address,uint256)","transferOwnership(address)","transferOwnership(address)","transferOwnership(address)","_setTimelocksAndAdmin(address,address,address)"],"calldatas":["0x","0x000000000000000000000000dd1492570beb290a2f309541e1fddcaaa3f00b61","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","0x","0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef71","0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef710000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004f7ba1949c4bf6fb31d","0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef71","0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef71","0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef71","0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef710000000000000000000000000bc3807ec262cb779b38d65b38158acc3bfede10000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef71"],"startBlock":17862241,"endBlock":17898241,"description":"# Nouns DAO V3 upgrade, including Nouns Fork\n\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal upgrades the Nouns DAO logic contract to V3. This version introduces the following changes:\n\n\n1. Proposal editing: adding a new initial state to the proposal lifecycle: “Updatable”, during which proposers can update their proposal's transactions and text description. \n    * This feature will be disabled at first and will require a separate proposal to configure the period of the Updatable state.\n2. Propose by signatures: allowing Nouners and delegates to pool their voting power towards submitting a proposal, by submitting their signature, instead of the current approach where sponsors must delegate their votes to help a proposer achieve threshold.\n    * This feature will be activated once this proposal executes.\n3. Objection-only period: a conditional voting period that gets activated upon a “last-minute” proposal swing from defeated to successful, affording voters more reaction time. Only against votes are possible during the objection period.\n    * This feature will be disabled at first and will require a separate proposal to enable it and configure its parameters.\n4. Votes snapshot after voting delay: moving votes snapshot up, to provide Nouners with reaction time per proposal, to get their votes ready (e.g. some might want to move their delegations around). Currently the vote snapshot block is the proposal creation block.\n5. Nouns Fork: allowing Nouners to exit the DAO by forking to a new DAO. Current threshold is set at 20%. For more details please read [the tech spec](https://github.com/verbsteam/nouns-fork-spec/blob/main/spec.md) and [this post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/iN0FKOn_oYVBzlJkwPwK2mhzaeL8K2-W80u82F7fHj8).\n\nAn updated version of nouns.wtf will be deployed to add support for these features.\n\n\n## Audit\n\nThe DAO funded two audits for this version, first with Spearbit and then with code4rena.\nBelow is a summary of the results with links to the reports.\n\nPlease reach out to us (verbs team) if you have any questions regarding the findings.\n\nSpearbit found:\n* 0 critical risk severity issues\n* 2 high risk severity issues\n* 18 medium risk severity issues\n* 22 low risk severity issues\n\nFor more info: [the full Spearbit audit report](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/d417586ae46f8d32801a3028c2c3496b119fc032/packages/nouns-contracts/audits/dao%20v3%20-%20spearbit%20audit%20report.pdf).\n\ncode4rena found:\n* 1 high risk finding\n* 3 medium risk findings\n* 8 low risk findings\n\nFor more info: [the full code4rena audit report](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-07-nounsdao). \n\n\n### Won’t Fix Issues\n\nThere were some issues we chose to not fix despite agreeing they were good findings, because we wanted to avoid adding further risk or time delays. We’re listing those here explicitly for the sake of max transparency. There were other issues we did not fix because we disagreed with the auditors’ analysis, and those are not listed here.\n\n\n\n* [Setting a new fork escrow contract might lead to lost tokens](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/issues/765)\n* [Proposals can move from Expired state back to Queued when timelock’s Grace Period changes](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/issues/764)\n\n\n## Changes in detail\n\n\n### Proposal editing\n\nProposals get voter feedback almost entirely only once they are onchain. At the same time, proposers are reluctant to cancel and resubmit their proposals for multiple reasons, e.g. prefering to avoid restarting the proposal lifecycle and thus delay funding.\n\nThere have been cases where proposers made promises offchain, e.g. to return part of the funds, but that is not captured onchain, and not visible to the entire voter base.\n\nThis feature introduces a new state into the proposal lifecycle:\n\n```\nUpdatable (new) → Pending → Active …\n```\n\nDuring the Updatable state, a proposer can update their proposal’s description and/or transactions. Following the Updatable state, there’s a Pending state during which updates are no longer available before voting starts during the Active state.\n\nThe length of the Updatable state is configurable by the DAO, and starts at zero. This effectively keeps the feature disabled. A separate proposal will follow with proposed periods for the state, for example: Updatable: 5 days, Pending: 1 day\n\nThere’s also an onchain method of providing feedback to proposals while they are in the Updatable state.\n\n\n### Propose by signatures\n\n_Proposal threshold_ is the number of votes an account must control in order to submit a proposal. As of this writing an account must have at least 2 votes to pass the threshold.\n\nCurrent methods of sponsoring a proposal and their problems:\n\nNouners today either delegate their Nouns to proposers or submit the proposal on their behalf.\nDelegating is limited to Nouners, since delegates can re-delegate their vote to another account.\nWhen a Nouner delegates, they can’t use their voting power for the length of the proposal lifecycle which is very inconvenient.\n\nIf a Nouner/delegate chooses to submit a proposal on behalf of the proposer, we lose the meaning of who is the actual proposer and also the process itself can be cumbersome where the delegate needs to make sure the proposal looks good and pay gas for it.\n\nThis upgrade introduces a new function to the DAO contract: `proposeBySigs`.\nThis allows anyone to submit a proposal and a set of signatures. The signatures are provided by voters and need to match the proposal content. If the sum of votes from all the signers surpasses proposal threshold, the proposal can be submitted.\n\nThe goal is to open another channel through which proposers can submit proposals, without necessarily finding a sponsor through private channels.\n\nVoters can only be signers if they don’t currently have an active proposal, either as a proposer or signer. Signers of a proposal can cancel it at any time, and the same is true for proposers; proposers should choose their signers carefully.\n\nThis allows both Nouners and delegates to “sign-off” on a proposal, while the proposer address remains the actual proposer and without the need to change delegations.\nIt also allows pooling voting power, e.g. two delegates with 1 vote each can sign a proposal in order for it to pass the proposal threshold, currently at 2 votes.\nIt also opens the door to raising the proposal threshold since it’s easier to collect voting power.\n\nAs part of this update we are adding support for “proposal candidates” to nouns.wtf, where proposers can submit their proposals and request signatures. In order to prevent spam, creating a candidate proposal requires either holding 1 vote or sending 0.1 ETH (the ETH recipient and the amount are configurable by the DAO).\nThe candidate proposals data are submitted to a side contract to make this data publicly available for any frontend to interact with.\n\n\n### Objection-only period\n\nThe goal is to protect the DAO from executing proposals that the majority would not want to execute. The threat is one where a minority trying to pass a proposal can let the proposal look like it's failing, to cultivate voter apathy, then cast many of their For votes just before voting ends, swinging the proposal from defeated to successful, leaving the majority wishing they were more vigilant.\n\nThis upgrade introduces a new state in the proposal lifecycle: `ObjectionPeriod`.\n\n``` \\\n… Active (regular voting period) → ObjectionPeriod (conditional) → Succeeded / Defeated \\\n```\n\nObjectionPeriod gets turned on only if a proposal turns from not passing to passing close enough to the end of the voting period.\n\nDuring the `ObjectionPeriod` state, only voters who haven’t voted yet are allowed to vote, but only _against_ the proposal.\n\nQ: Why not allow voting For a proposal during this extra voting period?\nA: Similar to the attack scenario described above, it would still allow voters to keep their votes to themselves and vote only at the last minute. In this case it would be right before the ObjectionPeriod ends.\n\nMore broadly speaking, the risk that a proposal passes when it shouldn’t, is much higher than the risk of a proposal not passing when it should.\nA proposal can be re-proposed, but a proposal that passes can’t be reversed.\n\nDAO configurable parameters:\n1. `objectionPeriodDurationInBlocks`: how long the objection period lasts, e.g. 2 days\n2. `lastMinuteWindowInBlocks`: what is considered “last minute”? e.g. 2 hours\n\nBoth parameters start with values of zero, effectively making this feature disabled. A separate proposal will follow turning on this feature with suggested parameters.\n\n\n### Votes Snapshot After Voting Delay\n\nThe current DAO implementation takes a snapshot of votes & delegation at the block a proposal is created, meaning Nouners have no lead time to put their votes in order, e.g. moving their delegations back to themselves to vote on something they really care about.\n\nThis upgrade changes the snapshot to be after the voting delay, i.e. once voting starts. Nouners will now have the duration of voting delay to transfer, buy, sell, delegate and undelegate their votes.\n\nBecause the nouns supply grows during the voting delay, nouns that are minted during the voting delay also participate in voting. Originally the snapshot was taken during proposal creation in order to align the total supply and the quorum and proposal calculations, which are performed at proposal creation time. Now that the supply has grown, this inconsistency is insignificant.\n\n\n### Nouns Fork\n\nFurther details can be found here in [the tech spec](https://github.com/verbsteam/nouns-fork-spec/blob/main/spec.md) and [this post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/iN0FKOn_oYVBzlJkwPwK2mhzaeL8K2-W80u82F7fHj8).\n\n\n### New treasury\n\nThe DAO fork feature requires switching to a new treasury contract which allows the DAO to transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens when a fork executes. The current treasury (treasury v1) contract is not upgradable, so it requires a migration to a new one. The new treasury (treasury v2), deployed at [0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71), adds the new functions to the existing contract, and is upgradable to avoid the need for migrations in the future.\n\nThe migration includes:\n\n1. Transferring ETH, stETH, wstETH, rETH & USDC\n2. Changing ownership of the auction house, auction house proxy admin, nouns token & nouns descriptor contracts\n3. Change ownership of TokenBuyer and Payer to allow treasury v2 to perform ETH/USDC swaps\n4. Approve the treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\n\nOther assets in treasury v1 can be moved or approved to be moved in follow up proposals. Only assets in treasury v2 are included in the treasury forking in case of a fork.\n\nDAO proposals are limited to 10 transactions, therefore we are doing the migration in two steps. There will be a follow up proposal with the second part of the migration. The follow up proposal will go onchain once this one executes.\n\nThe DAO will still have access to the original treasury (treasury v1), by proposing proposals via the `proposeOnTimelockV1` function.\n\nExisting streams created by the DAO will remain controlled by treasury v1. If the DAO chooses to cancel them, the `proposeOnTimelockV1` function will need to be used.\n\n\n## Important heads up\n\n**Proposals that are queued but not yet executed before this proposal executes will need to be executed using the `executeOnTimelockV1` function. The regular `execute` function will attempt to execute via treasury v2 and will fail.**\n\n\n## Proposal #1 Transactions (this proposal):\n1. Send 2,500 ETH to new treasury contract \\\nThe rest of the ETH will be transferred in a followup proposal. We can’t tell in advance how much ETH the treasury will have at the moment this proposal executes so we are sending a first chunk now.\n2. Upgrade the DAO contract logic to V3\n3. Set the fork params:\n    a. forkEscrow: the escrow contract\n    b. forkDeployer: the contract which deploys new forked DAOs\n    c. erc20TokensToIncludeInFork: addresses of erc20 tokens which will be included in the treasury fork, specifically: stETH, wstETH, rETH and USDC\n    d. forkPeriod: the period during which token holders can join a fork after it has been executed, 7 days\n    e. forkThresholdBPS: the % of nouns required to surpass in order to activate a fork, 2,000 bps = 20%\n4. Set the proposal id at which the vote snapshot will be changed to be after voting delay\n    a. Sets it to the next proposal after the current one\n5. Transfer ownership of the auction house proxy contract\n6. Send stETH to the new treasury, leaving 1,000 stETH for proposals that may be queued\n7. Change ownership of the Nouns token contract\n8. Change ownership of the Nouns descriptor contract\n9. Transfer ownership of the auction house proxy admin\n10. Set treasury V2 as the new treasury of the DAO contract, and set treasury v1 to be available to reference for `proposeOnTimelockV1`\n\n\n## Proposal #2 Transactions:\n\n**This proposal will be submitted only after the first one executes, since only then we will know the final amount of ETH in treasury V1 to transfer as part of this proposal.**\n\n1. Move leftover ETH from treasury v1 to treasury v2\n2. Approve treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\n3. Transfer ownership of TokenBuyer to treasury v2\n4. Transfer ownership of Payer to treasury v2\n5. Approve unlimited stETH to be transferred by the ERC20Transferer contract\n6. Invoke ERC20Transferer to send remaining stETH to the new treasury\n7.

This version introduces the following changes:\n\n\n1. Proposal editing: adding a new initial state to the proposal lifecycle: “Updatable”, during which proposers can update their proposal's transactions and text description. \n    * This feature will be disabled at first and will require a separate proposal to configure the period of the Updatable state.\n2. Propose by signatures: allowing Nouners and delegates to pool their voting power towards submitting a proposal, by submitting their signature, instead of the current approach where sponsors must delegate their votes to help a proposer achieve threshold.\n    * This feature will be activated once this proposal executes.\n3. Objection-only period: a conditional voting period that gets activated upon a “last-minute” proposal swing from defeated to successful, affording voters more reaction time. Only against votes are possible during the objection period.\n    * This feature will be disabled at first and will require a separate proposal to enable it and configure its parameters.\n4. Votes snapshot after voting delay: moving votes snapshot up, to provide Nouners with reaction time per proposal, to get their votes ready (e.g. some might want to move their delegations around). Currently the vote snapshot block is the proposal creation block.\n5. Nouns Fork: allowing Nouners to exit the DAO by forking to a new DAO. Current threshold is set at 20%. For more details please read [the tech spec](https://github.com/verbsteam/nouns-fork-spec/blob/main/spec.md) and [this post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/iN0FKOn_oYVBzlJkwPwK2mhzaeL8K2-W80u82F7fHj8).\n\nAn updated version of nouns.wtf will be deployed to add support for these features.\n\n\n## Audit\n\nThe DAO funded two audits for this version, first with Spearbit and then with code4rena.\nBelow is a summary of the results with links to the reports.\n\nPlease reach out to us (verbs team) if you have any questions regarding the findings.\n\nSpearbit found:\n* 0 critical risk severity issues\n* 2 high risk severity issues\n* 18 medium risk severity issues\n* 22 low risk severity issues\n\nFor more info: [the full Spearbit audit report](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/d417586ae46f8d32801a3028c2c3496b119fc032/packages/nouns-contracts/audits/dao%20v3%20-%20spearbit%20audit%20report.pdf).\n\ncode4rena found:\n* 1 high risk finding\n* 3 medium risk findings\n* 8 low risk findings\n\nFor more info: [the full code4rena audit report](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-07-nounsdao). \n\n\n### Won’t Fix Issues\n\nThere were some issues we chose to not fix despite agreeing they were good findings, because we wanted to avoid adding further risk or time delays. We’re listing those here explicitly for the sake of max transparency. There were other issues we did not fix because we disagreed with the auditors’ analysis, and those are not listed here.\n\n\n\n* [Setting a new fork escrow contract might lead to lost tokens](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/issues/765)\n* [Proposals can move from Expired state back to Queued when timelock’s Grace Period changes](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/issues/764)\n\n\n## Changes in detail\n\n\n### Proposal editing\n\nProposals get voter feedback almost entirely only once they are onchain. At the same time, proposers are reluctant to cancel and resubmit their proposals for multiple reasons, e.g. prefering to avoid restarting the proposal lifecycle and thus delay funding.\n\nThere have been cases where proposers made promises offchain, e.g. to return part of the funds, but that is not captured onchain, and not visible to the entire voter base.\n\nThis feature introduces a new state into the proposal lifecycle:\n\n```\nUpdatable (new) → Pending → Active …\n```\n\nDuring the Updatable state, a proposer can update their proposal’s description and/or transactions. Following the Updatable state, there’s a Pending state during which updates are no longer available before voting starts during the Active state.\n\nThe length of the Updatable state is configurable by the DAO, and starts at zero. This effectively keeps the feature disabled. A separate proposal will follow with proposed periods for the state, for example: Updatable: 5 days, Pending: 1 day\n\nThere’s also an onchain method of providing feedback to proposals while they are in the Updatable state.\n\n\n### Propose by signatures\n\n_Proposal threshold_ is the number of votes an account must control in order to submit a proposal. As of this writing an account must have at least 2 votes to pass the threshold.\n\nCurrent methods of sponsoring a proposal and their problems:\n\nNouners today either delegate their Nouns to proposers or submit the proposal on their behalf.\nDelegating is limited to Nouners, since delegates can re-delegate their vote to another account.\nWhen a Nouner delegates, they can’t use their voting power for the length of the proposal lifecycle which is very inconvenient.\n\nIf a Nouner/delegate chooses to submit a proposal on behalf of the proposer, we lose the meaning of who is the actual proposer and also the process itself can be cumbersome where the delegate needs to make sure the proposal looks good and pay gas for it.\n\nThis upgrade introduces a new function to the DAO contract: `proposeBySigs`.\nThis allows anyone to submit a proposal and a set of signatures. The signatures are provided by voters and need to match the proposal content. If the sum of votes from all the signers surpasses proposal threshold, the proposal can be submitted.\n\nThe goal is to open another channel through which proposers can submit proposals, without necessarily finding a sponsor through private channels.\n\nVoters can only be signers if they don’t currently have an active proposal, either as a proposer or signer. Signers of a proposal can cancel it at any time, and the same is true for proposers; proposers should choose their signers carefully.\n\nThis allows both Nouners and delegates to “sign-off” on a proposal, while the proposer address remains the actual proposer and without the need to change delegations.\nIt also allows pooling voting power, e.g. two delegates with 1 vote each can sign a proposal in order for it to pass the proposal threshold, currently at 2 votes.\nIt also opens the door to raising the proposal threshold since it’s easier to collect voting power.\n\nAs part of this update we are adding support for “proposal candidates” to nouns.wtf, where proposers can submit their proposals and request signatures. In order to prevent spam, creating a candidate proposal requires either holding 1 vote or sending 0.1 ETH (the ETH recipient and the amount are configurable by the DAO).\nThe candidate proposals data are submitted to a side contract to make this data publicly available for any frontend to interact with.\n\n\n### Objection-only period\n\nThe goal is to protect the DAO from executing proposals that the majority would not want to execute. The threat is one where a minority trying to pass a proposal can let the proposal look like it's failing, to cultivate voter apathy, then cast many of their For votes just before voting ends, swinging the proposal from defeated to successful, leaving the majority wishing they were more vigilant.\n\nThis upgrade introduces a new state in the proposal lifecycle: `ObjectionPeriod`.\n\n``` \\\n… Active (regular voting period) → ObjectionPeriod (conditional) → Succeeded / Defeated \\\n```\n\nObjectionPeriod gets turned on only if a proposal turns from not passing to passing close enough to the end of the voting period.\n\nDuring the `ObjectionPeriod` state, only voters who haven’t voted yet are allowed to vote, but only _against_ the proposal.\n\nQ: Why not allow voting For a proposal during this extra voting period?\nA: Similar to the attack scenario described above, it would still allow voters to keep their votes to themselves and vote only at the last minute. In this case it would be right before the ObjectionPeriod ends.\n\nMore broadly speaking, the risk that a proposal passes when it shouldn’t, is much higher than the risk of a proposal not passing when it should.\nA proposal can be re-proposed, but a proposal that passes can’t be reversed.\n\nDAO configurable parameters:\n1. `objectionPeriodDurationInBlocks`: how long the objection period lasts, e.g. 2 days\n2. `lastMinuteWindowInBlocks`: what is considered “last minute”? e.g. 2 hours\n\nBoth parameters start with values of zero, effectively making this feature disabled. A separate proposal will follow turning on this feature with suggested parameters.\n\n\n### Votes Snapshot After Voting Delay\n\nThe current DAO implementation takes a snapshot of votes & delegation at the block a proposal is created, meaning Nouners have no lead time to put their votes in order, e.g. moving their delegations back to themselves to vote on something they really care about.\n\nThis upgrade changes the snapshot to be after the voting delay, i.e. once voting starts. Nouners will now have the duration of voting delay to transfer, buy, sell, delegate and undelegate their votes.\n\nBecause the nouns supply grows during the voting delay, nouns that are minted during the voting delay also participate in voting. Originally the snapshot was taken during proposal creation in order to align the total supply and the quorum and proposal calculations, which are performed at proposal creation time. Now that the supply has grown, this inconsistency is insignificant.\n\n\n### Nouns Fork\n\nFurther details can be found here in [the tech spec](https://github.com/verbsteam/nouns-fork-spec/blob/main/spec.md) and [this post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/iN0FKOn_oYVBzlJkwPwK2mhzaeL8K2-W80u82F7fHj8).\n\n\n### New treasury\n\nThe DAO fork feature requires switching to a new treasury contract which allows the DAO to transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens when a fork executes. The current treasury (treasury v1) contract is not upgradable, so it requires a migration to a new one. The new treasury (treasury v2), deployed at [0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71), adds the new functions to the existing contract, and is upgradable to avoid the need for migrations in the future.\n\nThe migration includes:\n\n1. Transferring ETH, stETH, wstETH, rETH & USDC\n2. Changing ownership of the auction house, auction house proxy admin, nouns token & nouns descriptor contracts\n3. Change ownership of TokenBuyer and Payer to allow treasury v2 to perform ETH/USDC swaps\n4. Approve the treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\n\nOther assets in treasury v1 can be moved or approved to be moved in follow up proposals. Only assets in treasury v2 are included in the treasury forking in case of a fork.\n\nDAO proposals are limited to 10 transactions, therefore we are doing the migration in two steps. There will be a follow up proposal with the second part of the migration. The follow up proposal will go onchain once this one executes.\n\nThe DAO will still have access to the original treasury (treasury v1), by proposing proposals via the `proposeOnTimelockV1` function.\n\nExisting streams created by the DAO will remain controlled by treasury v1. If the DAO chooses to cancel them, the `proposeOnTimelockV1` function will need to be used.\n\n\n## Important heads up\n\n**Proposals that are queued but not yet executed before this proposal executes will need to be executed using the `executeOnTimelockV1` function. The regular `execute` function will attempt to execute via treasury v2 and will fail.**\n\n\n## Proposal #1 Transactions (this proposal):\n1. Send 2,500 ETH to new treasury contract \\\nThe rest of the ETH will be transferred in a followup proposal. We can’t tell in advance how much ETH the treasury will have at the moment this proposal executes so we are sending a first chunk now.\n2. Upgrade the DAO contract logic to V3\n3. Set the fork params:\n    a. forkEscrow: the escrow contract\n    b. forkDeployer: the contract which deploys new forked DAOs\n    c. erc20TokensToIncludeInFork: addresses of erc20 tokens which will be included in the treasury fork, specifically: stETH, wstETH, rETH and USDC\n    d. forkPeriod: the period during which token holders can join a fork after it has been executed, 7 days\n    e. forkThresholdBPS: the % of nouns required to surpass in order to activate a fork, 2,000 bps = 20%\n4. Set the proposal id at which the vote snapshot will be changed to be after voting delay\n    a. Sets it to the next proposal after the current one\n5. Transfer ownership of the auction house proxy contract\n6. Send stETH to the new treasury, leaving 5,000 stETH for proposals that may be queued\n7. Change ownership of the Nouns token contract\n8. Change ownership of the Nouns descriptor contract\n9. Transfer ownership of the auction house proxy admin\n10. Set treasury V2 as the new treasury of the DAO contract, and set treasury v1 to be available to reference for `proposeOnTimelockV1`\n\n\n## Proposal #2 Transactions:\n\n**This proposal will be submitted only after the first one executes, since only then we will know the final amount of ETH in treasury V1 to transfer as part of this proposal.**\n\n1. Move leftover ETH from treasury v1 to treasury v2\n2. Approve treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\n3. Transfer ownership of TokenBuyer to treasury v2\n4. Transfer ownership of Payer to treasury v2\n5. Approve unlimited stETH to be transferred by the ERC20Transferer contract\n6. Invoke ERC20Transferer to send remaining stETH to the new treasury\n7. Transfer all wstETH to treasury v2\n8. Transfer all rETH to treasury v2\n9. Transfer all USDC to treasury v2\n\nCan be viewed in more detail [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/9cbc7dde418d5ba7a1b50d0b0348dd14b6191404/packages/nouns-contracts/script/ProposeTimelockMigrationCleanupMainnet.s.sol).\n\n\n## Proposal #3 Transactions:\n\n1.

The workshops were:\n1. Crash course on Web3 for non-profit organisations\n2. Using Web3 for NPOs - when, where, how?\n3. Hands-on workshop - setting up an ENS, demo on QF with clrfund\n4. Road to Ethereum SG: Defining Challenge Statements\n\nThe final workshop led to challenge statements being generated for Ethereum Singapore. Furthermore, this process will be thoroughly documented and disseminated as an **open-source playbook**, serving as a public good empowering other communities globally where they are able to freely utilize the hackathon format as a guide.\n\nAt Ethereum Singapore, we are breaking from the norm of using booths to showcase Nouns. Instead, the **entire venue** will be transformed into an **immersive playground for Nouns**, allowing event guests to fully engage with the world of Nouns throughout their visit. This fresh approach offers abundant photo opportunities and generates brand awareness as well as online attention as guests share their experiences on social media. We will feature Nouns as much as possible during the event including speaking and physical activations.\n\nWhat to expect:\n- 3D Nouns models all around the venue (ref.

Run with Nouns Running Club**\n\nThe [Nouns Running Club](https://twitter.com/nounsrc) supports this proposal as it fosters a positive sum game by encouraging collaboration and growth. We are thrilled to share that the club has already initiated the planning of an official run alongside Ethereum Singapore. With the successful passing of this proposition, we believe that it will make a substantial contribution to the widespread adoption & visibility to Nouns Running Club powered by Nouns.  \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy79V8Rqh.png)\n\n# **Total = 27,600 USDC** to be sent to [ethereumsingapore.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/ethereumsingapore.eth)\n\n# **Motivation for Nouns to be at Ethereum Singapore**\n## 1. In true Nounish spirit, it is focused on public goods & non-profits\nThe spirit of bringing Web3 to enable real impact **deeply resonates with Nouns ethos**, where the very first proposal ever passed on NounsDAO was to [\"Donate 5 ETH each to 6 charities\"](https://nouns.wtf/vote/1) and also produced [public good structure like prop house to empower builders](https://nouns.center/funding). \n\nSimilarly at Ethereum Singapore we shared the same vision featuring a hackathon for good where the challenge statements will be [collaboratively developed](https://twitter.com/ethereum_sg/status/1676447827353018369?s=20) with local *charities and non-profit organizations* that have an interest in web3 technologies. Our collaborating partner [National Volunteer and Philantrophy Centre](https://cityofgood.sg/) which stewards the vision of making Singapore a City of Good will be working with thousands of local charities and non-profits engaging up to **50+ organisations at the leadership level** to educate them about blockchain technology bringing Web3 to them.   \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ7euU2c2.png)\n\n## 2. Southeast Asia presence + Devcon2024 will be in this region!\nThe team also aims to leverage this opportunity to effectively introduce Nouns to the local communities with the assistance of [@nounsinsg](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg), fostering greater awareness and comprehension of Nouns while leaving a memorable impact on Singapore, the blockchain hub of Southeast Asia.\nLooking ahead, all eyes will be on Southeast Asia as [Devcon is set to come the region](https://twitter.com/EFDevcon/status/1630543172974657538?cxt=HHwWhIC-gY-Y7aAtAAAA). Ethereum Singapore has [committed to dedicate its excess funds](https://mirror.xyz/ethereumsingapore.eth/MyMITRe0nHv1iqjx3jNxZtaq4M5d37wstODRkUCw-9k) to support local developers, events, education initiatves, and meaningful public goods for the region and hopes to set a new cultural norm for Ethereum events.\n\n## 3. A Nounish gathering point for our community\nEthereum Singapore is [held during F1 week](https://www.panewslab.com/zh_hk/token2049sideevents/index.html) which numerous events such as Token2049, Filecoin Summit, Froyoverse, NFT Asia, Milken Institute Asia Summit, and many more are held. Amidst the hectic non-stop event schedule, Nouns holders can feel at home at Ethereum Singapore with like-minded friends and our adopted web3 family members. The wider public interested in web3 can also learn about what we're all about and perhaps their first web3 interaction would be with a Nounish artifact!\n\n# **Executing Personnel:**\n[QZ:](https://twitter.com/not_qz) Main organiser and [meetup lead](https://www.meetup.com/ethereum-singapore/) for Ethereum Singapore.

This prop is a statement of resilience, a pledge that will not be broken or **canceled**.\n\nFinalized with meticulous care between January and February, V3's design stands unchanged. The community, blindsided by the spontaneous cancellation despite comprehensive legal opinions and exhaustive audits, remains united and vigilant. Claims of a \"crypto-economic issue\" find no echo among the community, auditors, Cayman Foundation's law firm, or the CT community at large. Yet, we should all stand ready for open discourse within the five days before this prop goes live. **This prop will not be canceled.** The community alone will decide, again.\n\nThis proposal symbolizes something profound. It is the very test of whether Nouns is controlled by the collective strength and wisdom of the community/token holders or controlled by a select few known as the Nounders/multisig holders. This is a moment that challenges us to prove our shared principles and uphold true decentralization while leading the ecosystm forward into a new more resilient future.\n\n\n------------------------- Below should be identical to the last prop. Please Verify -------------------------\n\n# Edit: changing stETH transfer (tx #6) to a lower amount in case proposal 352 passes\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal upgrades the Nouns DAO logic contract to V3. This version introduces the following changes:\n\nProposal editing: adding a new initial state to the proposal lifecycle: “Updatable”, during which proposers can update their proposal's transactions and text description.\nThis feature will be disabled at first and will require a separate proposal to configure the period of the Updatable state.\nPropose by signatures: allowing Nouners and delegates to pool their voting power towards submitting a proposal, by submitting their signature, instead of the current approach where sponsors must delegate their votes to help a proposer achieve threshold.\nThis feature will be activated once this proposal executes.\nObjection-only period: a conditional voting period that gets activated upon a “last-minute” proposal swing from defeated to successful, affording voters more reaction time. Only against votes are possible during the objection period.\nThis feature will be disabled at first and will require a separate proposal to enable it and configure its parameters.\nVotes snapshot after voting delay: moving votes snapshot up, to provide Nouners with reaction time per proposal, to get their votes ready (e.g. some might want to move their delegations around). Currently the vote snapshot block is the proposal creation block.\nNouns Fork: allowing Nouners to exit the DAO by forking to a new DAO. Current threshold is set at 20%. For more details please read the tech spec and this post.\nAn updated version of nouns.wtf will be deployed to add support for these features.\n\nAudit\nThe DAO funded two audits for this version, first with Spearbit and then with code4rena.\nBelow is a summary of the results with links to the reports.\n\nPlease reach out to us (verbs team) if you have any questions regarding the findings.\n\nSpearbit found:\n\n0 critical risk severity issues\n2 high risk severity issues\n18 medium risk severity issues\n22 low risk severity issues\nFor more info: the full Spearbit audit report.\n\ncode4rena found:\n\n1 high risk finding\n3 medium risk findings\n8 low risk findings\nFor more info: the full code4rena audit report.\n\nWon’t Fix Issues\nThere were some issues we chose to not fix despite agreeing they were good findings, because we wanted to avoid adding further risk or time delays. We’re listing those here explicitly for the sake of max transparency. There were other issues we did not fix because we disagreed with the auditors’ analysis, and those are not listed here.\n\nSetting a new fork escrow contract might lead to lost tokens\nProposals can move from Expired state back to Queued when timelock’s Grace Period changes\nChanges in detail\nProposal editing\nProposals get voter feedback almost entirely only once they are onchain. At the same time, proposers are reluctant to cancel and resubmit their proposals for multiple reasons, e.g. prefering to avoid restarting the proposal lifecycle and thus delay funding.\n\nThere have been cases where proposers made promises offchain, e.g. to return part of the funds, but that is not captured onchain, and not visible to the entire voter base.\n\nThis feature introduces a new state into the proposal lifecycle:\n\nUpdatable (new) → Pending → Active …\nDuring the Updatable state, a proposer can update their proposal’s description and/or transactions. Following the Updatable state, there’s a Pending state during which updates are no longer available before voting starts during the Active state.\n\nThe length of the Updatable state is configurable by the DAO, and starts at zero. This effectively keeps the feature disabled. A separate proposal will follow with proposed periods for the state, for example: Updatable: 5 days, Pending: 1 day\n\nThere’s also an onchain method of providing feedback to proposals while they are in the Updatable state.\n\nPropose by signatures\nProposal threshold is the number of votes an account must control in order to submit a proposal. As of this writing an account must have at least 2 votes to pass the threshold.\n\nCurrent methods of sponsoring a proposal and their problems:\n\nNouners today either delegate their Nouns to proposers or submit the proposal on their behalf.\nDelegating is limited to Nouners, since delegates can re-delegate their vote to another account.\nWhen a Nouner delegates, they can’t use their voting power for the length of the proposal lifecycle which is very inconvenient.\n\nIf a Nouner/delegate chooses to submit a proposal on behalf of the proposer, we lose the meaning of who is the actual proposer and also the process itself can be cumbersome where the delegate needs to make sure the proposal looks good and pay gas for it.\n\nThis upgrade introduces a new function to the DAO contract: proposeBySigs.\nThis allows anyone to submit a proposal and a set of signatures. The signatures are provided by voters and need to match the proposal content. If the sum of votes from all the signers surpasses proposal threshold, the proposal can be submitted.\n\nThe goal is to open another channel through which proposers can submit proposals, without necessarily finding a sponsor through private channels.\n\nVoters can only be signers if they don’t currently have an active proposal, either as a proposer or signer. Signers of a proposal can cancel it at any time, and the same is true for proposers; proposers should choose their signers carefully.\n\nThis allows both Nouners and delegates to “sign-off” on a proposal, while the proposer address remains the actual proposer and without the need to change delegations.\nIt also allows pooling voting power, e.g. two delegates with 1 vote each can sign a proposal in order for it to pass the proposal threshold, currently at 2 votes.\nIt also opens the door to raising the proposal threshold since it’s easier to collect voting power.\n\nAs part of this update we are adding support for “proposal candidates” to nouns.wtf, where proposers can submit their proposals and request signatures. In order to prevent spam, creating a candidate proposal requires either holding 1 vote or sending 0.1 ETH (the ETH recipient and the amount are configurable by the DAO).\nThe candidate proposals data are submitted to a side contract to make this data publicly available for any frontend to interact with.\n\nObjection-only period\nThe goal is to protect the DAO from executing proposals that the majority would not want to execute. The threat is one where a minority trying to pass a proposal can let the proposal look like it's failing, to cultivate voter apathy, then cast many of their For votes just before voting ends, swinging the proposal from defeated to successful, leaving the majority wishing they were more vigilant.\n\nThis upgrade introduces a new state in the proposal lifecycle: ObjectionPeriod.\n\n… Active (regular voting period) → ObjectionPeriod (conditional) → Succeeded / Defeated \\\nObjectionPeriod gets turned on only if a proposal turns from not passing to passing close enough to the end of the voting period.\n\nDuring the ObjectionPeriod state, only voters who haven’t voted yet are allowed to vote, but only against the proposal.\n\nQ: Why not allow voting For a proposal during this extra voting period?\nA: Similar to the attack scenario described above, it would still allow voters to keep their votes to themselves and vote only at the last minute. In this case it would be right before the ObjectionPeriod ends.\n\nMore broadly speaking, the risk that a proposal passes when it shouldn’t, is much higher than the risk of a proposal not passing when it should.\nA proposal can be re-proposed, but a proposal that passes can’t be reversed.\n\nDAO configurable parameters:\n\nobjectionPeriodDurationInBlocks: how long the objection period lasts, e.g. 2 days\nlastMinuteWindowInBlocks: what is considered “last minute”? e.g. 2 hours\nBoth parameters start with values of zero, effectively making this feature disabled. A separate proposal will follow turning on this feature with suggested parameters.\n\nVotes Snapshot After Voting Delay\nThe current DAO implementation takes a snapshot of votes & delegation at the block a proposal is created, meaning Nouners have no lead time to put their votes in order, e.g. moving their delegations back to themselves to vote on something they really care about.\n\nThis upgrade changes the snapshot to be after the voting delay, i.e. once voting starts. Nouners will now have the duration of voting delay to transfer, buy, sell, delegate and undelegate their votes.\n\nBecause the nouns supply grows during the voting delay, nouns that are minted during the voting delay also participate in voting. Originally the snapshot was taken during proposal creation in order to align the total supply and the quorum and proposal calculations, which are performed at proposal creation time. Now that the supply has grown, this inconsistency is insignificant.\n\nNouns Fork\nFurther details can be found here in the tech spec and this post.\n\nNew treasury\nThe DAO fork feature requires switching to a new treasury contract which allows the DAO to transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens when a fork executes. The current treasury (treasury v1) contract is not upgradable, so it requires a migration to a new one. The new treasury (treasury v2), deployed at 0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71, adds the new functions to the existing contract, and is upgradable to avoid the need for migrations in the future.\n\nThe migration includes:\n\nTransferring ETH, stETH, wstETH, rETH & USDC\nChanging ownership of the auction house, auction house proxy admin, nouns token & nouns descriptor contracts\nChange ownership of TokenBuyer and Payer to allow treasury v2 to perform ETH/USDC swaps\nApprove the treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\nOther assets in treasury v1 can be moved or approved to be moved in follow up proposals. Only assets in treasury v2 are included in the treasury forking in case of a fork.\n\nDAO proposals are limited to 10 transactions, therefore we are doing the migration in two steps. There will be a follow up proposal with the second part of the migration. The follow up proposal will go onchain once this one executes.\n\nThe DAO will still have access to the original treasury (treasury v1), by proposing proposals via the proposeOnTimelockV1 function.\n\nExisting streams created by the DAO will remain controlled by treasury v1. If the DAO chooses to cancel them, the proposeOnTimelockV1 function will need to be used.\n\nImportant heads up\nProposals that are queued but not yet executed before this proposal executes will need to be executed using the executeOnTimelockV1 function. The regular execute function will attempt to execute via treasury v2 and will fail.\n\nProposal #1 Transactions (this proposal):\nSend 2,500 ETH to new treasury contract\nThe rest of the ETH will be transferred in a followup proposal. We can’t tell in advance how much ETH the treasury will have at the moment this proposal executes so we are sending a first chunk now.\nUpgrade the DAO contract logic to V3\nSet the fork params:\na. forkEscrow: the escrow contract\nb. forkDeployer: the contract which deploys new forked DAOs\nc. erc20TokensToIncludeInFork: addresses of erc20 tokens which will be included in the treasury fork, specifically: stETH, wstETH, rETH and USDC\nd. forkPeriod: the period during which token holders can join a fork after it has been executed, 7 days\ne. forkThresholdBPS: the % of nouns required to surpass in order to activate a fork, 2,000 bps = 20%\nSet the proposal id at which the vote snapshot will be changed to be after voting delay\na. Sets it to the next proposal after the current one\nTransfer ownership of the auction house proxy contract\nSend stETH to the new treasury, leaving 5,000 stETH for proposals that may be queued\nChange ownership of the Nouns token contract\nChange ownership of the Nouns descriptor contract\nTransfer ownership of the auction house proxy admin\nSet treasury V2 as the new treasury of the DAO contract, and set treasury v1 to be available to reference for proposeOnTimelockV1\nProposal #2 Transactions:\nThis proposal will be submitted only after the first one executes, since only then we will know the final amount of ETH in treasury V1 to transfer as part of this proposal.\n\nMove leftover ETH from treasury v1 to treasury v2\nApprove treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\nTransfer ownership of TokenBuyer to treasury v2\nTransfer ownership of Payer to treasury v2\nApprove unlimited stETH to be transferred by the ERC20Transferer contract\nInvoke ERC20Transferer to send remaining stETH to the new treasury\nTransfer all wstETH to treasury v2\nTransfer all rETH to treasury v2\nTransfer all USDC to treasury v2\nCan be viewed in more detail here.\n\nProposal #3 Transactions:\nSet

The Nouns in Rio team is requesting **9 ETH + 9,500 USDC** to create an engaging Prop House Experience in a hub brimming with innovators.\n‎ \n## How 👀\n\nWe plan to create a round in the upcoming Nouns in Rio House and open exclusively* to all [Blockchain Rio](https://blockchainfestival.io/) attendees, a place full of builders aspiring to build for the Web3 ecosystem and push the boundaries of innovation.\n\nA pool of 7 ETH will be designated to back 20 projects, each set to receive 0.35 ETH. Proposals must aim to enhance Prop House in some way, whether through community integration, explainer videos, code development, and more. After the event, Nouners will have a one-week voting window to determine which projects get funded.\n\n**During the event, we'll ask builders interested in submitting a proposal to fill out a form. This ensures that all proposals come from verified event participants.*\n‎ \n![](https://i.imgur.com/8kR9fgd.png)  \n‎ \n## Why 🤔\n\nWe want individuals to recognize Prop House as a platform where they can get funding to bring their ideas to life. By showcasing the diverse groups already benefiting from the platform, we aim to inspire them to consider how they can engage their own communities in similar ways.\n\nThe true value of this experience lies not only in funding individual projects but also in connecting talented builders to the Nouns DAO community. By cultivating this relationship, we create a pathway for ongoing collaboration and innovation, encouraging them to continue contributing to and growing with the community.\n\nCheck out all the amazing things that have come from Prop House. **Nouns has funded one of the best Web3 platforms, and it's high time we spread the word about it.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AZR3Lfp.png)\n‎ \n## Where 📍\n\nWe discovered Prop House at an event and from that moment we knew we wanted to create an IRL experience for it. Now, we have the perfect chance. We'll be at the largest Web3 & Business event in Latin America, [Blockchain Rio](https://blockchainfestival.io/), from September 12th to 14th, alongside big names like Polkadot, CoinEx, Polygon, Ledger, and more. It's the ideal place to find passionate builders and introduce them to Prop House.\n\nTake a look at the first edition of the event from 2022, which attracted more than 22,000 visitors, featured 432 speakers, and generated 86 million reais in economic impact for the state of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/CODwQjS.gif)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/l3gsmny.png)\n\n*Brazilian builders on stage talking about Nouns and Prop House. [Watch here!](https://twitter.com/blockchain_rio/status/1630946236105736195)* \n‎ \n## Lounge 🛋️\n\nOur lounge will include two interactive totems that enable attendees to explore Prop House and toggle between different houses and rounds. Additionally, two large TVs will display a video produced by us, highlighting projects funded by various communities through Prop House. The lounge backdrop will offer step-by-step instructions, complete with a QR code, for submitting proposals.\n\nAll of this will support the team in explaining what Prop House is and how it works. We'll also **give a talk** at the event and invite people to join the experience and submit their projects.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ut98dfj.png)\n\n*The layout of the lounge and the art on the backdrop are for illustrative purposes and may not represent the final design.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UNfxWZG.png)\n‎ \n## Team 🤝\n\n[Nouns in Rio](https://twitter.com/NounsInRio) team, represented by [JP](https://twitter.com/home) and [Debinvest](https://twitter.com/debinvest), is behind the project. They will be on-site at the lounge to explain Prop House, discuss the round, and assist with wallet creations and proposal submissions.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9mp1CbE.png)\n\nNouns in Rio team has successfully organized various nounish IRL events, including [Nouns Week](https://nounsweek.wtf/rio-de-janeiro/), the [Treasure Hunt](https://twitter.com/NounsInRio/status/1574418495911219201), [social actions](https://twitter.com/NounsInRio/status/1606765831064588288) for Prop House's Nounish Holidays and many others.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WDTRnam.png)\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/uFXRkNX.gif)\n\n*Nouns Week*\n‎ \n## Budget 💰\n\nWith 7 ETH, we can fund a diverse range of projects with a meaningful ETH value. JP and Debinvest will each receive 1 ETH for managing the project and staffing the lounge during the event. The cost for setting up and operating the event space, which includes event fees and production expenses, will be 9,500 USDC. In case fewer than 20 proposals are submitted, **all remaining ETH will be returned to the DAO.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HqGnVgI.png)\n‎ \n## Success ✨\n\nAfter the event concludes, we'll provide the DAO with both an aftermovie and a detailed report. This report will feature key metrics like site visits during the event (provided by the Prop House team if possible), submitted proposals, QR code scans, and minted POAPs. We'll also extend an invitation to all funded project leads to join the [Nouns in Rio Discord server](https://discord.gg/yBFRt2D894) for ongoing project follow-up, ensuring sustained engagement and support.\n\nTo amplify our impact, we'll actively engage the community through our Portuguese Nounish channels like [@nounsinrio](instagram.com/nounsinrio), [@nounsbr](instagram.com/nounsbr) and [@thenounsquarebr](https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquarebr). The engagement metrics from these channels will be included in our final report.\n\nWe recognize this is a pivotal time for the DAO, but due to the time-sensitive nature of our project, we felt the need to proceed. Thank you for reading and considering this proposal. Let's take Prop House to the streets! 💡\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dAMtste.gif)"},{"blockNumber":18007678,"blockHash":"0x5155ef3de8f6a060374748e4be351cc99dccf88b24695eae684b73fea147a934","transactionIndex":105,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xcd9d8bf04a8655c928cd7400b5140415cabf7b244f5e21e5e08bf56d52b3894e","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":361,"proposer":"0x84044988e0754decAa7444d19c8BF069B977F128","targets":["0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5","0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["withdrawETH()","withdrawPaymentToken()"],"calldatas":["0x","0x"],"startBlock":18043678,"endBlock":18079678,"description":"# Withdraw from the TokenBuyer/Payer contracts\n\nThe treasury assets are currently held by the TokenBuyer/Payer contracts are not included in the forking calculation and in the upcoming Proposal 360 there is a ∼105 ETH refill for the TokenBuyer/Payer which might cause some disagreement just before a possible fork so I propose to withdraw from the 2 contracts.\n\nThe contracts will refill with the first USDC proposal after this one so it wont cause any issues."},{"blockNumber":18014498,"blockHash":"0xff9d7a3b738a35d4d2153bba023d26762eacc29dea5a3a6954b529e862479bcf","transactionIndex":106,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x88e60afd66016ffc2b45f4a5dc5ba498bb84ae34105cb62dd41d8435eb9b671d","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":362,"proposer":"0xd3e2e76e4Ab0322614fe7aaA3be0B04beD83d0D0","targets":["0x0B789Ef2A2cda2fb5B5c7cdB278C2Cb8BdC96e4C"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":18050498,"endBlock":18086498,"description":"# Place Dustin Yellin's Nouns Sculpture at Zero Bond (NYC)\n\nThe DAO recently acquired a Dustin Yellin sculpture (See Proposals 48 and 350).

The expected loan period will be 1-3 years, during which time Dustin Yellin Studio will work on additional loan placements for the work at museums and relevant cultural institutions worldwide.\n\nRelatedly, earlier this month Yellin partnered with OpenSea and Friends With Benefits on an open edition set of NFT's to commemorate the completion of his Nouns sculpture. 15% of the total proceeds from the primary sale - 4.027ETH - have been donated by the artist to the Nouns DAO Treasury: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x40d94b6d84024b4b903b53f3f04238b979645eb8d837eef358820ac9f318eb5b\n\n9 ETH Deposit to Dustin Yellin Studio:\n0x0B789Ef2A2cda2fb5B5c7cdB278C2Cb8BdC96e4C"},{"blockNumber":18085076,"blockHash":"0xe35df2f881a063415e7724da0bb518016b4088ac3108ad064add320f411f992f","transactionIndex":41,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x0434693cc01667023df37523e89147127ecd2961923a838f01767d30db53e60d","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":363,"proposer":"0x0658f4eD17289144717713ADfFC2539eF7c2EF8e","targets":["0xa1B74d2280966A89AC7e0F3A8bc5f0867C776d98"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":18121076,"endBlock":18157076,"description":"# Bring a million shredders onchain\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeie27ufroebf2hzy62q7jrtl32asdn2zaf3lwojrvamsdgcupd2loa)\n\n**[Gnars](https://gnars.wtf)** proposes a strategic migration from Ethereum mainnet to Zora Network in our pursuit to bring a million shredders onchain.

Movements > Marketing.*\n\nSkateboarding and similar subcultures, despite their rise in popularity, grapple with commercial overreach and value retention. Some of the most pressing challenges include:\n\n1. **Commercial Exploitation**: Outside brands jumping into skateboarding often prioritise profit over authenticity.\n2. **Loss of Authenticity**: Many skaters, due to financial pressures, might promote brands they don't genuinely align with.\n3. **Skater Exploitation**: Many skaters, despite their talent, don't receive fair compensation, especially considering the sport's physical demands.\n4. **Mainstream Misrepresentation**: Media portrayals frequently miss the genuine essence of skateboarding, leaning into stereotypes.\n5. **Skatepark Commercialisation**: Once-communal skateparks are becoming increasingly commercialised.\n6. **Core Values vs. Growth**: Balancing foundational skateboarding values with growth opportunities remains a delicate act.\n\nThe skateboarding domain needs a thoughtful equilibrium. Brands that genuinely get and respect the skate culture have the potential to collaboratively benefit both parties without diluting the sport's spirit.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Proposed Solution\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreiflj5bgctvmzjujul3kvehilbgrzcag7zhomomfdtrtbit4sptjym)\n\n📝 *Check out the [Meier Skatepark renovation](https://www.gnars.wtf/dao/proposals/3) proposal that's currently being delivered*\n\nEmpowering individuals to step into the blockchain world is central to our mission. Shredders, akin to artists, can undergo transformative experiences through this. Our overarching goal is to amplify our influence, simplify operational processes, and champion those with genuine grassroots credibility.\n\n**GNARS** as an acronym crystallizes our ethos, mirroring the Nouns' virtuous cycle, acting as our serendipity machine:\n\n- **Goodwill**: Renewing skateparks and introducing new, shred-worthy sculptures\n- **Network**: Culturally sensitive contributions earn us both visibility and respect\n- **Advocacy**: Harmonising with communities helps us draw in new enthusiasts\n- **Releases**: Collective creative outputs with shared proceeds bolster funding\n- **Serendipity**: Getting onchain empowers shredders, opening fresh avenues\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 Opportunity\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreihhjrjim3rtjd6k2drh6r5gpy5i7xfp22gjcuouujecd2p4arkxhq)\n\nOur target of onboarding a million shredders might seem lofty, but it's just a fraction - 0.2% - of the 490 million participants in extreme sports.\n\nTo provide some perspective, skateboarding alone boasts 85 million participants. Industries like adventure tourism further validate our optimistic projections, given their sustained growth trajectories.\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 Approach and Strategy\n\n[![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifkzcdwnvktxhmf47i67iel4gqyqtqc6jkhqc2xfxxqnfnmjr5dja)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3unXaYpMl8)\n\n📝 *Watch this NounGnarversary celebration funded via Prop House [on YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3unXaYpMl8)*\n\nGnars takes pride in our unique, community-focused contributions to skate culture.

Secure permissions for QR/NFC plaques.\n- **Community Consultation**: Prioritise feedback, ensuring final outputs align with community needs and aspirations.\n- **Skateable Art**: Commission designs that are both visually appealing and skateable, enhancing park functionality.\n- **Skate Community Collaborations**: Organise events to spotlight our mission. Rope in local influencers as ambassadors.\n- **Educational Initiatives**: Engage with schools and clubs, emphasising the interplay of art, skateboarding, and community projects.\n- **Media Outreach**: Use local media to showcase project completions and events, underscoring our tech integrations.\n- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Use digital tools to gauge user engagement and gather feedback, refining future strategies.\n\nOur dual focus on the skateboarding community and local councils ensures that our initiatives resonate with authentic cultural value.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Budget Breakdown\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeihebdyhnukubmcxl3tkhlqrn3dzwx5ace6uck2l2cd6ggb6tdq72i)\n\nPer the TLDR, our ask is 200 ETH to our treausury (DAO executor) at `gnars.eth`, outlined as:\n\n- **Continuous park enhancements - 150 ETH**\n    - Skate and other terrain park refurbishments globally\n    - Shred-worthy Nouns themed sculpture fabrications\n    - Installs of commemorative QR/NFC enabled plaques\n    - Unveiling and onboarding events fully documented\n    - Releases of all works onchain as paid or free mints\n    - All mint proceeds split with creators and treasury\n    - Being enabled by Nouns is core to Gnars' story\n- **Administration of GNARS strategy - 42 ETH**\n    - Coordinate community-driven promotional activities\n    - Manage various Gnars Media House curatorial efforts\n    - Oversee day to day operations and general administration\n    - Experiment with retro rewards (up to 2 ETH/month/contributor)\n    - Community discord moderation and shredder onboarding\n    - Collaborate with Rainbow wallet on QR / NFC activations\n    - Disburse free Gnars (10%) from multisig for shredders\n    - Provide assistance to our pods and working groups\n- **Migrate Gnars to Zora Network - 8 ETH**\n    - Add a timelock period/minimum quorum before new DAO opens up for props so nobody captures the first few props\n    - Deploy all contracts to Zora\n    - Edit frontend to integrate with Zora\n    - Migrate subgraph\n    - Implement gnars claiming process\n    - Plan for treasury migration\n    - Complete full migration\n\n📝 *Through onchain governance we will allocate funds as earmarked and will be experimenting with Partitions for a holistic approach to treasury management.

The Small Grants Committee (later known as NSFW) and Prop House rounds have fueled considerable community contributions, propelling the protocol's momentum. Yet, during the latter half of Nouns Season 2, obtaining small grants grew challenging. Additionally, the continuous management of Prop House Rounds demands consistent coordination.\n\nWe want to help patch this bug in the protocol, and bring back the Builder-forward Nounish Vibes that brought many of us here in the first place.\n\nWe are a trusted group of contributors in the ecosystem who are willing to collectively take on the challenge of running a dynamic and transparent Small Grants Allocation Pod, as well as coordinating and championing a series of exciting biweekly Prop House Rounds over the next six months of Nouns Season 3. \n\n[![s2-noggles.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/W4SHH2bj/s2-noggles.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/SX2dXbMt)\n\n---\n\n## **THE PLAN**\n\n1. Coordinate with the Prop House team to set up two new \"Season 3 Grants\" Infinite Rounds, where anyone in the ecosystem can apply for retroactive funding up to a maximum of 5 ETH or proactive funding up to a maximum of 1 ETH. Our team will review grant applications on a rolling week-by-week basis, with a goal to allocate ~14 ETH per month.  \n2. Coordinate and champion a series of Biweekly Temporal Nouns Prop House Rounds, alternating between Open Grants Rounds and Themed Grants Rounds such as “Visual Arts”, “Keep Nouns Weird”, “Gaming/Esports”, “CC0 Music”, “Public Goods,” “Media and Content,” etc. We plan to explore various token-voting methods across all the Prop House rounds we run over the next 6 months, engaging the wider nounish community in some cases.\n3. Maintain a [Public-facing Discord](https://discord.gg/qmN4sfsXmh) for community members to ask questions and receive feedback on their applications while also using Prop House’s built-in comment functionality to provide ongoing transparent, public feedback on builder ideas. \n4. Publish a public monthly summary of funds deployed for full transparency and accountability.\n\n---\n\n## **THE PEOPLE**\n\nFor an important program like this, it is essential to have a team that is 1) Known and Trusted, 2) Knowledgeable and Experienced About the Ecosystem and 3) Reliable at Execution.\n\nThe proposing team has all been active and trusted contributors to Nouns for 1+ years minimum, have an intimate knowledge of the Nouniverse, and have all delivered on past projects.\n\n*Core Team Will Include:*\n* [Al409](https://twitter.com/al409eth)\n* [BradQ](https://twitter.com/iambradq)\n* [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi)\n* [ChrisCoCreated](https://twitter.com/ChrisCoCreated)\n* [Joshua Fisher](https://twitter.com/JoshuaFisher)\n* [Maty](https://twitter.com/matyETH/)\n* [Prof Werder](https://twitter.com/ProfWerder)\n* [Sasquatch](https://twitter.com/PartSasquatch)\n* [SuperTightWoody](https://twitter.com/SuperTightWoody/)\n* [Tha Swami](https://twitter.com/tha_swami) and his daughter [Lil Purple Blueberry](https://twitter.com/lilpurpberry)\n* [Toady Hawk](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk)\n\nTeam will only be compensated based on individual participation via Coordinape rounds every month allocated by participating team members. Funds will be managed in a 3/5 Multisig. \n\n**All decisions on funding will be made by committee vote with a reasonable quorum and never at any one team member’s sole discretion. Members of the team will not be eligible for funding from either the Infinite Rounds or the S3G Prop House Rounds.**\n\n---\n\n## **THE PRICE**\n\n- Monthly Open & Themed Prop House Rounds: 100 ETH\n- Season 3 Grants Infinite Rounds: 85 ETH\n- Admin/Expenses: 45 ETH \n    - (Admin Expense Ratio: <20%)\n\n---\n\n## **THE PAYOFF**\n\nIt has been quite some time since we have seen the Nouns ecosystem buzzing with the energy of artists and creatives, the insights of talented developers and the vibes of passionate proliferators. \n\nWe will put our reputations on the line and bring our skills and dedication to bear to allocate these DAO funds as effectively and transparently as possible to the most passionate and deserving builders, coders and creatives in the Nouniverse. \n\nRecent Prop House

(w)stETH to rETH Treasury Diversification 🐮\n\n## Description\n\nFollowing the [recent proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320) to test CronFi’s TWAMM solution for [LST diversification](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10) of Nouns treasury, we at CoW Protocol would like to propose testing execution using our unique batch auction process before proceeding with the full 7k ETH amount. \n\nThere’s been interest in diversifying [Nouns DAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10), specifically stETH→rETH. Recently some twitter avatars have [posted](https://twitter.com/0x70626a/status/1684936056443969536) a good analysis of the 500 ETH TWAMM trade, specifically, that the trade resulted in 518.51 rETH received for 500 wstETH (a whopping 1.25% slippage for a stable swap!). We believe CoW Protocol will provide a much more competitive execution price, that is compatible with fair market prices.\n\n## Background\n\nCoW Protocol has been using a multi-token batch auction on Ethereum mainnet for over two years, facilitating [>$27.3B of trading volume](https://dune.com/cowprotocol/cowswap). CoW Protocol uniquely allows its users to get best execution prices even with a lax slippage tolerance thanks to 15 competitive solvers participating in an auction mechanism that protects the users by granting the right to execute the trade to the solver offering maximal price improvement.\n\nCoW Protocol is used by a [number of DAOs](https://cow.fi/daos) for their trading operations including ENS, Aave, Nexus Mutual, Gnosis, Karpatkey, Olympus DAO, Badger DAO, Yearn and more. \n\n## Advantages\n\nCoW Protocol pioneered intent-based trading since its inception in early 2021. This allows users to define order parameters without specifying the actual execution path (`calldata`). Users should expect the most optimised execution route to be chosen by the winning solver at the time of execution. \n\n## Considerations\n\nGiven a sell order of 500 wstETH→rETH there are several options for order placement that can provide different properties. We'll focus on a *TWAP* order setup although it seems to not be necessary in a smaller 500 ETH trade - the purpose is to demonstrate how a larger order could be set up.\n\nFor a 500 wstETH→rETH we propose to use a TWAP order of 5 equal parts worth 100 wstETH each. This may result in an execution up to 525 rETH.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJfUbBKo2.png)\n\n### `TWAP` Conditional order\n\n* Launch date: August 17th, 2023. [See twitter post.](https://twitter.com/CoWSwap/status/1692152855694803112?s=20)\n* Transactional volume: ~$4.2M. [See dune query](https://dune.com/cowprotocol/cow-swap-limit-orders-kpis).\n* Value held within `ExtensibleFallbackHandler`-upgraded Safes: ~$12.3M\n\nThe TWAP [implementation](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow) uses a constant limit price across each. Given the stability of wstETH→rETH, the limit price may be set in advance with a high confidence that this will be representative at the time the proposal is executed (and for the duration of the TWAP).\n\nOrder parameters suggested for this proposal:\n* Limit price: 1 wstETH = 1.038 rETH. This includes 1% slippage tolerance to allow for charging a fee from the sell token and to get higher confidence in execution. **It is still expected to be executed with a much lower slippage in practice.** See the above mentioned dune dashboard's *'order surplus'* whereby the order's slippage is protected.\n* 5 equal parts of 100 wstETH\n* Time intervals of two hours between parts \n\n## Methodology\n\nTo achieve this TWAP, the proposed transaction bundle will:\n\n1. Wrap the required `stETH` to `wstETH` so that it may be traded.\n2. Create a `Safe` owned by the DAO treasury that is used as a staging contract for the TWAP.\n3. Trigger the TWAP, with the resulting `rETH` from each swap being sent directly back to the DAO treasury.\n\n### Use of `Safe`\n\n* Developers: `Safe`\n* Audits: [See their Github Repository](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/tree/af488f0a649a3be2ea01e0f7a6af1587d0250c2d/docs).\n\nThe `Safe` is used as a staging area for the funds used in the TWAP. As CoW Protocol uses intent based trading, the `owner` of the order needs to sign their intent (done using a private key for an `EOA`, done using [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) for a smart contract). \n\nWith this requirement in mind, the DAO treasury contract for Nouns doesn't support EIP-1271. This is why a `Safe` is used in combination with `ComposableCoW` (detailed below).\n\nThe `Safe` that is created in the proposal bundle **ensures that the only owner is set to the DAO Treasury**. At all times, the funds remain under the direct control of the DAO treasury with the same timelock conditions.\n\n#### Execution Risk\n\nIn the transaction bundle funds are sent atomically to a newly created `Safe`. This means that the `Safe`'s address needs to be calculated beforehand. This is done using `CREATE2` logic, therefore the `Safe` is created at a deterministic address. The flow:\n\n1. DAO Treasury sets an approval on `wstETH` for the to-be-created `Safe`.\n2. The `Safe` is created and initialised.\n3. The funds are **PULLED** from the DAO Treasury to the `Safe`.\n\nCritically, with the above methodology there is *no ability for funds to be sent to an address where they are not retrievable*.\n\n**CAUTION:** This candidate proposal assumes successful passage of [Proposal #359](https://nouns.wtf/vote/359) **AND** no intermediate proposal that interacts with the new treasury's balance of `wstETH`.\n\n### Use of `ComposableCoW` / `TWAP`\n\n* Developer: mfw78 (funded by CowDAO Grants Program, and now a [Core Contributor to CoW Protocol](https://snapshot.org/#/cowgrants.eth/proposal/0x0202a88c6792d1bd1e534cf1da94769130f495e72247e666b4afff8b22da9db0)).\n* Audits (jointly funded by `Safe` and CoW Protocol): [Ackee](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow/blob/main/audits/ackee-blockchain-cow-protocol-composablecow-extensiblefallbackhandler-report-1.2.pdf), [Gnosis Internal](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow/blob/main/audits/gnosis-ComposableCoWMayJul2023.pdf).\n* Other: Repository recently on-boarded to [CoW Protocol GitHub organisation](https://github.com/cowprotocol/).\n\n`ComposableCoW` is a conditional smart order framework that was [incubated by the CoW Grants Program](https://snapshot.org/#/cowgrants.eth/proposal/0xb7815ca1f5aea2ec537295fd452332680eb1be379f3356950dc8ba151d83f9c5). `TWAP` is an order type implemented in the `ComposableCoW` framework. The contracts are thoroughly tested and audited. To date, volume processed exceeds ~$4.2M.\n\nUsing `ComposableCoW`, a smart contract (such as the `Safe` deployed in the proposal) is able to autonomously indicate its intent to trade. This intent is monitored by a *Watch Tower* (currently a Tenderly Web3 Action, deployed by the CoW Protocol team), with the intent relayed to the CoW Protocol API. In this framework - for TWAP, unlike `Milkman` - the smart contract specifies the *entire order structure to be submitted to the API*. There are no trust assumptions placed in the Watch Tower (besides the Watch Tower not running, leading to a griefing attack, but CoW Protocol for reputational reasons are incentivised to keep the Watch Tower operational).\n\n#### Differences compared to `Milkman`\n\nBoth were funded by the CoW Protocol Grants Program. `Milkman` seeks to solve the issue of an autonomous swap from ABC→XYZ tokens, whereas `ComposableCoW` provides an entire framework for producing *conditional* orders. TWAP is an example of a conditional order built with this framework - allowing a large trade to settle in multiple parts over time, minimising price impact.\n\n## Proposal Operations\n\nThe operations in the proposal are:\n\n1. Approve the required amount of `stETH` for wrapping into `wstETH`.\n2. Wrap `stETH` into `wstETH`.\n3. Approve the to-be-created Safe to use the Executor's `wstETH`.\n4. Create the trading `Safe` (owner: Exector, owners: 1).\n5. Configure the `Safe`:\n    i. Set `ComposableCoW` as the domain verifier for `GPv2Settlement` (CoW Protocol signing).\n    ii.

We believe the app will enhance voter participation and democratize decision-making. The app will also serve as a valuable onboarding tool for new members and complement our existing governance clients. \n\n## Description\nWe have been developing an iOS app for NounsDAO. Our primary objective is to boost voter participation by providing Nouners with a user-friendly app that simplifies interactions with the Nouns protocol. We firmly believe that casting votes should be as effortless as sending a text message.\nThe core features will empower Nouners and community members to access the latest information and interact seamlessly with the Nouns protocol. Additionally, our experimental features will open doors to new onboarding methods, enhance community engagement and discover new utility. This app will be a valuable addition to existing governance clients, such as Nounsagora, Voter, Mmmogu, Nounoclock, Shenounigans, and many others.\n\n## Core Features List\n* Feed tab: Featuring the latest community, auction, trade, and proposal information in a clean and concise format.\n* Community tab: Providing an easy and concise way to find Nouners and delegates.\n* Auctions tab: Displaying the latest auction and market information from platforms like Opensea, LooksRare, Blur, etc.\n* Proposals tab: Read, track, and share proposals.\n* Wallet tab: Connect your wallet, check your Noun bags, cast and delegate votes (with Metamask, Rainbow, etc., integration).\n* Push notifications: A flexible notifications center for all activities, including notifications for specific trait minting, trades, delegations, etc.\n\n## Experimental Features\n* AirPlay support: Stream \"A Nouns Movie: Rise of Blus\" from the app to a monitor or TV.\n* Maps support: Display cities where Nouners and community members travel and reside (limited to locality).\n* NFTs: Distribute commemorative NFTs to active participants (those who check auctions more than three times a week receive a code to mint a unique Nounish NFT).\n\n## Timeline\n* Core features delivered in 1-2 months\n* Experimental Features in 4 months\n\n## Git repo\n* We welcome PRs at\nhttps://github.com/fiveoceans-dev/nouns-mobile/tree/main/ios-swift\n\n## Budget\n10 eth -

There’s a palpable tension and curiosity in that single frame that makes us **care**. \n\nI want to bring that to a fun art project focused on a pair of Nouns - Chip and Benny - and their adventures in the - slightly (or sometimes *very*) heightened and over-the-top - world of ‘**Noun en Scène**’.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreidmghr5rzmqwejtz5gwvnlmyrmnbzf7noty6mb5b7ykcgyqln5veu)\n\nThink of it as a cinematic one-shot storytelling project that takes our pixelated, digital little Nouns, turns them into real life ‘muppet’-like puppets and then throws them into film scenes with flesh and blood people.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreieoo7k4u7uen4d7slr6kt7re2234xtivk7sybo3j4z72buzpgueju)\n(*cinematic scenes that make you ask questions and keep looking*)\n\nEvery one-shot tosses our sweet, little Nouns into a new dramatic scene where they're forced to deal with the crazy situation they've gotten themselves into by trying to help or do a good deed for a random human they've met. \n\nAnd through these scenic moments, the world of Chip, Benny and the 'Noun en Scène' project will grow, evolve and hopefully become something people want to see more of!\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreia25gd5kfdglu52e2jakou3luj4neyzse52jgeelpvti57o2jojwi)\n\nBy utilizing ‘muppet’-like characters mixed with real people and heightened, cinematically-lit scenes, the absurdity and beauty of life will become that much more stark, profound and hopefully very funny. \n\nTaking cues and paying homage to a variety of influences including Alex Prager, The Far Side, world cinema, the Kermitage Collection and many more, this project aims to utilize a couple Nouns to create captivating characters we just can’t get enough of. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifed3xlopidln4j4mieislub2pq4txtoealf6cvswxew6f7dlsxky)\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreif6ubfkoutleoqfxdhqctt2cdqwuidral6csbcp2k74brj32ahdai)\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreieoelw5lordgtyffzqby2pwjfs6u6crdhagk4t24mjgqlxma2wqrq)\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreibkhnf5lwzniwisn7jgzyxmk6ujnenj7gozeib4j7whkgndu3thaa)\n\nChip and Benny are just a couple innocent, little guys trying to help and do good in the world, but instead they keep finding themselves entangled in situations way beyond their depth. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreihyboig23zcntxs4mhhqkwyeqfzb3nnj7kq7bsfbbf5nwdbbwxlvy)\n\n# **COOL. SO WHAT’S THE PLAN?**\n---\n\nThese shoots will be treated like an indie film production - the difference being that we are capturing **single shots** that tell full, rich stories while still requiring casting, makeup, lighting, location scouting/rentals, puppet styling etc. \n\nOn the casting front, while at first it will make sense to work with local working actors/models and friends, as the project gains traction and grows - or when I’m working on my next tv show - I think there is a fun way to bring known name actors into these scenes and add a whole other level of playfulness to the project. \n\nThe first step will be designing, modeling and manufacturing our Noun ‘muppets.’ **Luckily, I’ve gotten a very exciting collaborator on board for this!**\n\n# **PUPPET HEAP!**\n---\n[![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreifgehg3mxpwez6iwiptsiqciuhg4v447nskvqyts6aclxsyxwpqzq)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/agxY_pJwo8o?si=vKyoY-cGw9rH14NI)\n\n\n**Puppet Heap** is a unique design and production studio specializing in storytelling through the creation of iconic characters for all sorts of media including film, television, advertising, theater, and new media. The company was founded by artist, designer, filmmaker, and teacher Paul Andrejco after observing the burgeoning pile of puppets that had accumulated in his Hoboken apartment back in the early ‘90s. Now, just a few blocks away, Puppet Heap is home to teams of artists, designers, writers, and producers creating character based narratives for clients around the world including **The Walt Disney Company, Sesame Workshop, and Nickelodeon**. Puppet Heap has been entrusted with the care, maintenance, and creative support of the Muppets for Disney’s **The Muppets Studio** since 2006.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeicf2f5r3nabecoodiso5baxyzi2gwafqaobj74ju22osfbvl7xxle)\n(*Puppet Heap team on set of Imagine Dragon's 'Radioactive'*)\n\nPuppet Heap loves the project - *I nounspilled them* - and will be joining to design and create the physical puppets of Chip and Benny. And as scale and scope continue to evolve in their journey (we have big plans), they’ll be there, helping to tell their growing story - and all the other Nouns that come into play too.\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreigg33zfrairgp6s7pp4ubxeqbub2aflalz744n6ux3czxoiwdhhfu)\n\n# **AWESOME! AND WHAT ABOUT ME?**\n---\n\nMy name is Chris Martin - not of Coldplay, sorry - and I’ve been making independent, global film and television productions for a decade plus now - primarily in Korea.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreianc72wofibm66pb6cdpyhrxwkyvydmryhcdiqsc4w3zzycf6nqzi)\n\nMost recently, I co-created, co-wrote, directed, showran,and EP’ed 20 episodes of a show called 'Dramaworld' currently streaming on Amazon that stars well-known actors including Liv Hewson (‘Yellowjackets’, ‘Santa Clarita Diet’), Brett Gray (‘I’m a Virgo’, ‘On My Block’), Daniel Dae Kim (‘Lost’, ‘Hawaii 5-0’), Ha Jiwon (‘Secret Garden’) and K-pop star Henry Lau.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreidcjuv6vkzugofvzyvr757lelpmvombyncr3pey7z7kndmjx2cd64)\n\nWith everything I create, I try to lean into **a playful, magical realist tone that’s grounded in heart**, which is the kind of storytelling that I think is not only a perfect fit for Nouns, but also an incredible way to bring people into this journey of Chip and Benny as they go around trying to help.\n\n\n\nI love everything about Nouns - the ethos, the support for creative, weird projects, and did I mention the freakin’ Noggles?! - and have been trying to figure out how I could do something creative that furthered that mission for quite awhile now. \n\nThen suddenly, while wandering around a street festival the other day, I saw this:\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreibrizjphslww7h46ya3f74alx2xunpxznggmmnd4f2mhmnp6sxmna)\n\n**And bingo! 💡**\n\nThe idea for ‘Noun en Scène’ landed fully formed in my brain! And I knew I had to make it a reality and see what it could eventually become!\n\n# **WHY SHOULD NOUNS FUND THIS?**\n---\n\nStorytelling is everything - always has been. And in a world where we are inundated with ‘content’ online, a playful, quirky and precise project like this will be a breath of fresh air to stand out against the noise.\n\nUtilizing photography as a medium and consistent characters as the subject will allow fans to come back, excited to see where the journey of Chip and Benny will lead and who they'll be trying to 'help' next. \n\nAnd by staging everything down to the last detail, each photographic story that comes out of ‘Noun en Scène’ will simultaneously be a fine art piece, a Sunday (web)comic and continuous character development leading to a broader (and very Noun-curious) audience. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreid2an66kifpojvxdzq4pjmnw5ix2cynbqhwemincxiclap2a65i3y)\n\nAnd in the spirit of '**mint everything**,' we are planning to utilize Zora to **mint and document our progress** - design sketches, scripts, behind the scenes, etc. It feels like a great way to document the process of creation and build something creative in public. \n\n# **Speaking of creative, meet Benny!**\nHere's Paul's initial design for Benny:\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeiad34c4vymsclagkv3jrfzag6hzuzpys5ttuqrpejtekgjjh7j27u)\n\nArms and legs, oh my! With our puppets, we want to keep what makes Nouns distinct while adding a whole new flavor that brings them to life and gives them character. \n\n### **The (mis)adventures of Chip and Benny** \nBy creating empathy and connection with our two little Nouns through **visual storytelling**, the project will help spread Nouns and nounish-ness far and wide - just how Chip and Benny would want it. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreib5bcbujje7cllcnu4f7iiwympjh3hdlk6tnctarnv7tmpl52gv4y)\n(*One-shot example sketch - 'Chip and Benny Check for- AHHHHH!'*)\n\nAnd we plan to have this first leg of the project culminate in a **fun droposal** that takes Chip and Benny IRL in eye-catching ways (*see below for a tease*). \n\n# **THE ASK AKA THE BUDGET**\n---\n\nWe want to propose a tight, but realistic budget that still allows us to execute this at the highest professional standards, so that we can first not only prove the concept, but create something that rivals the quality of anything you'd see in a high budget studio release. \n\nWe want to go above and beyond everyone’s expectations for what 'Noun en Scène' can be because seeing is believing and we think this initial batch of scenes will prove the potential of building out characters in a uniquely nounish way and make people want to see where we can go with Chip and Benny in the future. \n\n**BUDGET:**\n* **$40,000 USDC (2 puppets x $20,000 USDC/puppet)** **one-time cost** for the design and fabrication of our ‘Noun Muppets’ - this allows Puppet Heap to design, costume and build out Chip and Benny in their physical ‘muppet’-ish forms (**to be used again and again as the project continues and evolves**).\n* **$50,000 USDC** production budget to shoot and finish 5 'one-shots' - this will be a fully crewed up shoot with actors, set design, hair & makeup etc. and the budget will be used to pay crew, rent equipment, secure locations, finish photos in post etc. (all the production related expenses)\n* **Detailed breakdown** to give a general idea of how the funds will be used **[HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yym2vm-ojk9sXjrwziRHCDY6VYrSZPva3XBaryZLFUY/edit?usp=sharing)**\n* **1 NOUN post delivery** (*cookie head Noun 483*) - A big reason I want to do this is to become a more active and involved part of the Nouns community so I can more fully participate and build together with other Nouners\n\n**TOTAL BUDGET: $90,000 USDC + 1 NOUN (post delivery)**\n\n# **TIMELINE**\n---\n\nUpon prop passing, we can make our puppets and be in production in approximately **2.5 months** and aiming to have finished images ready **~1 month later**.\n\nAll the while **minting our progress and creative developments** on Zora.\n\n# **FUTURE STEPS**\n---\n\nMy aim for is to use the project to develop the characters and story of these two best friends on their journey to help and do good - even if it always seems to go a little sideways - in a surprising novel and onchain way. 'Noun en Scène' as the first piece will allow us to capture surprising, fun and shareable bitesize stories, which hopefully utimately brings Nouns into the real(ish) world and helps people fall in love with Chip and Benny.\n\nWhich brings me back to the aforementioned droposal! \n\nWhat better way to drum up curiousity than a **droposal** to help take Chip and Benny IRL. More on 👇 soon! \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeihvxlu2d46qgru3qmlldtxluswjmujefg3k7vby6sdgb4cifyzmuy)\n(⌐◨-◨'s *on billboards?*)\n\n\nPaul and I have a ton of fun ideas for where to take this and how to grow it, so we're looking forward to what we can achieve this go round while keeping our minds open to how it can be expanded (*cough* a full blown live-action series *cough*).\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and look forward to making the world a little more Noun-ish!\n\n**Time for Chip and Benny to save the world.

He’s a fatalistic struggling music artist just trying to make it. Everyday Ed B faces a new challenge – having to fight off racists at Trader Joes while perusing the vegan aisle, or running butt ass naked for a couple of dollars to pay his rent, OR having to sell photos of himself on the internet to help fund his next record – BUT they never stop him from pushing towards his dream of becoming the Beyoncé of puppets.\n\n## FORMAT\n\n* 10-12 minute web(3)isode\n* Stop motion and mixed media animation.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/aah6X7X.jpg)\n# Pilot Episode\n\n## SYNOPSIS\n\n“A Song About Black Love” - Infatuated by a blossoming love interest, Ed B works out a new song about the joys of Black love. Billy, Ed’s bandmate, roommate and white ally, questions a hidden secret within Ed’s relationship and mayhem ensues.\n\n## FUNDING\n\n“A Song About Black Love” was self funded by Ed Balloon in 2022 primarily through the sale of NFTs. The tentpole fundraising project was the Run Ed Collection, a first-of-its-kind generative sound and motion NFT project that blended stop-motion, 2D and 3D animation, and music. Ed Balloon dropped the 1000 piece collection and it sold out, kickstarting production of the pilot. To help uplift other artists, Ed Balloon pledged 50 percent of the collection’s secondary sales toward The Ed Balloon Generational Wealth Fund, which collects work from Black and other under-represented artists in Web3.\n\n## CAST\n\n**Ed B “The Puppet”** | Ed Balloon\n**Billy** | Seth Green (Robot Chicken, Family Guy)\n**Peggy** | Blair Socci (Comedian)\n**Savannah** | Destiny Lavigne\n___\n# Nouns Integration in New Episodes\n\nThe possibilities for Nouns integration within the Ed B The Puppet universe are infinite. Noggles can be introduced as unique accessories that Ed and Billy can interact with, enabling them to solve problems or embark on new adventures. Noun characters could even make an appearance, bringing a sense of curiosity, wonder, or even magical qualities to the narrative.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/Rw9HCbF.jpg)\n# Project Objective\n\n## Amplify Diversity\n\nBy creating content that celebrates and embraces diversity, we can showcase a wide array of perspectives and experiences. The Ed B ‘The Puppet’ Show will feature characters from different backgrounds, challenging stereotypes and fostering empathy among audiences. Through collaboration with the Nouns, we aim to elevate the visibility of diverse voices and promote a more inclusive entertainment landscape.\n\n## Utilize Satire for Social Commentary\n\nSatire serves as a powerful tool for social commentary, allowing us to address pertinent societal issues in a thought-provoking and engaging manner. By employing satire, we can challenge the status quo, stimulate critical thinking, and spark conversations that lead to positive change. Our collaboration with the Nouns will provide a platform for satirical content that encourages viewers to question and reconsider established norms.\n\n## Promote Collaboration and Solidarity\n\nOur project embraces the spirit of collaboration within the web3 community. By partnering with the Nouns, we aim to showcase the power of collaboration in amplifying diverse voices and driving innovation. Through cross-platform promotions, joint marketing initiatives, and immersive fan experiences, we can create a unified front that promotes solidarity within the industry. We will be using noun features (Noggles, characters, etc) in these episodes.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/LGpjxXz.jpg)\n# Creative Team\n\n## Ed Balloon [Series Creator & Creative Director]\n\nSpearheading cultural representation and identity through his music and digital art, Ed Balloon has solidified himself not only as a Web3 artist and musician but also as a community leader.  Known for his innovative approach to music making, dynamic production style, and unique blend of electronic, hip-hop, and R&B, his 2022 Run Ed collection was presented as a one-of-a-kind generative sound and motion endeavor that blended stop-motion, 2D and 3D animation, and music. To help uplift other artists, 50 percent of the collection’s secondary sales continued to go toward The Ed Balloon Generational Wealth Fund, which collects work from Black and other under-represented artists in Web3. The pioneering musician also recently self-funded through the sale of NFTs the stop motion animated satire \"A SONG ABOUT BLACK LOVE.”  Executive produced by Daveed Diggs and starring Ed alongside actor Seth Green, the film showcases the difficulties of finding love as a black puppet.  Ed was also recently nominated to nftnow's NFT100, a celebration of the top 100 influential creators and community leaders in the NFT space.\n\nTwitter: @Ed_Balloon\n\n## Daveed Diggs [Executive Producer]\n* Vocalist in experimental hip hop group Clipping.\n* Co-star in The Little Mermaid, Hamilton, Snowpiercer, Wonder, Velvet Buzzsaw\n* Writer and Producer of Blindspotting\n* Tony and Grammy Winner.

In the spirit of positive sum collaboration, we did not want to propose a total amount of PH funding that would be difficult to allocate to builders without diminishing returns. We also received some feedback recommending a reduced time scope to prove out MVP, and have taken this to heart as well. Ultimately, we do think there is room and need for some passionate parallel efforts when it comes to finding and funding good ideas in Season 3 of Nouns.*\n\n## **THE PROBLEM**\n\nNouns historically has used small grants and Prop House rounds to complement onchain proposals. The Small Grants Committee (later known as NSFW) and Prop House rounds had fueled considerable community contributions, propelling the protocol's momentum. But during the latter half of Nouns Season 2, obtaining small grants grew challenging. \n\nWe want to help patch this bug in the protocol, and bring back the Builder-forward Nounish Vibes that brought many of us here in the first place.\n\nWe are a trusted group of contributors in the ecosystem who are willing to collectively take on the challenge of running a dynamic and transparent Small Grants Allocation Pod, as well as coordinating and championing a series of exciting biweekly Prop House Rounds over the next 3 months of Nouns Season 3. \n\n[![s2-noggles.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/W4SHH2bj/s2-noggles.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/SX2dXbMt)\n\n## **THE PLAN**\n\n1. Coordinate with the Prop House team to set up two new \"Season 3 Grants\" Infinite Rounds, where anyone in the ecosystem can apply for retroactive funding up to a maximum of 5 ETH or proactive funding up to a maximum of 1 ETH. (Infinite Rounds are a newer piece of Prop House infra that allows orgs to deploy small grants funding in an organized and transparent way. See [Rug Radio Small Grants example here](https://prop.house/rug-radio-small-grants).) Our team will review grant applications on a rolling week-by-week basis, with a goal to allocate ~17 ETH per month, depending on submission quality.  \n\n2. Coordinate and trial a series of 3 monthly Themed Prop House Rounds with specific focuses such as “Visual Arts”, “Keep Nouns Weird”, “Gaming/Esports”, “CC0 Music”, “Public Goods,” “Media and Content\" (Final themes to be Voted on by the DAO.) We plan to explore various token-voting methods, engaging the wider nounish community in some cases with a strong consideration for maintaining as much sybil protection as possible.\n\n3. Maintain a [Public-facing Discord](https://discord.gg/zY7jpzKwEN) and consistent messaging in the Farcaster Nouns channel, for community members to ask questions and receive feedback on their applications, while also using Prop House’s built-in comment functionality to provide ongoing transparent, public feedback on builder ideas as well.  \n\n4. Publish a public summary of funds deployed for full transparency and accountability.\n\n## **THE PEOPLE**\n\nFor an important program like this, it is essential to have a team that is 1) Known and Trusted, 2) Knowledgeable and Experienced About the Ecosystem and 3) Reliable at Execution.\n\nThe proposing team has all been active and trusted contributors to Nouns for 1+ years minimum, have an intimate knowledge of the Nouniverse, and have all delivered on past projects.\n\n*Core Team Will Include:*\n* [Al409](https://twitter.com/al409eth)\n* [BradQ](https://twitter.com/iambradq)\n* [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi)\n* [ChrisCoCreated](https://twitter.com/ChrisCoCreated)\n* [Joshua Fisher](https://twitter.com/JoshuaFisher)\n* [Maty](https://twitter.com/matyETH/)\n* [Prof Werder](https://twitter.com/ProfWerder)\n* [Sasquatch](https://twitter.com/PartSasquatch)\n* [SuperTightWoody](https://twitter.com/SuperTightWoody/)\n* [Tha Swami](https://twitter.com/tha_swami) and his daughter [Lil Purple Blueberry](https://twitter.com/lilpurpberry)\n* [Toady Hawk](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk)\n\nTeam will only be compensated based on individual participation via Coordinape rounds every month allocated by participating team members and will rotate through responsibilities. Funds will be managed in a 3/6 Multisig. \n\n**All decisions on funding will be made by committee vote with a reasonable quorum and never at any one team member’s sole discretion.

A proposal that generates more proposals.\n\n\nHave a look at the first iteration of [noundry-gallery.wtf](https://noundry-gallery.wtf/)\n![](https://imgur.com/kIF3iq6.gif)\n\n## **IDEA**\n\n### **BEYOND DISCORD**\n\nThe Noundry channel on Discord is one of the coolest places in the nouniverse, where dozens of artists share Nouns designs and riff off each other. However, it is somewhat niche, and not enough people are aware of it.\n\nTo address that, we want to create a public-facing gallery that will help us attract more artists and community's traits.\n\n### **PROP #348**\n\nThis idea took shape while considering the anniversary [prop #348](https://nouns.wtf/vote/348), when Goldy and team self-organised and stepped forward with some really nice traits. Thanks to them, Nouns had the opportunity to showcase its unique ability to redefine itself through user-generated content.\n\nHowever, the fact that they were the only ones to submit a proposal, despite the vibrant activity in the Noundry channel, highlights the need to make it easier for anyone to submit traits at anytime.\n\nWe took inspiration from [#348](https://nouns.wtf/vote/348) votes with reason and started building to solve this.\n\n**Noun40**:\n*\"1-Invite heads and accessories to be submitted whenever to a public place (have it be known that if your art gets included on the anniversary art update then you'll likely win X eth in retro funding enforced by tradition) \n2-Invite competition for curation through a mandated PH round 1-2 months ahead of anniversary. The mandated round selects the winning curation and includes a meaningful eth prize to incentivize and compensate for the work involved. \n3-The winning curation team submits the art update prop to coincide with the anniversary (given the legitimacy through the mandated PH round, it will likely pass)\"*\n\n**4156**:\n*\"(imho) the last step of removing the training wheels from the noundry should be the death of the convention that artwork only gets updated once per year and 8 traits at a time. It's a competitive advantage of nouns that the artwork is upgradable and the metaphor is open enough to support infinite heads, and we should be maximizing this advantage by engaging with artists, famous or anon, in every country, to make the heads collection as vast and high quality as we can. think of this as the Nouns version of the chain with the most proof of work. This could be especially important post v3. if many instances of Nounsdao have permissionless pools of capital, artists and collectors will be attracted to the instance that accumulates the most cultural capital, and new heads and other traits are an important part of this process\"*\n\n***\n\n## **NOUNDRY GALLERY**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/N21sSlv.jpg)\n*Light mode*\n\n[Noundry-gallery.wtf](https://noundry-gallery.wtf/) lets anyone with a wallet upload their 32x32 transparent pngs for head and accessory traits.Submit your traits, style them using existing NounsDAO assets, and share them with the community.\n\nNo strings attached: you retain all rights to your art until you choose to submit it to the DAO through a candidate proposal. If the proposal is approved, and your artwork is added to the collection, it will become CC0.\n\n*Note: We were reluctant on having glasses due to a potential high impact on the collection, but we might bring them back to satisfy other subDAOs.*\n\n ### **FIRST VERSION**\n\nSo far we've implemented: \n\n* Wallet connect\n* Style your traits with nounsDAO assets and publish them to the homepage and your profile page\n* Favorite traits\n* Sort traits by name, creation date, artists and likes\n* Sort through community members by names, total likes received, sign-up date and total traits submitted\n* Evaluate traits by combining them with nounsDAO assets by hitting the “generate” button on the trait page\n* Edit your profile page and connect your Twitter account\n* Dark/Light mode\n\n![](https://imgur.com/CVAa70L.jpg)\n*\"Generate\" on the trait page to test different combos*\n\n![](https://imgur.com/UxdIrLW.jpg)\n*Community page with sorting mechanisms*\n\n### **NEXT FEATURES**\n\n*  Submit candidate proposal form: in a few clicks, select eligible traits from the site, generate images, encode traits using [Run-length encoding (RLE)](https://nouns.notion.site/Nouns-Protocol-32e4f0bf74fe433e927e2ea35e52a507#6bbc1162af90427bad2dda63a3b31254) and wallet sign a release form to make the trait CC0 if/when integrated with NounsDAO. This will output the transaction copy-pasta and the markdown, giving you all the necessary elements to create a proposal easily (see mockup below). OR/AND\n*  Autosubmit to the candidate proposal endpoint on Nouns.wtf using Nouns SDK and skip the markdown copy-pasta if that is a desirable option\n* Create a commission page where anyone can set up competition for a given trait ( 0.5 ETH for the best “Golf” or “Boat-anchor” trait for ex)\n* Twitter, Farcaster and Discord bots letting us know when new traits are uploaded\n* Integration with [Volky’s Noundry Studio ](https://studio.noundry.wtf/)(Create an “Upload to Gallery” button to directly open the \"Upload Trait\" modal on [noundry-gallery.wtf](https://noundry-gallery.wtf/).)\n* Ability to comment under each traits\n* Enable ENS avatars and usernames\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/11fHNmc.jpg)\n*\"Submit to DAO\" current mockup: Select trait, write a small description, generate sequential glasses and body color matrice to test combos, define compensation, attach release form, generate transaction with RLE encoding, and save markdown*\n\nWe want to leave room to learn from the community and see what features are desirable.\n\n**Budget: 21 ETH**\n***\n\n## **CURATION**\n\n### **NOUNDRY COMMITTEE**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/SQsJ0Zt.jpg)\n*10 Prop House elected curators NFT mockup*\n\nWhile [Noundry gallery](https://noundry-gallery.wtf/) can also be used for any subDAOs, when it comes to NounsDAO, we believe we should set up a process that guarantees quality and brand alignement. These pixels -along with the smart contract- support the treasury, and we should be considerate about what we choose to integrate with the current collection.\n\nWe suggest implementing a multi-step open process with a Prop House elected committee, akin to what large art institutions would employ, albeit executed on-chain.\n\nWe plan to conduct a Prop House round to elect 10 curators who will have the responsibility of selecting traits over the next 6 months. Each curator will receive a curator NFT and will be able to use their NFT to like traits on the platform.\n\nIf a trait receives likes from 8 curators or more, a 0.1ETH prize will be unlocked, and the trait can then be selected and proposed on-chain using the Submit to DAO page. While curators can post their own traits, they are not allowed to like their own submissions.\n\n**Budget: 10 ETH**\n\n### **ARTISTS REWARDS**\n\nArtists will get 0.1 ETH prizes when they receive more than 8 likes from curators. This budget is intended to attract artists and reach a critical mass, making the platform more appealing. With a 10 ETH budget, we can create 100 prizes. \n\nIf the experiment is successful after 6 months, we can consider repeating the process.\n\n**Budget: 10 ETH**\n\n### **MORE**\n\nIf other DAOs or Nounish projects are interested in using this platform, we could explore implementing workflows to facilitate their participation. Consider, for example, the recent 'Gardeners' concept from Nouns 40; it could be readily sourced from the community.\n\n## **CONCLUSION**\n\n[Noundry-gallery.wtf](https://noundry-gallery.wtf/) wants to help curate the great work and energy coming from the Noundry channel. I hope that in the future we can see many cool Nounish traits emerge from anons, community members, or even renowned artists. \n\nThank you for reading this prop. If approved, we will implement this next set of features in 3 months time and start the curation program in January 2024.\n\n**Total Budget: 41 ETH**\n\nAny questions or comments, feel free to reach out on twitter: [@Coralorca](https://twitter.com/coralorca)\n\n ⌐◨-◨\n\n***\n\n**About me**\nOne of the first nounish builder - started in June 2021 and never looked back.

There is no physical delivery on this support.\n\n## **Concept**\n\nA defining underground force in menswear in the 2010s, Palace here echoes the new and weirdness of Nouns through a series of pieces that will hybridize their creative universes – inherently Italian, boldly new, translated anew. The initial inspiration will be built on the Palace catalog itself and on the undeniable influence of Nouns on nft culture.\n\n## **Introduction**\n\n[Palace Skateboards](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) needs little introduction, but for the uninitiated, the London-based skateboarding and clothing brand has become a mainstay in the streetwear scene for incorporating 1990s and pop culture influences with their VHS-style clothing ads. In other words, it’s kitsch, cool, and everything in between.\n\n# **Why Palace?**\n\n[Palace](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) began as a brand for skateboarders. It is now a brand for all. Models turn up for castings in Palace. Working class Glasgow dads sport Palace. Jay-Z wears Palace. So does Rihanna. Teenage girls sleep in Palace, dreaming of the heart-throbs they’ve seen wearing Palace online. 2018’s Wimbledon finalists played on court in Palace. Soundcloud rappers adore Palace. The ICA exhibits Palace. Serious DJs with peerless techno collections adorn their record boxes with Palace stickers. Ravers ingest ecstasy pills produced in the shape of Palace’s Tri-Ferg logo. Socio-political causes, including the plights of both Jeremy Corbyn and the people of Palestine, have been smartly memed in versions of the Palace triangle.\n\nA middle-aged architect can slyly intimate he has better kids than his colleagues by picking something up at Palace, even if it’s just their socks. Virgil Abloh and Marc Jacobs wear Palace. London tube station walls are adorned by carriage-length adverts for Palace. The bigwigs at Ralph Lauren were so taken by the irrepressible rise of Palace that Palace became its first ever collaborator in 50 years of singularly myth-making fashion history.\n![](https://imgur.com/dlwqvv6.gif)\n![](https://imgur.com/OEHdbcQ.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/KsVOGlC.gif)\nFashion’s favourite photographers Alasdair McLellan, Juergen Teller and David Sims shoot for Palace. Silicon Valley is full of people in Palace. Blue-chip stylists buy Palace from their own pocket money to lend their imagery some of the company’s off-rail styles and indigenous London magic. i-D and British Vogue carry Palace ads. Madonna and child (Rocco) have been photographed proudly wearing Palace. All the while, a fat lad on a Midlands housing estate is looking great and feeling even greater in Palace while waiting for his Chinese takeaway and playing Fortnite.\n\n## Strength in Numbers\n\nThe large take on several already-created collaborations and communication from other brands to the nft audience is an excellent entry point for the brand to reach fans and a new market. Likewise, for the Nouns community;  **significant increases in brand awareness, favorability for further collaborations, and open public interest in the brand, consequently becomes a win-win.** To highlight the ROI of the collaboration, let's look at promoting the Palace brand among your collaborations;\n\n[Gucci](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjsKDzipOtF), [Mercedes](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CbXyjVPq0VI), [New Balance](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cr-s3WotGz1), [Adidas](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoHewHju2Ii), [RIMOWA](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoUlcMeqvAs), and many others.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/qCpbrcS.jpg)\n[PALACE JAPAN MAGAZINE](https://www.palaceskateboards.com/range/spring-2019/palace-japan-magazine/)\n\n**Approach**: Use public communication-powered resources to compare social media posts containing mentions of the Palace and Nouns brand, before and after the partnership.\n\"Outcome: Insight into the Marketing ROI of an NFT Dive from Palace\" **“ Significantly increases the reach of Nouns by talking to two sets of customers instead of one and gives a signal from one brand that the other brand is trusted by the upscale market.”**\n\n# **Phase One and Phase Two.**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/liP7MrS.jpg)\n\nDetailed legal processes and collaboration building over the next four months; **Phase one**\n\n• Recitals\n• Purpose\n• Confidentiality Clause\n• Commercial Clause\n• Investment Clause\n• Duties and Obligations of Collaborators\n• Reporting and Project Management\n• Intellectual Property Rights\n\n• Fashion product mix;\n• Creation and style;\n• Prototyping;\n• Product development;\n• Marketing and Sales Strategy;\n• Collection management;\n• Evaluation of results.\n\nFor the scope of this proposal, Synthetic team is acting as the liason on behalf of the Nouns community and will adhere to all non-confidentiality & legal agreements relevant to Palace's collaboration workflow. Synthetic will work closely with the Nouns community to share public work-in-progress updates regularly which do not breach the above said agreements.\n\nSynthetic is a mediator, and nouns have a proactive CC0 license, In short Palace would not need Synthetic for commercial construction, what we are doing is raising ideas and presenting about the Nouns ecosystem: the various subgroups, the vibe, and the importance.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/ObE6wW9.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/sC8GwqP.jpg)\n\n## Breakdown of legal conditions\n\n**Strategy**: Legal terms and already transcribed collaboration construction.\n\n(the terms below will be robustly written to avoid legal inconvenience)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/fPYHHdj.jpg)\n\n• Recreate the look and feel of the Palace collaborative product; designing new products for that collaboration; concentrated on multiple tacit marketing and management ideas that they share.\n\n• Synthetic and the built committee will be responsible for co-managing the community outreach and communication campaign during construction.\n\n• Creative control, both teams have to work within the decided parameters and cannot go beyond that and after each step, they must report to the other brand.\n\n• Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace team's design and construction team. (This is due to several cordial agreements that the brand already has with the media – Vogue, WWD, Hypebeast and others.)\n\n• Nouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n# **Palace Nouns: What to expect**\n\nThe special line is a connection to the “new” and will feature easter eggs throughout to make each piece truly special. The icing on the cake? Palace will launch women's ready-to-wear designs, making this collaboration one for all genders. The build will be designed to be a capsule of 5 distinct items. Because both aesthetics have been merged, expect logos to do the same.\n\nOn Palace’s classics – we're talking tracksuits, jeans, football shirts, skate decks – you'll see the Nouns identity scattered throughout. You’ll see this synergy on other more luxurious pieces, like a shearling jacket, as well as other unusual collectibles.\n\nAnother surprise for collectors is noggles Palace – a witty homage to the ‘weird’ collection, if you will. The idea came up and its design is about to be created as a double brand, wrapped in the Palace Nouns monogram.\n\n## Palace Nouns: What will be delivered with the execution of phases two and one\n\nEntitled “Palace Nouns,” the capsule – comprises statement-making garments designed for the collaboration. Jackets, noogles palace, vests, and skateboard decks are some of the pieces that are designed to be present, all adorning the new graphics, intertwined with the unmistakable details of Palace and Nouns.\n\nGlobal communication, Palace maintains a standardization of communication between its clients to build and launch a new collaboration; In their coverage, many media outlets go into significant detail about their collaborations and make them public globally.\n\n• Looking ahead: Building a capsule\n\nA capsule collection is essentially a condensed version of a designer's vision/collaboration, often in limited edition, that transcends seasons and trends by being functional. Thus, focusing on building and delivering key looks, without the style and theatricality of a fashion show.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/5qLsHLr.jpg)\n\n**Nouns Palace will be a 5-item capsule.**\n\n**a % (percentage) of collection sales will be directed to the NounsDAO Treasury.**\n\n## Building in public\n\n**There is no precedent for similar proposals in Nouns**, a collaboration like this creates demand for interaction and content that can be used by other builders and future collaborations.\n\nMany of the processes built to reach an agreement with a corporate are extremely tiring and even building their direction and a good presentation, most corporations prioritize closed and legal agreements to add clauses and prioritize their Intellectual Property.\n\n• Create a [general structure](https://mirror.xyz/0x905Ca7a9479EA1B9a8CDeD74da98e3CC5E6E2949) together with lawyer consulting to detail the collaboration and develop material to serve as a reference for other builders.\n\n• Unfortunately, the fashion collaborations have had terrible results in Nouns. What makes this different?\n\nYes, we are aware that we have seen several proposals without any results, this creates a history for the community to reject future approaches in the same segment, but the work we are building is extremely detailed to avoid any interruption or lack of communication. Open and detailed communication framework, creation of the capsule aimed at the general public and construction of an official approach.\n\nBuilding an official approach aims to contain everything that is expected from collaboration and has never been met;\n\n•Campaign\n•Communication published on the Palace's official social media containing a pre-announcement of the launch date.\n•Sending email newsletters to existing customers, with previews of collaboration lookbooks.\n•Mainstream coverage, Palace is known for the buzz it creates when announcing its collaborations, due to the coverage and attention its clients and media outlets create.\n\nCollaboration is the combination of numbers and audience as well as the introduction to a new group of clients. **When we mention that there are no precedents built for Nouns, we reaffirm.**\n\n**Accountability**\n\nForm a Steering Committee: composed of [DeGenData](https://twitter.com/degendata), [Ccarella](https://twitter.com/ccarella), [Oni-apenoun](https://twitter.com/apenoun) and 1 other noun who have intimate knowledge of the brands present in the collaboration.\n\nProvide this committee with **frequent updates on clauses, legal terms, construction and execution of the collaboration.**\n\n[Supriyo](https://twitter.com/next_roy) and [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi) also made themselves available to help us by monitoring the execution of the collaboration framework and giving us closer feedback.\n\n# **What has been done so far?**\n\nWhat has been done so far?\n\nThe Synthetic project is somewhat similar to Nouns, they are both test projects, so the constant change is aimed at future research and long-term construction.\n\nSome of our achievements and experiments during this period;\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/fYjLkWZ.jpg)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/YbbKqSa.jpg)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/QXeZfjv.jpg)\n\nIn several of our experiments with DAO we had constructions just for the meme without considering the funding request.\n\nA document is being built on the mirror detailing our experiments and will be available on our [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/synthetic_eth)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/aQHXdNh.jpg)\n\n# **FAQ**\n\n• Will there be any activation exclusively for noun holders?\n\nYes, In short - we will be designing the capsule with a variety of nouns specific perks in mind. Details will be defined during the ideation of the capsule.\n\n• Will the capsule be made available globally?\n\nYes, with the exception of one item that will be available exclusively in certain regions.\n\n• Will sales also be available in physical stores?\n\nNouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n• Does this proposal cover actually creating the capsule? So the end result is ultimately Palace x Nouns clothes I can buy online?\n\nThis proposal covers the consolidation of legal terms, as well as the construction of the idealization/concept for creating the capsule. The construction with already defined direction and execution of the capsule will start in phase two (second support).\n\n## Funding Request\n\nOperations & Admin Compensation - €47.000\n\n• Compensation + fees for 4 Months of two full-time synthetic team members. €37.600\n**(€4700 per member/month)**\n\n• Legal expenses - €15400\nLawyer consulting on clauses clauses established by Palace\n\nTotal =\n**€62400**\n\n# **Conclusion**\n    \n• A collaboration is being established between Palace and Nouns.\n\n• The request for this support covers compensation for the next four months of the team and legal processes and the construction of the ideation and detailing of the designer's capsule/collection.\n\n• There is no physical delivery of this support.\n\n• Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace project team.\n\n• The importance of this collaboration for Nouns is absolute, where you have a conversation between two audiences, one of which is global.\n\n• The specific amount of mass production of capsule items is still under study and will be detailed in the second support raised for the second phase.\n\n\n# **Team:**\n\n[Synthetic](https://twitter.com/synthetic_eth): project dedicated to the creation and transmission connections. Through this model, Synthetic has already contributed to five projects for the Nouns.\n\n**Considering the inopportune timing and where much of the attention is being directed towards the fork. This proposal has been restudied and rewritten a few times in the last week with feedback from the community and the committee itself considering the current market.**\n\n**Questions or comments?

We are seeking funding to expand our actions in three complementary strategic directions:\n\n1) New regions 📍\n2) Proper marketing in Brazil 🇧🇷\n3) New product categories 👀\n\n**1) New regions 📍**\n‎ \n![](https://i.imgur.com/4iKllzi.png)\n‎ \nNarcose is already part of a network of regular collaborative breweries, through which it markets its beers in the US and Europe. We will take Public Good Beer to these markets, also integrating them into our onboarding ecosystem and turning them into real Nouns builders.\n\nWe are asking for 4350 USDC for label printing, marketing material, initial beer production (minimum 1500 cans/bottles), and aftermovies/content production FOR EACH of our partners:\n\n**Canil** (Portugal) 🇵🇹 - already committed to 1500 bottles and will launch in October, ahead of various crypto events such as ZKdevsummit, Dune Con, ETH Lisbon, EBS2023, Nearcon and Web Summit, all happening in November.\n\n**Stillwater Brewery** (Seattle) 🇺🇸\n**Against the Grain** (Kentucky) 🇺🇸\n**Wooden Ship** (Minneapolis) 🇺🇸\n**Brewski** (Sweden) 🇸🇪\n**Bierol** (Austria) 🇦🇹\n\nIf breweries exclusively produce the subsidized batch, Nouns' maximum cost per can or bottle, which includes premium beer, label printing, a launch event, and ongoing marketing and sales throughout the batch, is only 2.90 USD. Should the brewery opt for a larger batch, as is the case in Brazil, or produce a second batch independently, this cost significantly decreases.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of the funding goes beyond a single event. It serves as a **catalyst for wider influence and regular integration of Nouns into everyday culture.** This is evident in the growing number of [reviews](https://untappd.com/b/cervejaria-narcose-public-good-ipa/5389905) on the popular Untappd app (over 70 to date), spontaneous shares on social media, adoption by various Gnars-related activities in Brazil, featuring in the Nounish Punk game, and our successful production management in Portugal.\n\n👉 **Accelerating Public Good Beer expansion not only brings legitimacy but also sustains a lasting cultural impact for Nouns.**\n\n**BUDGET: 6x 4350 = 26100 USDC**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jvG8dTb.png)\n‎ \n**2) Proper marketing in Brazil 🇧🇷**\n‎ \nInternational expansion will not be instantaneous, as it demands a free schedule in the industry. In this period, we take advantage of the remaining inventory of over 3000 cans produced. \n\nDespite the success of Phase 1, we believe we haven’t reached the full IRL proliferation potential for such a pioneer project. We had 0.5 ETH for everything (sub-300 cans and a very short-scale marketing activation). Thus, the proposed expansion would bring the deserved impact and tons of resources for further promotion of the Nouniverse.\n\nWe are requesting 4350 USDC per quarter for the next six months to fund the activities below. We commit to at least one IRL event every quarter, but given the rapid growth of the Nouns community in Brazil, we anticipate numerous opportunities to engage with new fans.\n\n- Public Good Beer distribution\n- Marketing materials (shirts, stickers, temporary tattoos, and more)\n- Brand activations\n- Professional media production\n\n**BUDGET: 2x 4350 = 8700 USDC**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5JpkcCz.gif)\n‎\n**3) New product categories 👀**\n‎ \nBeyond beer, we have the opportunity to extend the portfolio to two synergic brands/categories:\n\na) BBQ sauces - for the weekly beer-fueled barbecues we do in Brazil; and\nb) Sunscreen - for our community along 7637 km of coastline, with bikinis, surf stars, and sunglasses ⌐◨-◨ \n\nWe would like to allocate a total budget of 5000 USDC for working on this as the project progresses. Alongside this, we also have the coordination and maintenance of the activities during the period of six months at a cost of 6000 USDC.\n\n**BUDGET: 11000 USDC**\n‎ \n## Roadmap\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/S9KqgmZ.png)\n‎ \n## Team\n\nfabioseva.eth\njp.⌐◨-◨ \n\nWe are very excited to keep spreading the cc0 culture and bringing companies on board with us.

In Nounish DAO fashion, 1 daily NFT = 1 vote,  will determine NFTR funding initiatives. In return for the funding, Nouns DAO will receive 10% of the supply in perpetuity. In addition, NFTR will direct 5% of daily auction proceeds to the Nouns DAO treasury up to 80 ETH.\n\nNFTR allows naming any ERC-721 with a globally unique name across all Ethereum.\n\nNFTR DAO will eternally proliferate Nouns as sponsor of the NFT Naming standard. \n\nThe up and coming standard -- [ERC-6551](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551)’s Token-Bound Accounts turn NFTs into active onchain identities that can do anything an EOA / smart contract wallet can do. Active NFTs and their accounts need human-readable names for reference and reach.\n\nThis initiative expands Nouns’ addressable market to **all NFT holders**.\n\n# Who's Behind NFTR?\n\n[DigitalOil](https://x.com/0xdigitaloil) is the founder and CEO of [NFTR](https://nftr.name). Team includes 1 BD lead, COO, 2 more devs, and a designer. Development began in Q3 2021. Before going full-time web3, DigitalOil was an iOS developer, satcom engineer, and logistics business executive. He was behind [Prop 199](https://nouns.wtf/vote/199) and worked on [Private Voting](https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint/3976) (recently won the Nouns Private Voting contest) Research funded by Nouns. DigitalOil also recently founded [The Panama DAO](https://twitter.com/ThePanamaDAO), in the image of Nouns DAO, which was pre-seeded 1 ETH by [Nouns Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round:-12/2166) and subsequently seeded 20 ETH by a [Builder DAO Incubator round](https://prop.house/builder/dao-incubator-round-2).\n\nFor more on DigitalOil’s thoughts about Nouns, please refer to his Nouns Agora statement.\n\nNote that DigitalOil has fronted all NFTR founding expenses (over $400k worth) since inception, ~19 months ago. NFTR has never raised seed funding.\n\n# What is NFTR?\n\nNFTR (NFT Registry) is a universal, permissionless NFT Naming Registry on Ethereum.\n\nNFTR allows naming any ERC721 with a globally unique name across all NFTs.\n\nIt's comparable (albeit different architecturally) to ENS for naming NFTs instead of wallets.\n \nNaming an NFT grants the NFT a NFTR Profile with soon to be integrated ERC-6551 functionality (a new standard for Token Bound Accounts) and extensive utility. \n\nNFTR provides an API so that any platform can pull and display names alongside NFTs.\n\nFor more details on protocol architecture, visit [NFTR.name](https://nftr.name) to view our [Docs](https://docs.nftr.name), try our live dApp, view NFTR Profiles at [name].NFTR.name, or engage on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/frMSHsAvay).\n\n![*Nouns that have been named on NFTR.

Allows for the first time for an NFT to point to a social media identity, inter-relating them both ways.*\n\nIntegration of ERC-6551 features will operate a named NFT’s TBAs (Token-Bound Accounts) and associate them with a subdomain, making the TBA reachable by referring to the subdomain (e.g. banking.DigitalOil.nftr).\n\n![The NFTR Name Marketplace allows for trading NFT names.](https://i.imgur.com/UnUzHIP.png)\n*The NFTR Name Marketplace allows for trading NFT names.*\n\nAs an extension of an NFT's naming history, NFTR will develop the first NFT-event specific indexer. The indexer searches and detects all events related to an NFT, including:\n* Contract provenance\n* Mint date\n* Naming history\n* Wallet to wallet transfers\n* NFT enhancements / metadata changes\n* App specific events, like airdrop claims\n* Uses of the NFT as collateral\n* Using the NFT for some collection-specific utility (e.g. Mutating a BAYC)\n* Staking the NFT for yield\n* All of the above with the intent of making NFTR into the first NFT-centric identity platform, where NFTs become social and are front and center.\n\n# Why involve NounsDAO?\n\nDistributing ownership of the contracts and treasury of an Ethereum-wide primitive to a decentralized DAO is the ultimate proliferation of Nouns: perpetuating the ideal on-chain governance model.\n\nWe view Nouns as the purest instantiation of a DAO and are interested in adopting the Nouns DAO model for control and proliferation of the NFTR protocol.\n\nNFTR has been bootstrapped to date. A funding infusion will accelerate development at a critical time, facilitate NFTR’s first marketing efforts, and permit other initiatives to cement NFTR into its sensible role as a necessary and universally adopted public good. \n\nThe Nouns community is full of individuals concerned with innovation and the welfare of web3. We’d be honored to enlist your support and advocacy, both as a Nouns brand and as a collection of highly sensible and web3 native individuals. \n\n# ERC-6551 Integration + Enhancement\n\nFrom ERC-6551's [whitepaper](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551#abstract):\n\nERC-6551 Abstract: “This proposal defines a system which assigns Ethereum accounts to all non-fungible tokens. These token bound accounts allow NFTs to own assets and interact with applications, without requiring changes to existing smart contracts or infrastructure.”\n\nAnother quote: \"Each token bound account is owned by a single ERC-721 token, allowing the token to interact with the blockchain, record transaction history, and own on-chain assets. Control of each token bound account is delegated to the owner of the ERC-721 token, allowing the owner to initiate on-chain actions on behalf of their token.\"\n\nIf ERC-721s (NFTs) are to be so active, they must be simply and uniquely identifiable.\n\nENS, fundamentally, provides this service to Ethereum wallets.\n\nNFTR, natively, provides this service to NFTs and ERC-6551 Users.\n\nAs ENS provides limitless value and utility beyond reach/reference, so does NFTR. \n\n# NFT Name Integration\n\nNFTR Names can be easily integrated by ABI/API call into:\n* Existing NFT Marketplaces (show names below NFTs for sale)\n* Metaverse spaces\n* Web3 Games\n* Social media apps that display verified NFTs\n\nIntegrated NFTR Names are:\n\n* Quickly reachable by web domain at [name].nftr.name\n* Clickable, directing to NFTR Profile for direct interaction with the NFT\n* Interactive via NFT Messaging, direct payments, bidding, browsing NFT history, etc.\n\n# How Does NFTR’s namespace work?\n\nNFT Names are registered in NFTR’s [Registry Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc662a8ce36392d4b9489d0b59605a1874711bfc6). They are unique, meaning that no two NFTs can simultaneously hold the same name. They are NOT tokens or NFTs themselves. This brings the following benefits:\n* NFTR Name transactions are light (not gas intensive)\n* NFT Names are bound to the NFT, and travel with the NFT\nNFTR’s native name marketplace facilitates free in-wallet name transfer and buying/selling/bidding between wallets. Names are integrated into existing dApps via API/ABI call.\n\nNames are alphanumeric strings with no leading or trailing spaces, and are case sensitive for display purposes. But case-insensitive for duplicity purposes.\n\n\n# Similar Props\n\n**107 Verse**: Narrowly passed before funds were returned. Conflicted results due to purchase of equity in a non-Nouns project (Verse). Relation to our prop: NFTR is requesting DAO funds, not selling equity. NFTR is Nounish in DAO structure, and will feature ⌐◧-◧ in daily NFTs. \n\n**189 SharkDAO**: “I see these types of proposals as \"cultural venture investments\", similar to our @nounsbuilder funding… we just need to know whether a) we trust that the subDAO will steward those funds in a way that is positive for Nouns DAO, and b) if the cumulative ask is an amount of our treasury we are comfortable \"locking up\" until we see the cultural ROI from that spending.” Relation to our prop: NFTR can be viewed as a venture investment, though all funds will be incrementally added to the NFTR DAO, and their usage will be determined by DAO members (20% NFTR team, 10% NounsDAO). As a contributing member of Nouns and an innovator in the space, it can be reasonably assumed that DigitalOil will be an admirable steward of NFTR and its association to the Nouns brand and DAO model. \n\n**284: PizzaDAO**: Executed prop to fund PizzaDAO’s global pizza party, featuring Nouns branding and Noggle props. Here, Nouns served as sponsor for another DAO’s mission while perpetuating the Nouns meme. Relation to our prop: Not only will Nouns’ branding be integrated into NFTR’s NFTs and platform; NFTR’s DAO structure will inherently mimic the ideal web3 standard established by NounsDAO, eternally perpetuating the meme and the model. \n\n# NFTR Revenue Model\n\nMultiple revenue streams that will flow to the NFTR DAO Treasury.\n* Paid Namings (0.01 ETH, one-time lifetime fee, adjustable by the DAO)\n* NFTR Marketplace Revenue (5% fee of name trade value, adjustable by the DAO)\n* Daily Nounish NFT Mints\n* Golden Ticket sale fees ([GTKs are an existing](https://www.nftr.name/#/golden-ticket) NFTR-created ERC-20 that token-gates NFTR’s top 1000 names)\n* Fees from eventual advanced NFTR features (NFT Groups, subdomains, etc.)\n\n# How NFTR will proliferate Nouns\n\n* Finish building a web3 standard in the model of Nouns DAO\n* Nounish governance NFTs\n* Nouns DAO will become a major contributor to the NFTR DAO\n* Nouns DAO maintains a significant influence (10% voting weight) over NFTR DAO props.

Artwork was created by [Facu](https://twitter.com/facuserif)._\n\n---\n\n## Context\n\nEarly in Nouns' history, PH open rounds served an important role within the Nouns ecosystem. It was a place where new builders could receive a few ETH for their early to mid stage ideas with less governance overhead. It was also a way for the DAO to create open competition around a not-too-big commitment of ETH spending, and allow the DAO to harvest the long-tail of ideas rather than being limited to what makes it onchain.\n\nHowever, over the rounds, voter attention waned and PH open rounds started to show its governance weakness. Unlike onchain props where every large voter ultimately paid attention to every prop and voted when necessary, PH open rounds started to go largely unattended. What's worse, rounds increasingly ran the risk of being arbitrarily determined by whichever large voter decided to engage in a given round.\n\nAs a result, the PH open rounds lost much of its legitimacy and we were unable to continue funding through it. Towards the end, we were running 2.5 ETH single-winner rounds every other week, funding a grand total of 5 ETH(!) per month through PH. The last round's outcome—[Open Round 21](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round-21)—was determined by a single large voter as the sole voter of the winning prop.\n\n---\n\n## Proposal\n\nLet's kickstart the PH open rounds again branding them as the \"Nouns Garden\" (to make them more fun and memeable) and run a mandated PH round to elect 24 \"Gardeners\" to vote on the DAO's behalf in these rounds.\n\nRepresentative voting should allow for a more attentive class of voters to vote on each open round while the election ensures that the DAO voters still indirectly maintain influence over the outcomes of PH open rounds. \n\n## More details:\n\n**The Art:**\nThe gardener art work was completed by [Facu](https://twitter.com/facuserif) and funded using PH team's funds.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJyrigaCn.png)\n\n\n**Minting & Distribution:**\nThis proposal mints 24 Nouns Gardener NFTs initially going to the [garden-admin multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD94F65a9BFa4Fcb04FFbc0A64687667FcB28110e) managed by Noun 40 and seneca. If this prop goes through, the PH team will run the Gardener election mandate round. The winners will then be sent the Gardener NFTs which will serve as the voting token in the Nouns Garden rounds. \n\n\n**Gardener Selection:**\nThe Gardener position should be open to nouners and non-nouners alike and everyone that's interested in having fun doing civic service for the dao is welcome to run for the position!\n\nIt's desirable that the PH layer doesn't end up with an entirely disjoint set of voters from the onchain prop voters. Ideally, there's a lot of overlap and as a result the props that win funding at the PH layer will have a good chance of success receiving continued funding onchain if they continue to execute well.\n\nThe Gardener position will be re-elected at a 3 month cadence. 6 months or a year feels like forever in Nouns time. 2 months feels too frequent.\n\n**Gardener Compensation:**\nThe Gardener position will be volunteer roles without specific compensation (outside of the NFTs!)\n\nThere's a notion that delegate positions should be paid b/c reading props and voting is \"work\". However, not all civic service positions are better performed when paid, and there's also definitely fun and prestige in serving as a PH delegate of the DAO. This proposal intends to explore the potential of representative voting at the PH layer without adding financial incentives into the mix.\n\n**Gardener Voting Power:**\nEach Gardener will have the equal voting power (10 votes to spread across props in each round). If we start to observe bad behavior amongst Gardenders such as collusion or self-dealing, then we could institute quadratic voting where the cost of voting for the same prop multiple times goes up linearly such that it is harder to effectuate collusion or self-dealing. We're proposing to start with the simple voting scheme so that we don't unnecessarily introduce complexity.\n\n**Gardener Count:**\n24 was chosen as a size that is materially larger than committee sizes we explored in the past with NSFW (4-10) and DCS pod (5), as to assuage the concern (or perception) that a few people can be influenced to sway outcomes, while also ensuring that the Gardener election is likely to be competitive. It is not hard to imagine that we can elect two dozen worthy candidates. It is not clear that we could elect fifty. \n\n**Garden Rounds:**\nNouns Garden rounds will start off as 5 ETH x 2 winners (10 ETH) rounds every other week. \n\nTwo 10 ETH rounds a month still amounts to a very small percentage of our overall funding allocated through PH open rounds. We spent around ~900 ETH per month the past year, so 20 ETH would be ~2% of our spending rate. Ideally, the open-ended, lower friction, competitive, mid-tail funding the PH open rounds promise can scale further to be 10-20% of our spending, but we likely shouldn't start where we want to end up. We should scale up as builders return to PH and rounds remain competitive even as more funding goes through.\n\nOnce the PH protocol is launched, the DAO could vote on these parameters concretely. For now, we have to trust the PH team to execute these rounds.\n\n**Garden Funding:**\nNouns DAO has granted the Prop House team a total of 550 ETH over the last 2 years to direct towards Nouns DAO related rounds of which 160 ETH remain. These funds will be used towards the first quarter of Nouns Garden (60 ETH).\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\nIf the Nouns Garden is successful and continues after the first quarter, each quarter we will mint new Gardener NFTs such that Gardeners can continue to own their old NFTs as an object that holds provenance of their service. We would not expect Gardeners to transfer or sell their NFTs to someone else before the quarter is over given their reputation is at stake."},{"blockNumber":18189041,"blockHash":"0x595fc29fcbdbd37ecf5104f7d0bf6417353a515b784ce43a6a215133bb2c3e7a","transactionIndex":44,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xf801a2856c18720fc22047ed24b2e3f76b013e88322b4eddd1121038a3a92fcd","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":382,"proposer":"0x0658f4eD17289144717713ADfFC2539eF7c2EF8e","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)",""],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000a1b74d2280966a89ac7e0f3a8bc5f0867c776d9800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000045d964b800","0x"],"startBlock":18225041,"endBlock":18261041,"description":"# Bring a million shredders onchain (revised)\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeic7eqjinmflf6xdlcmczpihjt45us53x5hlpdnrjh55l32fn3ixke)\n\n📝 *This is a [Proposal 363](https://nouns.wtf/vote/363) revision, addressing feedback received.*\n\n**[Gnars](https://gnars.wtf)** proposes a strategic initiative to empower action sportspeople through communal funding, collective creation, and shared proceeds.

Movements > Marketing.*\n\nSkateboarding and similar subcultures, despite their rise in popularity, grapple with commercial overreach and value retention. Some of the most pressing challenges include:\n\n1. **Commercial Exploitation**: Outside brands jumping into skateboarding often prioritise profit over authenticity.\n2. **Loss of Authenticity**: Many skaters, due to financial pressures, might promote brands they don't genuinely align with.\n3. **Skater Exploitation**: Many skaters, despite their talent, don't receive fair compensation, especially considering the sport's physical demands.\n4. **Mainstream Misrepresentation**: Media portrayals frequently miss the genuine essence of skateboarding, leaning into stereotypes.\n5. **Skatepark Commercialisation**: Once-communal skateparks are becoming increasingly commercialised.\n6. **Core Values vs. Growth**: Balancing foundational skateboarding values with growth opportunities remains a delicate act.\n\nThe skateboarding domain needs a thoughtful equilibrium. Brands that genuinely get and respect the skate culture have the potential to collaboratively benefit both parties without diluting the sport's spirit.\n\n## 💡 Proposed Solution\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreiflj5bgctvmzjujul3kvehilbgrzcag7zhomomfdtrtbit4sptjym)\n\n📝 *Check out the [Meier Skatepark renovation](https://www.gnars.wtf/dao/proposals/3) proposal that's currently being delivered*\n\n**GNARS** as an acronym crystallises our ethos, mirroring the Nouns' virtuous cycle, acting as our serendipity engine:\n\n- **Goodwill**: Renewing skateparks and introducing new, shred-worthy sculptures\n- **Network**: Culturally sensitive contributions earn us both visibility and respect\n- **Advocacy**: Harmonising with communities helps us draw in new enthusiasts\n- **Releases**: Collective creative outputs with shared proceeds bolster funding\n- **Serendipity**: Getting onchain empowers shredders, opening fresh avenues\n\nEmpowering individuals to step into the blockchain world is central to our mission.

We're improving DIY spots and skateparks, making them better for everyone.\n2. **Nouns-Themed Sculptures**: Introducing Nouns-themed obstacles and sculptures in skateparks worldwide.\n3. **QR/NFC Plaques**: Simplifying onboarding with intuitive QR/NFC plaques at skateparks.\n4. **Subculture Expertise**: Leveraging our deep-rooted expertise to enhance Nouns' outreach in various subcultures, such as skating, rollerblading, surfing, bodyboarding, flying and other extreme sports.\n5. **Grassroots approach**: Empowering Gnars Shredders to engage their local community and organise meetups, beach cleanups and other forms of experiences that cause positive impact on their daily lives.\n\nOur target of onboarding a million shredders might seem lofty, but it’s just a fraction - 0.2% - of the 490 million participants in extreme sports.\n\nTo provide some perspective, skateboarding alone boasts 85 million participants. Industries like adventure tourism further validate our optimistic projections, given their sustained growth trajectories.\n\n## 📊 Budget Breakdown\n\nPer the TLDR, our ask is **300,000 USDC** to our treasury (DAO executor) at `gnars.eth`. We aim to replicate our success across multiple locations that arise through grassroots discovery and Prop House infinite rounds funding. \n\nBased on previous project expenses, we estimate 24 additional projects is an achievable outcome over the next 12 months, especially when focused on emerging markets where every gwei goes such a long way:\n\n- **Continuous park enhancements - 240,000 USDC**\n    - Skatepark refurbishments: 140,000 USDC\n    - Nouns-themed sculptures: 50,000 USDC\n    - Supporting Ambassadors/Shredders: 30,000 USDC\n    - QR/NFC plaques for onboarding: 10,000 USDC\n    - Miscellaneous & unforeseen expenses: 10,000 USDC\n- **Administration of funded projects - 60,000 USDC**\n    - Coordinate community-driven outreach and promo\n    - Discord moderation and general administrative tasks\n    - Onboarding support for grant recipients and builders \n    - Curation and support for new That's Gnarly creators\n- **Onchain (gas) and other expenses - Self-funded**\n    - Codebase maintenance, improvements and bug squashing\n    - Implement auction settlement leaderboard to reward settlooors\n    - Provide regular \"[Propdates](https://propdates-app.vercel.app/)\" to keep Nouns updated onchain\n    - Releasing collective productions atop zora protocol rewards\n    - Deploy open source portfolio at gnars.com ([GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/))\n\n📝 *Through onchain governance, we will allocate funds as earmarked. Finer details are laid out later in this proposal. If you've any questions, please don't hesitate to [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/gnars) for a discussion. We are here to help!*\n\n## 🗳️ Funds Allocation & Voting\n\nThe funds will arrive at `gnars.eth` which is our onchain treasury and DAO executor contract. It functions exactly as the Nouns DAO treasury does. Decisions are made through the usual voting process by [Gnars holders](https://etherscan.io/token/0x558BFFF0D583416f7C4e380625c7865821b8E95C#balances).\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifw3mcxausdmec7lkjd7dnpcwj6dxsfremcdweuil5nqr2oidixau)\n\nAt present, there are 3980 Gnars in circulation across 696 holders. We'd like to bring attention to the 8 largest holders as shown in the above screenshot, as they're very influential within the DAO, and have our best interests at heart:\n\n1. **[Non-voting](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0x0658f4eD17289144717713ADfFC2539eF7c2EF8e):** Instead of a founders' reward, 10% of Gnars are directed to the `shred.gnars.eth (0x06...EF8e)` multisig for onboarding shredders who are new to web3 and wish to participate in governance. Gami, who initiated the Gnars project, is instead rewarded in ETH as chosen by each bidder when placing bids in our auctions, using the bid slider. By default it's set at 90% treasury (`gnars.eth`) and 10% founder (`gami.eth`).\n2. **[Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami):** Hyperactive Nouns contributor, founder of Gnars, [Art Haus](https://art.haus), [Omega](https://omega.build), and author of [The Hypercommons](https://hypercommons.wtf/): A Manifesto for a Positive-Sum World. Visit his personal website at [gami.wtf](https://gami.wtf) for more information.\n3. **[Ric Burton](https://twitter.com/ricburton):** Early contributor to the Ethereum ecosystem and talented kitesurfer/kiteboarder. Has shown huge support to Gnars and has even been known to offer Gnars holders access to his beachfront property.\n4. **[Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi):** Perhaps the first person to arrive in the Gnars discord server and cofounder of [Alps DAO](https://alps.wtf). Showing early support as a collector, he's been an avid community moderator and wearer of many hats.

As well as receiving Gnars for shredder onboarding, it's used for proposal submissions such as this one, and the signers are as follows:\n\n- [Gami (0x38...fffd)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x387a161C6b25aA854100aBaED39274e51aaffffd)\n- [Benbodhi (0x80...87f6)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x80826180A2629206E3499B5167aaC8440E3F87f6)\n- [Blockbird (0x6B...4DDD)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6B67623ff56c10d9dcFc2152425f90285fC74DDD)\n- [Davin (0xdf...d939)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdfB6ed808fADddAd9154F5605E349fFF96E3d939)\n- [Vlad (0x41...be4A)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41CB654D1F47913ACAB158a8199191D160DAbe4A)\n- [Oni (0x91...2937)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937)\n- [22 (agreed to be removed)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E)\n\nSince no Gnars are distributed as founder rewards, all holders purchased all their Gnars themselves including Gami. who owns Noun 189, offering Gnars community the opportunity for delegation.\n\n## 🧭 Approach and Strategy\n\n[![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifkzcdwnvktxhmf47i67iel4gqyqtqc6jkhqc2xfxxqnfnmjr5dja)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3unXaYpMl8)\n\n📝 *Watch this NounGnarversary celebration funded via Prop House [on YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3unXaYpMl8)*\n\nOur strategy is multi-pronged, ensuring we address both immediate needs and long-term sustainability:\n\n- **Skatepark Enhancement Projects**\nWe've already showcased our impact: \n    - Opstacle (noggle rail) installations such as [the original](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0xb63306dbfe950dd9754d5edcf8f48c6ff9bdd32eeeff4c644cb90c974a3055fa) in [Praça XV, Rio de Janeiro](https://twitter.com/vladhzc/status/1660451083427143681) (Brazil), and others in [Nairobi](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye/status/1688473570119131136) (Kenya), [Domingo de Guzmán](https://twitter.com/PagesAndres/status/1632145699256016900) (Dominican Republic), and [Chicago](https://twitter.com/webgnar/status/1703201471255187565) (United States) with more to come\n    - Skatepark refurbishments such as [Skate Park Maracanã](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0xb6f1781ada377924f11500e81735dd60170984c7976a1267027b3bd67fca93f1) (Rio de Janeiro), [Gigoia Island Skatepark](https://nouns.wtf/vote/142) (Rio de Janeiro) and [Meier Skatepark](https://www.gnars.wtf/dao/proposals/3) (Rio de Janeiro) are great examples of our contributions and collaborations\n    - Nouniversary events in [Pereira](https://thatsgnar.ly/thatsgnarly/stories/femboard-x-gnars) (Colombia), [Niterói](https://thatsgnar.ly/thatsgnarly/stories/noun-gnar-versary) (Brazil), [São Paulo](https://thatsgnar.ly/thatsgnarly/stories/uncharted-waves) (Brazil), [Nairobi](https://thatsgnar.ly/thatsgnarly/stories/noungnarversary-celebration-nairobi) (Kenya) demonstrate our commitment to Nouns \n- **Operational Funds for Notable Contributors**: Recognising and compensating our most notable contributors for their relentless efforts, unearthing grassroots opportunities around the globe, and keeping thing running smoothly\n- **Continuous Park Enhancements**: Establishing a treasury for ongoing terrain park improvements, ensuring sustained impact and cultural relevance, all incredible catalysts for ongoing content production\n- **Intuitive Onboarding**: Implementing QR/NFC plaques for commemorative purposes and seamless onboarding of new members to our ecosystem\n- **Brand Outreach**: Collaborating with authentic brands and influencers in the action sports domain to amplify reach and earn the respect of our peers\n\nOur dual focus on the action sports community and local councils ensures that our initiatives resonate with authentic cultural value. We reject the zero-sum and seek out win-win, positive-sum outcomes for all involved.\n\n## 🚧 Project Discovery & Selection\n\nWhile we have showcased our past skatepark refurbishments, the future projects are yet to be determined. Gnars original focus was on sponsoring individual athletes, but we've learned that empowering them to uplift their entire community is far more impactful. We wanna help create local heroes!\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeigfvokrjnehnlajktaca4wnarcd322gb2srdgy6flfhx6izmxbfse)\n\n📝 *Explore our Nouniversary events with the new Stories feature on [That's Gnarly](https://thatsgnar.ly/stories)*\n\nSkatepark refurbishments and opstacle (giant noggle rail) installations have proven to be the gifts that keep on giving. Beyond our initial unveilings and launch celebrations, our creations are often seen across social media. As shredders become intrigued by our artistic installations, they are often inspired to capture and post tricks they perform on them.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeigfm66vmoqnarkg2fvgpyswwnio7wjupewbxqr3hytmk72tfbkkvi)\n\n📝 *One of many ways to see our creations surfacing on Instagram is [#gnars](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/gnars/top/)*\n\nThe selection process for which projects we pursue involves grassroots discovery by DAO members who are passionate about uplifting their communities. We plan to further utilise Prop House infinite rounds for rewarding grants to opportunities identified by members like those who've already delivered.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeif5o7iwfwqedxs645vh2fh3ktyeh2ojzlyuffqsdr6rwxuprhf3m4)\n\n📝 *Prop House works well for us like this other round: [1147 votes for 19 props](https://prop.house/gnars/noungnarversary)*\n\nRather than handling each individual skatepark refurbishment / opstacle installation as separate onchain proposals, the Prop House protocol will allow us to be much more gas efficient. We've been running an infinite round that funds artists to complete their designs that end up on skateboards ridden by Tom Rohrer in [his tutorial videos](https://www.instagram.com/toms_tutorials/). Once the protocol hits mainnet, we intend on being power users and believe Prop House is one of the most powerful tools available to communities like ours.\n\n## 🫂 Notable Contributions\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeihr7uy7fgb2pz6inhpphj4kknd2aggrzszfg3an4plyoyb2vs2mfe)\n\n📝 *Visit [roko.dev](https://roko.dev/) to see our sustained growth of unique contributing users!*\n\nWe have a dedicated group of contributors who've naturally landed to fill certain needs.

But, Nouns being cc0, we're uniquely capable of leaning into the potential of having multiple funding bodies, each with different approaches but individually highly aligned.\n\n**Isn't a lower threshold just making it easier for arbitrageurs?**\nIt is widely understood that we need to accelerate spending to close the arbitrage opportunity. Yet, figuring out exactly how to *thoughtfully* accelerate spending is a process that takes time. In the meantime, it seems like we'll be co-existing with arbers and should make the most out of the situation. Lowering the threshold increases arber competition, accelerating the process, decreasing their profits, and allowing them to drain less of the treasury.\n\n**Doesn't inviting arbitrageurs disrupt governance?**\nA lower threshold doesn't change that arbers will vote No on proposals and attempt to block spending. Conversely, it makes it less likely that arbers grow into a big cohort with significant voting power, which is a side effect of accumulating to reach the fork threshold.\n\n**Why not raise the threshold instead?**\nWhile raising the threshold might seem like a good stopgap to defend the dao against further arbitrage, it comes with an air of intellectual dishonesty and risks being [regressive](https://warpcast.com/vapeape/0xfc9dd9), while not accomplishing _that_ much in terms of protection.\n\n**Why decrease the fork period?**\nOne downside of a lower fork threshold and potentially consecutive forks is that proposal execution is blocked during the fork period. The fork period is decreased to mitigate governance disruption while still providing honest minorities ample time to coordinate.\n\n*Thanks to 40 and Elad for co-penning this proposal, and to Necfas for providing a Noun.*"},{"blockNumber":18199060,"blockHash":"0xda10ea3c41337c5333aa3a896034742f51a4ebbcdb6127aff9f118d510f509c8","transactionIndex":56,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x52aae321bf2fac87f461a5b692a8a19524bcfc82417e1ae78d2d1740e9dcff2f","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":385,"proposer":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","targets":["0x4756e5a5D0668195Feb1EC0e7F96832ffc51c4A8"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":18235060,"endBlock":18271060,"description":"# ## Nounishpunk Playable Demo\n\n**The biggest Nounish game ever in development**\n## Tl;dr:\n\nWe are asking 24 ETH to launch the **playable demo** in December.\n\nClick on the image below to watch the game trailer\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1DOskckT.png)](https://twitter.com/nounishpunk/status/1699797131211743252?s=20)\n\n\n## Description \n\nAfter experiencing the process of prototyping and designing various Nounish games, we propose that Nouns DAO collaborates with Genius Slackers to launch a playable demo of the Nounishpunk game on the Steam store.

Although we haven't even initiated a press release for the game, and without any external funding, we've strived to familiarize DAO with the world we've crafted, but we received encouraging feedback and it shows us that even with a small amount of support from DAO, we can make a significant impact.\n\n---\n## Who Are We?\n\nThe Genius Slackers team is an independent producer of video games.

Recently, I've seamlessly combined my passion for sailing with my deep affection for Nouns, crafting sailing events in both Seoul and New York, with the generous support of Props 102 and 173. Sailing, often hailed as one of the most esteemed sports, never fails to attract the attention of the media, guests, and local residents alike.\n\nIn much the same way that Nouns effortlessly align with cultures centered around skateboarding and running, they also harmonize beautifully with sailing culture. While sailing may be less popular or perceived as more challenging to engage in, it stands as one of the most inclusive sports, welcoming individuals of all ages, backgrounds, and walks of life.\n\nI am eager to extend my love for sailing to the Nouns community by curating a series of sailing events throughout 2024. These gatherings will provide a splendid opportunity to gather and share our ideas about future of NounsDAO.\n\n# Why Nouns Sailing?\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJjKkJqun.jpg)\nThe Nouns burgee flag debuted at the 2023 Nouns Sailing event during NFT.NYC, representing the spirit of Nouns and the tradition of the Nounish community. Sailing isn't just a sport; it's a symbol of dedication and camaraderie. Sailors are the ones we can entrust with building the legacy and traditions of the Nouns Burgee Flag.\n\n## 1. Sail with Nouns in New York Harbor for NFT.NYC 2024\n**[April 3rd, 2024]** Following the success of [Prop 102](https://nouns.wtf/vote/102) and [Prop 173](https://nouns.wtf/vote/173), I would like to organize a sailing event on April 3rd in New York with the help of the Manhattan Yacht Club. It is important to gather at least once a year to celebrate achievements, brainstorm ideas, and share thoughts. I believe New York is the best place for such gatherings. In April, it was an amazing experience to meet everyone for the first time in person. I think next year, we will have even more loyal people visiting New York.\n\n\n## 2. Support two Olympic sailors\n**[September 2024]** In 2024, all eyes will be on the Summer Paris Olympics. It presents a unique opportunity for us to showcase noggles during this prestigious event. Rather than simply purchasing advertisements, I suggest a more organic approach – sponsoring Olympic athletes. My hypothesis is that by supporting these athletes during the qualification season, they will appreciate our assistance and, in turn, proudly display noggles at the Olympic games.\n\nShould this initiative prove successful with sailors, we can explore extending our sponsorship to athletes in various other sports. My initial proposal is to sponsor two Olympic sailors during their qualification season. The Olympic Sailing Competition at Paris 2024 will comprise ten sailing events, with a total athlete quota of 330. Qualification rounds commenced in August 2023 and will continue until April 2024.\n\n## 3. Road to J/24 World Sailing Championship\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7uN5xdw.jpg)\nThe J/24 World Sailing Championship stands as one of the most prestigious international sailing competitions. Our preparations for this championship will span an entire year. By fielding teams to compete in the J/24 World Championship, we aim to introduce Nouns to a diverse audience with different backgrounda encompassing professional sailors, Olympic medalists, seasoned veterans, all-female teams, collegiate squads, dedicated enthusiasts, teenagers, and newcomers who share a passion for sailing J/24 boats.\n\nOur goal is to bring the Nouns community along on this journey to the J/24 World Championship! This event represents the pinnacle of sailing competition, and every sailor aspires to participate (List of J/24 championships - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J/24_World_Championship)). All teams involved will take immense pride in representing Nouns on such a grand stage.\n\nThroughout the year, we will engage in rigorous training and proudly display Nouns-themed spinnakers in various cities across Korea. We have identified some of the most picturesque locations, including beaches, islands, and areas with industrial landscapes.\n\nTo further promote Nouns, we commit to maintaining an active presence on social media platforms. Sending teams to compete at this prestigious event presents a remarkable opportunity to raise awareness of Nouns.\n\nOur dedication extends beyond the competition; we plan to work tirelessly throughout the year to promote Nouns. Regular updates on social media will offer insights into our practices, races, and maintenance routines. We'll showcase the elegance of Nounish spinnakers, whether in leisurely cruises or intense competitions. Additionally, we'll allocate time to master sailing maneuvers that may be less familiar to us as racers, such as figure sailing and cascade formations, which promise captivating visuals for photos.\n\n### Meet the Teams\n1.

This is a proposal for a (very) low-risk test to earn yield for the Nouns treasury by utilizing Origin Ether ([OETH](https://oeth.com/)). Converting 1 ETH into 1 OETH (they are 1:1) for 30 days would act as a case study to test that Nouns can safely earn high risk-adjusted yields for the treasury by utilizing OETH. \n\nOrigin Protocol is an OG team that launched in 2017. We launched OETH about 4 months ago, with the goal of making it possible for retail users to earn the same kind of yields that institutional traders earn, without needing millions of dollars and a full-fledged trading team. OETH deploys collateral to blue-chip protocols, distributing the yield back to holders daily via positive rebase. Current OETH yield is 8.01% APY on ETH, or about 2x that of the largest LSTs. \n\nWe have seen much larger test case props to Nouns ([Prop 320 for example](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320)); in our opinion this is much too large of an amount to test a new technology with, which is why we are proposing to begin with a 1 OETH test, and can submit an additional proposal in the future for an increased amount as the Nouns community becomes more familiar with OETH. \n\nThis proposal will include two transactions: the first to convert 1 ETH into 1 OETH, and the second to opt the Nouns wallet in for yield generation.\n\nA more detailed overview on the proposal and on how OETH works can be found below. \n\n![OETH Graphic](https://imageupload.io/ib/3Uu8NmrrBr6axiU_1695230390.png)\n\n## Stacking Treasury Yield With OETH\n\nPrevious Relevant Proposals:\n18 - [Stake 1 eth in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/18)\n22 - [Stake 10% of treasury in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/22)\n30 - [Stake additional 10% of treasury in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/30)\n52 - [Increase Treasury stETH Position to ~20%](https://nouns.wtf/vote/52)\n217 - [Stake additional 5000 ETH in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/217)\n227 - [Stake additional 5000 ETH in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/227)\n313 - [stETH peg protection](https://nouns.wtf/vote/313)\n320 - [Treasury Diversification](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320)\n\n**Summary**: \n\nThis is a proposal to convert 1 ETH into 1 Origin Ether ([OETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/origin-ether)) to test OETH yield generation for the Nouns treasury.\n\n**Abstract**:\n\nThis is a low-risk test to increase the yield of the Nouns treasury ETH/stETH from 0-4% to 8-10% utilizing Origin Ether (OETH). Converting 1 ETH into 1 OETH for 30 days would form a similar hypothesis as proposal 18 - in this case, that Nouns can safely stack yields utilizing OETH. \n\n**Motivation**:\n\nFrom proposals 18, 22, 30, 52, 217, and 227, it is clear that the Nouns DAO was interested in earning yield on the treasury and extending the project runway. Proposal 313 signals that the community would prefer to continue earning yield with stETH, instead of eliminating risk completely and converting entirely back to ETH. Proposal 320 signals that other mainnet LSTs can be useful for treasury diversification. \n\nThe OETH TVL has been trending upwards at a rate of about $1m per day since launch and has been crushing it in comparison to direct competitors with the yield we are generating. OETH yield is currently at 8.01% APY, whereas icETH APY is down to 2.94% and Cian stETH strategy is down to 4.02% despite taking leverage.\n\nWe are proposing to begin with 1 OETH, and can submit an additional proposal in the future to increase the amount as the community becomes more familiar with OETH. OETH provides significantly increased yields while also protecting against centralization and slashing events. \n\n\n## OETH Overview\n\nOrigin Ether was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC20 LST aggregator that generates blue chip yield while sitting in your wallet. OETH is backed 1:1 by stETH, rETH, frxETH, ETH, and WETH at all times; holders can go in and out of OETH as they please. Similar to stETH, OETH yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.\n\nOETH yield, currently ~8.00% APY, comes from a combination of:\n\n1. Deploying ETH/WETH on Curve, Convex, and Morpho\n2. LST validator rewards\n3. A 50bip exit fee is charged to those who choose to exit OETH via the [dapp](https://app.oeth.com/) (completely avoidable if using a DEX), this fee goes back to OETH holders\n4. OETH sitting in non-upgradable smart contracts does not rebase, instead the interest generated from those tokens is provided to those that can rebase\n\nThese 4 yield generating functions combined enable OETH to generate higher yields than holding or farming any single LST manually. The current collateral allocation and yield strategies can be seen on-chain at all times via the [OETH analytics page](https://www.oeth.com/analytics). Future OETH collateral and yield strategies are governed by [OGV stakers](https://governance.ousd.com/stake).\n\nObtaining OETH is seamless, anyone can convert from ETH, stETH, rETH, or frxETH into OETH via any of the following methods:\n\n- Minting on [OETH.com](https://app.oeth.com/)\n- Swapping on [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-298/deposit)\n- Swapping on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x856c4efb76c1d1ae02e20ceb03a2a6a08b0b8dc3&outputCurrency=ETH)\n- Swapping on [Maverick](https://app.mav.xyz/pool?chain=1&tokenA=0x856c4efb76c1d1ae02e20ceb03a2a6a08b0b8dc3&tokenB=0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2&fee=0.0004&width=0.001) \n- Swapping on [Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x856c4Efb76C1D1AE02e20CEB03A2A6a08b0b8dC3&chainId=1)\n\nFor this proposal, Nouns will be using [The Zapper](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/the-zapper) to convert the 1 ETH into 1 OETH. A second transaction will also be included to ensure the Nouns wallet is [opted-in for yield generation](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/elastic-supply/rebasing-and-smart-contracts). \n\n**Benefits of Using OETH**\n\nThere are a few reasons for why Nouns would choose to use OETH over of attempting to use the same yield strategies: \n\n- The yield will always be higher with OETH than if you were to use any of the same yield strategies, since not all OETH is opted-in for yield, and because of the exit fee. At the moment 23,731 OETH is collecting yield and 21,280 is not, so Nouns would receive this boost in yield from the OETH opted-out. With the exit fee Nouns would get paid each time there's an exit - occasionally this puts the combined yield into the 100s!\n\n- The Curve/Convex strategy would be very difficult (if not impossible) to replicate without having a Curve pool with a gauge + millions in TVL - Nouns would essentially need its own token and voting power and would be competing for yield with the other large flywheel token holders. \n\n- If Nouns were to do the same strategies, someone would need to manage the position. The OETH protocol would be that manager, with collateral reallocated among the whitelisted yield strategies each week. \n\n- The OETH protocol chases not just the highest yields but also the safest. During the weekend of March 10 when USDC and DAI depegged, it took the OUSD strategists/Origin engineers about 4 minutes to notice the depeg, and 16 minutes to start the process of moving the funds to a safer strategy. $0 were lost! \n\n- The OETH protocol covers all gas costs for moving funds between yield strategies, which is happening weekly but eventually will happen daily. With the price of gas on Ethereum, this could get costly for Nouns if Nouns were to follow the same reallocation schedule. \n\n- The cost for security - Origin has OpenZeppelin on retainer! Every new OETH contract is audited before going live. OETH security is prioritized over new feature development. The same level of security would cost Nouns millions of dollars in audit and development costs. \n\n- Top-notch development team - OETH shares 95% of the same code as OUSD, which has been live on mainnet for more than 3 years - longer than the Nouns DAO! The battle-tested code that has seen almost $400m combined has been and continues to be developed by a team of 10 full-time engineers. This level of talent required to maintain the smart contracts would be extremely expensive for Nouns, if Nouns were to try and replicate the OETH strategies. \n\n\n## Usage of Funds Generated\n\nSince launch, OETH has earned a yield of about 2x that of stETH yield. With the extra yield generated for the Nouns treasury, there are several avenues for using the additional funds:\n\n- Subsidizing public goods spend - Nouns traditionally spends ~800 ETH per month on public goods\n- Subsidizing Nouns marketing - this would offset the cost for future Nouns movies, paid promotions, conference expenses, swag, and Noggles \n- Subsidizing Nouns infrastructure and auction expenses \n- Subsidizing cost for collaboration with other projects - Pudgy Penguins is just the beginning! \n- Funding large team efforts for less - it would take 50% of the stETH yield to fund another Nounish or Agora sized team effort\n- Extended DAO runway - Nouns would extend the project runway twice as long\n\n\n**Community Cases for Increased Yield**\n\nI also don't think getting to our eth position to 100% staked eth limits our spending in any way… the ~500 ETH additional yield we'll get from staking the 10k ETH is not nothing. It's being able to fund another ~$1M / year sized team. That's like being able to fund another nounish or agora sized team effort, which is meaningful! - *Noun40*\n\nI think the DAO should maintain around ~6mo of operating spend as ETH… diversify into other staking providers to reduce concentration risk. Overall in agreement with staking more ETH to increase runway. - *cfeng.eth*\n\nThe income generated from holding stETH also amounts to ~500 ETH / yr, which is more than 2 weeks of auctions. - *noun12.eth*\n\nstETH is a better way of holding eth - *fugazi.eth*\n\nI believe there is already too much of the treasury being staked in Lido. I am not interested in staking more, and if I were, I would want to use some other protocol that isn't Lido since we already have a lot in Lido. - *onnnnnnnion.eth*\n\n\n\n## Potential Risks and Mitigation\n\nThere are six possible risks when using OETH, and Origin is making sure to reduce each risk as much as possible:\n\n*New token risk* - Given OETH is a relatively new token, some may be worried that OETH is prone to new attack surfaces. While this may be true for other new tokens, OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. Not that long ago, [OUSD reached a market cap of $300m](https://defillama.com/protocol/origin-dollar) without breaking, and without diminishing the APY it was capable of generating. Origin continues to work on OUSD, despite the lower market cap.\n\n*Counterparty risk* - OETH is governed by OGV stakeholders around the world. Everything from yield generation to fee collection and distribution is managed by a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts are upgradeable with a timelock and are controlled by hundreds of governance token holders. While the initial contracts and yield-earning strategies were developed by the Origin team, anyone can shape the future of OETH by creating or voting on proposals, submitting new strategies, or contributing code improvements. We intend for all important decisions to be made through community governance and limited powers to be delegated to trusted contributors who are more actively involved in the day-to-day management of the protocol.\n\n*Smart contract risk of the yield strategies* - Origin is only using platforms for yield generation that have a proven track record, have been audited, have billions in TVL, maintain a bug bounty program, and provide over-collateralized loans. Over-collateralization in itself, combined with liquidations, provides a reasonable level of security for lenders.\n\n*Collateral risk* - Origin has chosen 3 of the largest LSTs to ever exist to back OETH, and they have maintained their peg quite well since launch. They have also demonstrated significant growth in circulating supply, so the Origin team is confident that the 3 LSTs will maintain their peg and that OETH will remain stable to ETH. To ensure accurate pricing at all times, OETH is using Chainlink oracles for pricing data for rETH and stETH, and a dual oracle for frxETH that combines two sources: the Curve frxETH/ETH EMA oracle and the Uniswap frxETH/FRAX TWAP oracle. In situations where any OETH collateral falls below peg, [OIP-4 disables minting](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-dollar/issues/1000) of additional OETH tokens using the de-pegged asset.\n\n*Slashing risk* - Since OETH is collateralized by multiple LSTs at the same time, OETH is protected from slashing from any individual collateral LST. If there is a small slash, the OETH yield will simply decrease, as income will likely exceed the size of the slash. During a major slashing event, both the slashed LST and OETH will experience a drop in value relative to ETH, but OETH should not fall as low and for as long as the slashed LST, as the remaining un-slashed OETH LSTs will soften the blow. There will never be a negative OETH rebase.\n\n*Smart contract risk of OETH* - Origin is taking every step possible to be proactive and lessen the chance of losing funds. Security reviews are prioritized over new feature development, with regular audits being done, and multiple engineers are required to review each code change with a detailed checklist. There are timelocks before protocol upgrades are launched, and deep dives into the exploits of other protocols are constantly being done to make sure the same exploits don’t exist on Origin contracts. Security is extremely important to the Origin team. OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. All audits can be seen on [Audits - OETH](https://docs.oeth.com/security-and-risks/audits) , and OpenZeppelin is now on retainer. On-chain insurance protocol InsurAce awarded OETH and OUSD the [highest possible security rating of AAA](https://app.insurace.io/coverage/buycovers), of which only 3 other projects on the InsurAce platform have received. Optional OETH cover is currently available for both OETH and OUSD on InsurAce. Origin Defi also maintains a $1m bug bounty through [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/explore/), with a resolution time of 7 hours. \n\n\nExternal OETH analysis:\n\n[Llama Risk](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/asset-risk-assessment-origin-ether) - Asset Risk Assessment: Origin Ether (OETH)\n[Auxo](https://mirror.xyz/auxo.eth/1NXxHhJmj44EfHmvA5pEH7mpSLtg-CbYRqmuEkaTRRk) - OETH - Protocol Analysis\n\n\nOETH in the news:\n\n[Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/16/origin-protocol-enters-competitive-ether-yield-market-with-oeth-offering/) - Origin Protocol Enters Competitive Ether Yield Market With OETH Offering \n[TokenInsight](https://tokeninsight.com/en/news/origin-protocol-launches-yield-aggregating-eth-derivative-called-oeth) - Origin Protocol Launches Yield Aggregating $ETH Derivative Called $OETH \n[Blockster](https://blockster.com/maximize-eth-staking-yields-with-oeth-a-yield-bearing-ether-pegged-token-by-origin-protocol) - Maximize ETH Staking Yields with OETH: A Yield-Bearing, Ether-Pegged Token by Origin Protocol \n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\nPeter is a core member of [Origin Protocol](https://originprotocol.com/) and is joined by the fully doxxed Origin team and community, which includes hundreds of thousands of members and open-source contributors. Many members of the Origin team, including both founders, are holding a significant portion of their personal wealth in OETH.

[NDJ's Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns-japan)  has been a cornerstone of our growth and community engagement. However, we have noticed a decline in activity since our last round, Round-10. Consequently, this issue has been concerned many of us who see the immense potential in our local community.\n\nOne Major hurdle is the language barrier. Many Prop House events are in English, limiting the participation of our largely Japanese-speaking community.\n\nTo address this gap, we would like to kindly request your financial support to re-launch and sustain our Prop House for a period of one year. We believe this will boost Nouns DAO's brand awareness in Japan and create valuable content. We'll also look for self-funding options during this period. \n\n**Total ask: 18 ETH**.\n- Rewards: 0.5 ETH * 5 props * 6 times = 15ETH\n- Operations & Public Relations: 1 ETH/year * 3 persons = 3 ETH\n\n# What is Nouns DAO Japan\nPokemon, Hello Kitty, Anpanman, Super Mario, Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto, etc...

However, activity has slowed since Prop House Funding ceased after Round-10.\n\nVarious communities are holding Prop House, but unfortunately, only a limited number of Japanese are able to participate in other Prop House because of their poor English skills.\n\nIt is a great loss for Nouns DAO that during this time, talented creators from the character powerhouse of Japan are leaving Nouns DAO.\n\n# Prop House Recipients of Support\nHere are some of the achievements supported by NDJ's Prop House.\n## Nouns National Baton Relay ([Round-1](https://prop.house/nouns-japan/round-1/653))\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJssgkIyT.png)\nThe baton relay is actually handed over in the real world as “Noggles = Baton\".　This initiative will increase loyalty to the Nouns DAO by directly connecting people who love Nouns with each other in Japan.\n\n## pNouns ([Round-5](https://prop.house/nouns-japan/round-5/2027))\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1O-5WwJT.png)\n\n[pNouns](https://pnouns.wtf/en/) is an experimental project that has the potential to fundamentally change the social structure with ”real NFT” and ”real DAO”.

Our objective is to establish a new branch within the DAO, a more mature and secure space where artists can freely express their interpretations of nounish in art space. Simultaneously, we encourage the DAO to approach this topic with an open heart and mind. By promoting dialogue and understanding, we aim to challenge preconceived notions and nurture a more mature, accepting, and diverse community.\n\n\n\n**Note:** The project's creators have chosen to maintain their anonymity, prioritizing a focus on the project's message and artistic vision rather than individual recognition. \n\n\n\n# First Shot : Sensuality\n\n**Introduction:** In the world of art, sensuality has always played a vital role in evoking emotions, pushing societal boundaries, and expanding creative horizons. This proposal aims to investigate the profound connection between sensuality and art, while seeking funding for a project that celebrates and explores sensuality in various forms. By delving into this captivating topic, we aspire to craft a thought-provoking experience that visually engages and inspires the community. \nKeywords: Sensuality, art, community.\n\n**Body:**\n\nThe proposed project aims to create seven immersive art pieces, each representing different expressions of sensuality applied to characteristic nouns, corresponding to the seven days of the week. By collaborating with four esteemed photography artists, our goal is to craft a visual experience that celebrates sensuality and its richness.\n\nThese pieces will be thoughtfully curated to explore various facets of sensuality, including its ties to human emotions and the natural world. Through meticulously designed works of art, we aim to prompt viewers to contemplate their own perceptions of sensuality and challenge societal norms surrounding this often-misunderstood concept.\n\nTo ensure the success of this project, we are seeking funding to cover several aspects, including artist fees, additional incentives, production, and the care of these pieces. By securing the necessary funds, we can provide artists and staff with the resources they require to create impactful and thought-provoking artworks.\n\nFurthermore, this project aspires to extend beyond its initial phase. Future plans include organizing more immersive and expressive materials, enabling viewers to engage visually and musically.\n\n\n\n**Rise of Sensuality:**\n\nSensuality, often considered taboo in many cultures, holds delicate curves and unique identity within the body. Art, in its purest form, serves as a means of self-expression for the body, a visual language.\n\nAllow me to introduce one of the guest artists - [Guido](https://x.com/guidodisalle), a renowned name in photography, known for his aesthetic sensibilities and indescribable visual prowess.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/k4RMWal.jpeg)\n\n[Guido Di Salle's](https://www.flowcode.com/page/guido)\n\n**Minting and Distribution**\n\nOut of the seven pieces produced, only two will be made available for minting as limited editions, created by our invited artists. Details will be provided on each guest artist's profile when unveiling their piece.\n\n**Cost:** 7E to cover team expenses, provide additional incentives, and compensate the artists + 4 NounsVision to be sent to invited artists.\n\n**Conclusion:** In conclusion, this project seeks to explore the captivating intersection of sensuality and art through an immersive experience that can enrich our cultural understanding and initiate a new community. With secured funding, we can embark on a journey with talented artists to create a transformative experience, challenging societal norms and celebrating diverse expressions of nounish in the world of art."},{"blockNumber":18266735,"blockHash":"0x82344c5f6bcea02c9576d43ecc4214ab42284b17837681116a4b67f15d1b0a32","transactionIndex":85,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x6d32f45a30cf4f6136a6332a7703d478b7bdf3f53ea0e6d51b04308c4e201c70","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":393,"proposer":"0x387a161C6b25aA854100aBaED39274e51aaffffd","targets":["0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03","0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5"],"signatures":["safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)","sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)",""],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef710000000000000000000000003dfd76a87cf769275e5bc8c4ab77e47d50ecda49000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000021e","0x0000000000000000000000003dfd76a87cf769275e5bc8c4ab77e47d50ecda49000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000037e11d600","0x"],"startBlock":18288335,"endBlock":18317135,"description":"# Gift Noun 542 to Bob Burnquist\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeicmfhrpam75ycjyf7rjmvcern5f7ba4wn2xwlagryuyqq2jy2dreq)\n\n**Requesting Noun 542 and 15000 USDC** to assist with the tax burden of being gifted a noun, to a [hardware wallet address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3dfd76a87cf769275e5Bc8c4AB77e47D50eCDA49) retrieved from and owned by Bob Burnquist, the legendary Brazilian-American skateboarding hall of famer, and repeat Nouns DAO contributor.\n\n## 🛹 Meet Bob\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeidvgfdn65nvwugmodzlqumyvskclhpkjv5pdosdpe3rbwjqixz2oy)\n\n[Bob Burnquist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Burnquist), a name that resonates with innovation, audacity, and unparalleled skill in the world of skateboarding.

The goals for the burn are described in the blog post above by wilson.\n\nThis is a first draft of the proposal candidate through which we will ask the DAO to fund one or two audits of the implementation. We are putting it up even before we have quotes from auditors, in order to raise awareness among voters, stimulate the conversation, and listen to feedback.\n\n## Technical spec\n\nWe plan to deploy a new contract, with a single function that lets burn excess ETH from the timelock.\n\n### How much will be burned?\n\nExcess ETH is defined as the difference between the treasury value denominated in ETH, and: adjusted_total_supply * trailing_N_day_mean_auction_price.\n\nadjusted_total_supply is the number of minted nouns, excluding nouns held by the treasury or in the escrow contract.\n\nIn order to calculate the treasury value in ETH, the contract will consider only ETH, stETH, rETH & WETH. All other assets are ignored.\n\nThe number of auctions looked at when calculating the mean price is a configurable parameter; we suggest starting with 90.\n\nExample based on numbers close to actuals:\n\nTreasury has 2857 ETH, 10830 stETH, 228 rETH.\nAdjusted total supply: 394.\nMean price of last 90 auctions: 30 ETH.\nTreasury value in ETH: 2857 + 10830 + 247 (228 worth of rETH) = 13,934 ETH.\nExcess ETH: 13,934 - 30 * 394 = 2114 ETH.\n\n### What is burned?\n\nOnly ETH is burned. If the Nouns runs out of ETH, it will need to swap other assets (e.g. stETH) into ETH to allow for more burn.\n\n### When can it be called?\n\nThe goal is for the burn to happen at predictable times. One parameter will define what will be the first noun id at which the first burn can happen. Another parameter will define how many noun ids need to be minted before the next burn can happen.\n\nExample:\n\nSuppose the first noun id is set to 1000, and the number of nouns between burns is set to 100. The first burn will be possible once a noun with id 1000 is minted. The next burn would be possible once a noun with id 1100 is minted.\n\nEven if the first burn actually occurs when noun 1002 is auctioned, the next burn will still be possible starting id 1100.\n\n\n### Timelock upgrade\n\nThe timelock will be upgraded to a new version which will allow the burner contract to call it an burn ETH.\n\nThe timelock will only allow the burner contract to call it.\n\nThe address of the burner contract is a configurable param. Setting it to the zero address is effectively turning off the burn mechanism.\n\n\n## Audit costs\n\nOur plan is to undergo a deep code review with solimander, and an audit with [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/). In a bit more detail:\n\n1. Soli review (+ verbs fix things)\n2. Sherlock audit\n3. Verbs fix things + soli reviews fixes\n4. Sherlock mitigation review\n\nWe are asking for 30K USDC to be sent to the Tech Grants Pod multisig to pay for the audit.\n\n## Next steps\n\nFunding the audit will let us know the DAO wants the burn to be deployed. Once funded we will finalize the code, undergo the audit, and follow up with a proposal to upgrade the auction house contract and the treasury contract.\n\nThe upgrade will leave the burn disabled, since it seems best to separate the deployment of the mechanism from reaching consensus on its parameters. We will of course support any voters who will want to follow up with a proposal to set the burn parameters.\n\nIt's also worthwhile for voters to consider converting stETH into ETH ahead of the burn, since as mentioned above this simple design only burns native ETH.\n\n## Appendix: pseudocode\n\nExcessETHBurner:\n\n```\n\n// configurable params:\n\nuint numPastAuctions;\n\nuint nextBurnNounId;\n\nuint mintsBetweenBurns;\n\nfunction burnExcessETH() {\n\n    if (auction().nounId &lt; nextBurnNounId) revert('Not yet');\n\n    \n\n    allowedTreasuryInETH = adjustTotalSupply() * meanAuctionPrice();\n\n    excessETH = treasuryValueInETH() - allowedTreasuryInETH;\n\n    amountToBurn = min(excessETH, timelock.balance);\n\n    \n\n    nextBurnNounId += mintsBetweenBurns;\n\n    \n\n    timelock.burnETH(amountToBurn);\n\n}\n\nfunction treasuryValueInETH() {\n\n    return timelock.balance + stETH.balanceOf(timelock) + \n\n        wETH.balanceOf(timelock) + rETH.getEthValue(rETH.balanceOf(timelock));\n\n}\n\nfunction meanAuctionPrice() {\n\n    return mean(auctionHouse.prices(numPastAuctions));\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\n## Appendix: current asset breakdown\n\nAt the time of writing this text, [according to Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71):\n\n\n\n* Total treasury value is roughly $23.15M.\n* Its two main assets are:\n    * ETH at $4.391M (2631.493 ETH).\n    * stETH at $18.061M (10830.768 stETH).\n* These two assets alone make up over 96.7% of the total treasury value.\n* USDC is roughly 1.1% of the treasury, and we’re comfortable ignoring it for the sake of code simplicity.\n* wstETH is roughly 0.11% and is ignored as well."},{"blockNumber":18285030,"blockHash":"0xd44658cdeb5bacd34f747c153f172b103885128c50f46be2cddd4c930b5863f2","transactionIndex":123,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xf34e4dba0a4ef39f149b382579c22a2d3f17e66c6c89b9765d70c70729e8f455","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":395,"proposer":"0xD1EAeFBeFFD4106A1A166CD26a1Fe23140D6a42e","targets":["0x0fd206FC7A7dBcD5661157eDCb1FFDD0D02A61ff","0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2","0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2"],"signatures":["createStream(address,uint256,address,uint256,uint256,uint8,address)","deposit()","transfer(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000d1eaefbeffd4106a1a166cd26a1fe23140d6a42e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014d1120d7b1600000000000000000000000000000c02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006523428000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000659c8c800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000806a6cbeb8752a4973327da04230a02a12dbb5d4","0x","0x000000000000000000000000806a6cbeb8752a4973327da04230a02a12dbb5d40000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014d1120d7b1600000"],"startBlock":18306630,"endBlock":18335430,"description":"# Aburra (fka Alphacaster): Nouns x Farcaster\n\nTL;DR: Requesting 24 ETH for Aburra (formerly Alphacaster) to explore the frontier of Nouns x Farcaster and build a best-in-class web3 social app for the next 3 months. Payment via steaming.\n\n\n### Overview\n\nFarcaster represents a unique opportunity to decentralize Nouns communication and bring Nounishness to more onchain organizations.\n\nAt Aburra, we have been building at the intersection of Nouns and Farcaster since early 2023 and have won Nouns Hack Week for our MVP v1 in April.\n\nToday, Aburra has evolved significantly since its v1. In addition to being both a Nouns client and a Farcaster client, it allows anyone to host Farcaster spaces where listeners can directly vote for proposals.\n\n![Aburra iOS](https://i.imgur.com/Fm3kQS3.png)\n\n\nOur ambition is not just to create the best Nouns client, but to make all DAOs more Nounish by helping them communicate on top of an open and permissionless protocol (i.e. Farcaster).\n\nWe also hope to use this prop to see what is possible when you combine two of the best web3 ecosystems - we want to push towards a future where open communication protocol is favored over Discord and Twitter.\n\n\n\n### What Aburra has delivered so far\n\n**Applications developed**\n- [Alphacaster.xyz](https://Alphacaster.xyz) and WebView-based mobile apps ([iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/JLPtu4r8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.alphacaster.app) - to be combined with the new app): DAO-specific Farcaster feed, governance notifications, enhanced proposal pages with cast-based comments etc.\n- A proposal bot ([@alphabot](https://warpcast.com/alphabot)) to convert all props, votes, auctions and propdates into casts\n- Beta Aburra app ([iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/uLiAhdUA) and web): Been testing it for two weeks and it now supports Farcaster space with native DAO integrations (proposal and voting)\n\n![Nounish Emoji Reactions in Aburra](https://i.imgur.com/RQCt0fz.jpg)\n\n**Current traction**\n- Aburra has become the default way for Farcaster users to consume proposals and votes. In the last 30 days, it had 3.9K unique visitors. It also has Warpcast [integrations](https://warpcast.com/dwr.eth/0x3cec05).\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oT7WtK7.png)\n\n- Since we started testing the new app in early Sep, we've hosted 9 Farcaster spaces for Nouns, Purple and Nouns Builder. 80 users have installed the [app](https://testflight.apple.com/join/uLiAhdUA). More Nounish spaces are in [the](https://warpcast.com/aburra) [pipeline](https://warpcast.com/toadyhawk.eth/0x64bd48).\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rXUDxAX.png)\n\n### Plan for the next 3 months\n- Full integration with Farcaster channels, including reading Nouns channel directly in\nthe app (and in any space)\n- Phase out the old Alphacaster app and merge all functionality into Aburra: this\nincludes implementing everything (governance feed, proposal pages etc.) natively,\ninstead of using WebView, which will significantly improve UX\n- Better space UX, with native DAO features (NFT minting, droposal, smoother voting etc.)\n- Integrate with more Nounish DAOs (and others!)\n- Launch Android\n\n### Team\n\nAburra has 2 full-time team members, billzh.eth ([@billzh](https://warpcast.com/billzh) on FC) and blingbling.eth ([@16](https://warpcast.com/16) on FC). Both of us are experienced developers and have built production-grade consumer applications.\n\nSo far we have received 12.9 ETH grants from Nouns Builder ([9 ETH](https://www.alphacaster.xyz/dao/BuilderDAO/prop/48)), Nouns Hack Week ([3 ETH](https://prop.house/nouns/hack-week-developers-developers-developers/5256)) and Warpcast ([~0.9 ETH](https://warpcast.com/v/0xd74872)).\n\n\n### Ask\n\nThe ask is 24 ETH (0.2% of current treasury) to help us continue to build Aburra for the next 3 months. That is, 8 ETH per month for a team of two.\n\nThe team is lean and we are confident to deliver a top-tier application with significantly lower cost than comparable clients (House of Nouns at [95](https://nouns.wtf/vote/242) ETH, Agora at [220](https://nouns.wtf/vote/154) ETH and Prop Lot at [60](https://nouns.wtf/vote/244) ETH)."},{"blockNumber":18289407,"blockHash":"0xc0153e14a3b1b697f697e4a182a13523d436eb19789e494b06c0f7261b7a5192","transactionIndex":58,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x28571c8a836194f9f59725a842f74541eecc9bedfccf2b31c15a0c214df6b4dd","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":396,"proposer":"0xE26D78c6bFF297Bbc2dA3f80FEA9a42028a4260F","targets":["0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03"],"signatures":["setDescriptor(address)"],"calldatas":["0x00000000000000000000000025ff2fde7df1a433e09749c952f7e09ad3c27951"],"startBlock":18311007,"endBlock":18339807,"description":"# Update the Descriptor to Reduce Auction Settlement Gas\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal resolves a storage creep issue in the Nouns' Descriptor contract, which has caused the gas required to settle an auction to increase with each added batch of traits.\n\nA [new descriptor contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25ff2fde7df1a433e09749c952f7e09ad3c27951) has been deployed with a simple optimization that reduces auction settlement by 40,000 gas, and prevents future increases as traits are added.\n\nThe art in the new descriptor contract is identical to the descriptor that's currently used in production.\n\n## Technical Details\n\nFor those who are technical, you can find the full changes [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/804/files).\n\nSimulations of Reduction in Gas:\n\n- Before: [87,367 gas](https://www.tdly.co/shared/simulation/567299e9-05cc-4f10-ac66-6b71dceb3fcd)\n- After: [48,121 gas](https://www.tdly.co/shared/simulation/99ac1499-fb4f-4d8a-99e4-6c115e336f2d)\n\n---\n\nSolimander"},{"blockNumber":18294133,"blockHash":"0xfcbb07065e36ebadd8003d94b79b27409cab7c4229e9bc99d121207c595cde86","transactionIndex":63,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x280eea7e99c464f76f09b4ed510795cb22347a03f4d849fd6c757eccbc31e3e6","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":397,"proposer":"0x7549DCAad7d31af14DD8a4ADF7cF8241D04Fa91c","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5","0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)","","sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x00000000000000000000000035aa2666c8bc0aeb68ea64b463cf57a74bdbf977000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d18c2e2800","0x","0x00000000000000000000000035aa2666c8bc0aeb68ea64b463cf57a74bdbf977000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d062283600"],"startBlock":18315733,"endBlock":18344533,"description":"# Nouns Stories + Stoopid Buddy = Shorts Galore\n\n# \n\n# \n\n## TLDR\n\nOn the heels of [Prop 180](https://nouns.wtf/vote/180)’s and [Prop 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73)’s overwhelming success, we’re rallying the creative forces once again on what promises to be our biggest and most impactful proposal yet. Nouns Stories is seeking $1,795,000 to develop, produce and distribute over 50 Animated Nouns Shorts on a global scale with nine time Emmy-Award winners Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, along with 50 of the best animators in the world.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyIYuo7gp.png)\n\n[Nouns Short Shorts Trailer](https://youtu.be/QxrvHepTh38)\n\n## NOUNS: FRONT AND CENTER\n\nMost sources of financing for animated content are tied to networks that move at a snail’s pace and that are not considered artist friendly. This is where Nouns steps in to disrupt the system. We want to provide the proper funding to attract the world’s best animators, help them bring their ideas to life, and in so doing — put Nouns DAO on the map as the number one source for innovative, diverse storytelling in animation. \n\nNot only that, but by making Nouns DAO the seed funder we’re putting the Nouns IP (and the brand’s aesthetic) front and center on a series of innovative and hilarious shorts that are bound to get massive amounts of attention with animation fans all around the world. What better way to spread the Nounish vibes and garner some positive attention?\n\n## PERSON, PLACE & THING: 3 THEMATIC ROUNDS, 50 CREATORS, 1 YEAR\n\nOver the course of the next twelve months we’ll onboard 50 of the world’s most innovate animators to create engaging animated shorts featuring great characters, engaging storylines, and Nounish vibes. By expanding the run times and upping the budgets, we’ll give the animators the opportunity to produce even MORE engaging visuals and storylines!\n\nWe’ll roll out the animated shorts over three themed rounds. Other than requiring the films to feature Nouns characters or Noggles, we’ll encourage the animators to go absolutely wild with the best and funniest ideas: the ones that may not exist within the walled gardens of Hollywood. Because not every artist has the bandwidth to produce longer form shorts, we’ll keep the Short Shorts 15 second+ format for some of our creators. \n\nIn total the three themed rounds will feature:\n\n- 12 x 2-3 minute Shorts\n- 38 x 15-30 second Short Shorts\n- 3 original shorts by the team at Stoopid Buddy\n\n## 50 OF THE WORLD’S BEST\n\nWe’ll cast our net wide to onboard the best animators we can muster, and by allowing them the creative freedom to ***************do what they do***************, we believe we’ll get the very best out of them. Not only that, but many of these talented folks already have huge followings online which will further expose the Nouns DAO to their legions of fans when we go live with the shorts and the post them to their own socials.\n\n## 3 STOOPID SHORTS\n\nTo kick off each thematic round, Stoopid Buddy Stoodios will pour all of their Nouns-lovin’-energy (see: Rose Parade / forthcoming Nouns Documentary) into making something truly special for Nouns — a love letter in animation like only they can. They’ll tap their A-list Buddies to create and voice these fully original mini-movies, creating some hilarious cohesion to what promises to be a wildly eclectic program!\n\n## CC0 Heroes\n\nAs we did in the first Nouns Short Shorts Festival, we’ll encourage each animator to embrace Nounish culture by opting in to making their shorts CC0. While it won’t be required, opting into to CC0 will make their films eligible for some damn [fine awards](https://twitter.com/nouns_stories/status/1670029456688418818) and cash prizes!\n\n## OH YEAH…ONE MORE THING\n\nWe’ll be hosting a *Nountastic* IRL animation festival to premiere these amazing shorts, attracting Nounish animation fans from all over the world.   Why do this when we could just hide behind the safety of our computer monitors? Because as we experienced with the first screening at [Braindead Studios](https://studios.wearebraindead.com/) in Los Angeles (in conjunction with the Melbourne screening at Pixel), there’s an *energy* and *magic* to bringing communities together to share in a truly unique experience that will help put Nouns DAO on the map. We’ll invite all our industry pals, and will we live-stream the whole thing just as we did before? Abso-fucking-lutely!\n\n## IMPACT: NETWORK EFFECT\n\nThe first round of shorts garnered over **a million views** in the first month of release across creator and owned social channels. Most of these views were native to the creator channels of the animators themselves — providing a whole new audience for Nouns. This time around, we’ll not only continue to seek out animators with their own audiences, but amplify views across all platforms with a social media marketing campaign and enlisting a PR firm to bolster [awareness](https://www.animationmagazine.net/2023/07/stoopid-buddy-stoodios-chris-waters-unzips-about-the-nouns-short-shorts-festival/) of what we’re up to. On top of this, to build anticipation and excitment for the festival as the year unfolds, we'll create original promotional content, including teasers and trailers, behind the scenes footage, and creator profiles.\nCheck out some of the postings from our first Shorts Shorts Festival below!\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy2i70Kxa.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ctm_qiRBIre/)\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/By3o7AtxT.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CttDyBBo33G/)\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S13oQ0Yxp.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtgbaWPJ9iK/)\n\n\n## THE NOUNS STORIES TEAM\n\n**Stoopid Buddy Stoodios**\n\n9 time Emmy-winning studio behind *Robot Chicken,* and producer of over 1,000 hours of animated television **including: *Crossing Swords, Mickey Saves Christmas, and Marvel’s MODOK.* Stoopid Buddy is a pioneering independent studio that has helped drive the tremendous growth in adult animation over the past decade. Co-founder Eric Towner and Head of Development Chris Waters have deep roots in the Nouns ecosystem. Their first proposal funded the Nouns Rose Parade Float (seen by over 30 million people) and both are producers of the forthcoming documentary about Nouns.\n\n**Walter Newman**\n\nFormer SVP of program development at Adult Swim who oversaw such shows as Rick & Morty, Tuca and Bertie, Smiling Friends, Black Dynamite, and more. Walter brings network experience and a deep talent roster to the Nouns Stories team.\n\n**Goldy** / **Pixel**\n\n**[Goldy's](https://twitter.com/Goldypix)** Oscar-Shortlisted hybrid production studio is behind **[nounish ⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/nounish)** and the animated short film \"**[The Wizards Hat](https://twitter.com/nouns_stories/status/1570433066900017152?s=20&t=T_vYbAun_YQEsZUlEwfjSA)**\" from the original Nouns Stories proposal.\n\n**Joshua Fisher**\n\nManager of Grammy-winning music producers, music publisher, SharkDAO Rep, Ugly Noun, The Nouns Square co-founder, Nouns DAO Builder and Nouns narrative advocate.\n\n**Joel Cares**\n\nCEO of **[Lobal Global](https://lobal.global/) / [ANOA](https://anoa.ca)**, creator of **[Nerman](https://twitter.com/nermanbot)**, founding member of **[Nouncil](http://nouncil.wtf/)**, creative director @ [**JoelCares.net**](https://joelcares.net).\n\n## OUR ROLES\n\nWe’ve got the experience, knowledge, and relationships to successfully pull off this wildly ambitious proposal. Not only will we be identifying top-tier talent from our own networks of creators, but we’ll also be recruiting on a global scale to identify and onboard the next generation of up-and-coming animation talent.\n\nWe’ll be managing and coordinating a massive effort to create decentralized content and creatively package it in a way that connects with audiences around the globe. Not only that, but we’ll be tapping our extensive network to best position our exposure and distribution of the program online, at festivals, and beyond. We’ll be coordinating a social media / marketing and PR strategy, as well as presenting “behind the scenes” access and status updates to the DAO as this undertaking fully develops.\n\n## BEYOND THE PROP\n\nThe Nouns Stories team has over 613,620ish hours of experience in animation development, production, marketing, distribution and sales. Our team is well positioned to take these Nounish creations beyond what is promised in the proposal. Our hope is we can continue to develop the best-of-the-best beyond their existence as a short, and seed Nounish content and characters into the mainstream zeitgeist. Think about it — *The Simpsons*, *South Park*, *Rick & Morty*, and hell, even *Robot Chicken*, all got their start **********as animated shorts.**********\n\n## THAT’S A WRAP!\n\nAnimation drives cultural conversation. There’s a white space in animation that Nouns DAO is uniquely positioned to fill. Nimble development. Artist friendly. Global reach. We believe there’s a more “Nounish” way to produce the next great animated shorts, and that we have the team to help find them and make them. \n\nFor Nouns, there’s an opportunity to be front-and-center in one of the most passionate arenas in pop culture and create break-out successes that proliferate the meme.\n\nOur team has poured our hearts and souls into the Nouns experiment since it’s inception, and we’ve proven we can develop world-class animation and execute on ambitious ideas. We believe in a new way of generating content and organizing passionate communities of creators and fans. Together we can change the culture and build Nouns DAO into the next great destination for animation, so slap on your dang Noggles and let’s do this!!\n\n## BUDGET BREAKDOWN\n\n**TOTAL: $1,795,000 USDC** \n50% distributed upon commencement, 50% upon completion of first round.\n\n**Animation** **************Content - $1,270,000**************\n\n- 12 x 2-3 min shorts (3 rounds, 4 per round, $20k/short) - $240K\n- 38 x 15-30 sec Short Shorts (3 rounds, 12 to 13 shorts per round, $7.5k/short) - $285K\n- Three Original Shorts + packaging from Stoopid Buddy - $450K\n- Nounish Trailers / Behind-the-Scenes / Festival Recap Docs / Creator Profiles - $150K\n- “CC0 Hero” Awards (3 rounds, 15K per round) - $45K\n- Animation Festival - $100K\n\n**Management and Production - $430K** \n\n- Exec Producer Fees - $300K\n    - artist outreach and curation\n    - creative oversight and curation\n    - promotion\n- Producer - $100K\n    - Animator management\n    - Scheduling, Accounting and Deliverables\n- Web build and upkeep - $30K\n\n************************************General Operations - $95K************************************\n\n- Publicist - $15K\n- Social Media Mgr - $15K\n- Legal+Accounting - $20K\n- Event Planner - $20K\n- Team Travel & Accommodation - allow $25K"},{"blockNumber":18295251,"blockHash":"0x12ae5f562335b08e4f13de47b1bb140979eb23f61622d104bd27f915aaebc26d","transactionIndex":68,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xc1f67cbc2343e6132cbfb34d56f03ed0b3c6c32273f38fa1dd27536a28da8254","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":398,"proposer":"0x80212D1d03CB6A12b61cf5E98cA98D30C293127C","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)",""],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000006ccb83c907dbf0b4bc28f9bf83173b0ab943350b00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014f46b0400","0x"],"startBlock":18316851,"endBlock":18345651,"description":"# Noun en Scène (aka Mise en Scène with Noun 'Muppets') - TAKE 2!!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyewEPEla.gif)\n\n### This is a resubmission of [Prop 371](https://nouns.wtf/vote/371). \n\nAnd if you're asking yourself, **'What's changed, Chris?'** Let me provide you with a quick and handy summary up top: \n\n#### **The Noun Ask**\nSome nuance was missing in the previous prop. I love the idea of 'earning' a Noun, and since (at the present moment) there is no defined way to do that, I decided to build it into the prop itself as a way to indicate that interest. \n\n**This 'earning' is not, however, a transaction in the current prop** but will instead be in a future prop that allows Nouners to vote on whether a Noun is **deserved or not** once everyone has seen the epically awesome results!\n\n#### **The Story** \nSome of you also wanted to hear a little bit more about the story these images would be capturing and I'm more than happy to oblige because for me, it's the characters, story and nounish themes that are the most exciting things about getting to execute 'Noun en Scène'. \n\nI see the Nouns as little, innocent agents of change, who are chock-full of optimism and doing their best - pulled and directed by their noggles - to go around and help people, even if they have no freakin' idea how! They might screw up, they might not know what they're doing, but that's never going to stop them from trying their gosh darn hardest to do some good! \n\nAnd to explore these ideas, I did a fun jam session working on a series document and a pilot 'scriptment' (*neither are finished or definitive, but a step in the creative discovery process that gives me a jumping off point as we continue to develop character, story and themes*) for the nounish show, 'G◨-◨D INTENTIONS', that doesn't exist, but whose episodes 'Noun en Scène' will capture cinematic stills from, making it seem like this nounish 'Muppet' show IS a real thing: *[WORKING SERIES DOCUMENT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sNWmF0Lhlqe7bRMHra9EKHyoLSPr3B1CDIwSJJw8sTs/edit?usp=sharing)*\n\n#### **Distribution Clarification** \nThe main goal of this project is to get these images out into the world so that people can see them and get curious about Nouns. And I think putting these kind of high-quality, cinematic images in places where NFTs are not often seen (specifically billboards but  also super large format at a gallery show) will allow them to function as both **quirky advertisments for Nouns and high quality art pieces that connect with people outside of this space**. \n\nThere is not, however, an ask for funds for the billboards or gallery rentals in this prop because I intend to do a **Droposal** afterwards where all of the NFT sales revenue goes towards this exact distribution effort (Yitong, let's talk!). **Digital funding physical!**\n\nAs mentioned in the prop, we will also be documenting the process of the creation of these images, so I foresee quite a lot of BTS content that is going to be going up through Zora and socials (maybe we could even do a **Nounish vid about it??**).\n\n#### And finally, **Project Clarification** \nI could've used this prop to ask for development funds for a script and storyboards and gone a more traditional route, but **I think that the deliverables coming out of this being able to live as a **finished photography series/art project** unto itself is far more exciting!** \n\nThis doesn't mean that I want the project to end or plan to end it after this prop's deliverables - *I mean, c'mon, we're going to have two incredible Noun 'Muppets' to create with!* - simply that **utilizing funds to execute high-quality, finished images that we can use to make people Noun-curious in IRL spaces right away** is far better than having *only* developed material with the *intention* to do more. \n\nWe want to deliver something final AND ALSO intend to do more :) \n\n\n### **And with that...** \n**Please find the sturdy bones of the previous prop with these updates incorporated below** 👇\n\n---\n# **TL;DR**\n\n**Cinematic stills from a television series that doesn't exist (yet!) starring Chip - a cookie Noun - and Benny - a rabbit Noun- in the surreal, funny and over-the-top adventures they find themselves on while trying to do good in the world.**\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ1-5UUsh.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r17M9IIs2.png)\n\n\n# **TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT? WHY OF COURSE!**\n\nA single frame can tell an entire story. It can draw you in. Make you think. Send you tumbling towards what happens next… \n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyoqtGsuh.jpg)\n(*let’s put some Noggles on Roger*)\n\nIt’s what the best films do. I mean look at that Roger Rabbit still. What are Roger and Eddie looking at? What’s about to happen? And why are they handcuffed together?! Not to mention location, costumes, use of lighting or even the colors! There’s a palpable tension and curiosity in that single frame that makes us **care**. \n\nI want to bring that to a fun art project focused on a pair of Nouns - Chip and Benny - and their adventures in the - slightly (or sometimes *very*) heightened and over-the-top - world of ‘**Noun en Scène**’.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJmaYfou3.png)\n\nThink of it as a cinematic one-shot storytelling project that takes our pixelated, digital little Nouns, turns them into real life ‘muppet’-like puppets and then throws them into film scenes with flesh and blood people.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkwdXQiu3.jpg)\n(*cinematic scenes that make you ask questions and keep looking*)\n\nEvery one-shot tosses our sweet, little Nouns into a new dramatic scene where they're forced to deal with the crazy situation they've gotten themselves into by trying to help or do a good deed for a random human they've met. \n\nAnd through these scenic moments, the world of Chip, Benny and the 'Noun en Scène' project will grow, evolve and hopefully become something people want to see more of!\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJMTUmid2.jpg)\n\nBy utilizing ‘Muppet’-like characters mixed with real people and heightened, cinematically-lit scenes, the absurdity and beauty of life will become that much more stark, profound and hopefully very funny. \n\nTaking cues and paying homage to a variety of influences including Alex Prager, The Far Side, world cinema, the Kermitage Collection and many more, this project aims to utilize a couple Nouns to create captivating characters we just can’t get enough of. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1_riGoO3.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1dHszjOn.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkX_jzi_h.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1CuBtIjh.jpg)\n\n\nChip and Benny are just a couple innocent, little guys trying to help and do good in the world, but instead they keep finding themselves entangled in situations way beyond their depth. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJCRRGj_3.jpg)\n\n# **COOL. SO WHAT’S THE PLAN?**\n\nThese shoots will be treated like an indie film production - the difference being that we are capturing **single shots** that tell full, rich stories while still requiring casting, makeup, lighting, location scouting/rentals, puppet styling etc. \n\nOn the casting front, while at first it will make sense to work with local working actors/models and friends, as the project gains traction and grows - or when I’m working on my next tv show - I think there is a fun way to bring known name actors into these scenes and add a whole other level of playfulness to the project. \n\nThe first step will be designing, modeling and manufacturing our Noun ‘muppets.’ **Luckily, I’ve gotten a very exciting collaborator on board for this!**\n\n# **PUPPET HEAP!**\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJrVNiKx6.png)](https://youtu.be/agxY_pJwo8o?feature=shared)\n\n\n**Puppet Heap** is a unique design and production studio specializing in storytelling through the creation of iconic characters for all sorts of media including film, television, advertising, theater, and new media. The company was founded by artist, designer, filmmaker, and teacher Paul Andrejco after observing the burgeoning pile of puppets that had accumulated in his Hoboken apartment back in the early ‘90s. Now, just a few blocks away, Puppet Heap is home to teams of artists, designers, writers, and producers creating character based narratives for clients around the world including **The Walt Disney Company, Sesame Workshop, and Nickelodeon**. Puppet Heap has been entrusted with the care, maintenance, and creative support of the Muppets for Disney’s **The Muppets Studio** since 2006.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyX40MsOh.jpg)\n(*Puppet Heap team on set of Imagine Dragon's 'Radioactive'*)\n\nPuppet Heap loves the project - *I nounspilled them* - and will be joining to design and create the physical puppets of Chip and Benny. And as scale and scope continue to evolve in their journey (we have big plans), they’ll be there, helping to tell their growing story - and all the other Nouns that come into play too.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJXG1rDp2.jpg)\n\n# **AWESOME! AND WHAT ABOUT ME?**\n\nMy name is Chris Martin - not of Coldplay, sorry - and I’ve been making independent, global film and television productions for a decade plus now - primarily in Korea.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HklvCzid2.jpg)\n\nMost recently, I co-created, co-wrote, directed, showran,and EP’ed 20 episodes of a show called 'Dramaworld' currently streaming on Amazon that stars well-known actors including Liv Hewson (‘Yellowjackets’, ‘Santa Clarita Diet’), Brett Gray (‘I’m a Virgo’, ‘On My Block’), Daniel Dae Kim (‘Lost’, ‘Hawaii 5-0’), Ha Jiwon (‘Secret Garden’) and K-pop star Henry Lau.\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryG2-7jun.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Dramaworld-2/dp/B09QWZ45Y1)\n\nWith everything I create, I try to lean into **a playful, magical realist tone that’s grounded in heart**, which is the kind of storytelling that I think is not only a perfect fit for Nouns, but also an incredible way to bring people into this journey of Chip and Benny as they go around trying to help.\n\n\n\nI love everything about Nouns - the ethos, the support for creative, weird projects, and did I mention the freakin’ Noggles?! - and have been trying to figure out how I could do something creative that furthered that mission for quite awhile now. \n\nThen suddenly, while wandering around a street festival the other day, I saw this:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkmKCfj_3.jpg)\n\n**And bingo! 💡**\n\nThe idea for ‘Noun en Scène’ landed fully formed in my brain! And I knew I had to make it a reality and see what it could eventually become!\n\n# **WHY SHOULD NOUNS FUND THIS?**\n\nStorytelling is everything - always has been. And in a world where we are inundated with ‘content’ online, a playful, quirky and precise project like this will be a breath of fresh air to stand out against the noise.\n\nUtilizing photography as a medium and consistent characters as the subject will allow fans to come back, excited to see where the journey of Chip and Benny will lead and who they'll be trying to 'help' next. \n\nAnd by staging everything down to the last detail, each photographic story that comes out of ‘Noun en Scène’ will simultaneously be a fine art piece, a Sunday (web)comic and continuous character development leading to a broader (and very Noun-curious) audience. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r12QW7iuh.jpg)\n\nAnd in the spirit of '**mint everything**,' we are planning to utilize Zora to **mint and document our progress** - design sketches, scripts, behind the scenes, etc. It feels like a great way to document the process of creation and build something creative in public. \n\n# **Speaking of creative, meet Benny!**\nHere's Paul's initial design for Benny:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1YB-Han3.jpg)\n\nArms and legs, oh my! With our puppets, we want to keep what makes Nouns distinct while adding a whole new flavor that brings them to life and gives them character. \n\n### **The (mis)adventures of Chip and Benny** \nBy creating empathy and connection with our two little Nouns through **visual storytelling**, the project will help spread Nouns and nounish-ness far and wide - just how Chip and Benny would want it. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJIwS910n.jpg)\n(*One-shot example sketch - 'Chip and Benny Check for- AHHHHH!'*)\n\nAnd we plan to have this first leg of the project culminate in a **fun droposal** that takes Chip and Benny IRL in eye-catching ways (*see below for a tease*). \n\n# **THE ASK AKA THE BUDGET**\n\nWe want to propose a tight, but realistic budget that still allows us to execute this at the highest professional standards, so that we can first not only prove the concept, but create something that rivals the quality of anything you'd see in a high budget studio release. \n\nWe want to go above and beyond everyone’s expectations for what 'Noun en Scène' can be because seeing is believing and we think this initial batch of scenes will prove the potential of building out characters in a uniquely nounish way and make people want to see where we can go with Chip and Benny in the future. \n\n**BUDGET:**\n* **$40,000 USDC (2 puppets x $20,000 USDC/puppet)** **one-time cost** for the design and fabrication of our ‘Noun Muppets’ - this allows Puppet Heap to design, costume and build out Chip and Benny in their physical ‘muppet’-ish forms (**to be used again and again as the project continues and evolves**).\n* **$50,000 USDC** production budget to shoot and finish (at least) 5 'one-shots' - this will be a fully crewed up shoot with actors, set design, hair & makeup etc. and the budget will be used to pay crew, rent equipment, secure locations, finish photos in post etc. (all the production related expenses)\n* **Detailed breakdown** to give a general idea of how the funds will be used **[HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yym2vm-ojk9sXjrwziRHCDY6VYrSZPva3XBaryZLFUY/edit?usp=sharing)**\n* **Potentially 1 Noun** - If the results are of a quality that Nouners think warrants it, I ask that **another prop be put up to vote on whether a Noun (Noun 483, cookie head Noun from the treasury) has been 'earned' and can be sent as a reward**. A big part of why I'm doing this is be able to participate more fully and help provide a voice to shape the Nouns ecosystem going forward and I believe becoming a Noun holder is the next step to that!\n\n**TOTAL BUDGET: $90,000 USDC + Potentially 1 NOUN (tbd by future proposal)**\n\n**PAYMENT ADDRESS:**\nnoun-en-scene.eth\n0x6Ccb83c907dBf0B4bc28f9BF83173b0ab943350B\n\n# **TIMELINE**\n\nUpon prop passing, we can make our puppets and be in production in approximately **2.5 months** and aiming to have finished images ready **~1 month later**.\n\nAll the while **minting our progress and creative developments** on Zora.\n\n# **FUTURE STEPS**\n\nMy aim is to use the project to develop the characters and story of these two best friends on their journey to help and do good - even if it always seems to go a little sideways - in a surprising novel and onchain way. 'Noun en Scène' as the first piece will allow us to capture cinematic moments that bring Nouns into the real(ish) world and, hopefully, helps people fall in love with Chip, Benny and their continued adventures.\n\nWhich brings me back to the aforementioned droposal! \n\nWhat better way to take this project out into the world than through a **Droposal whose sales revenue will 100% go to getting these images up onto billboards and putting together a gallery show of a select number of physicals.** \n\nMore on both those soon! \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJFGYFIi3.jpg)\n(⌐◨-◨'s *on billboards?*)\n\n\nPaul and I have a ton of fun ideas for where to take this and how to grow it, so we're looking forward to what we can achieve this go round while keeping our minds open to how it can be expanded!\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and look forward to making the world a little more nounish!\n\n**Time for Chip, Benny and their friends to save the world.

We want to set up a Prop House to fund public goods projects and artworks within the GLITCH collective and beyond, where the highest-ranked artworks will be submitted as a Droposal for Nouns.\n\n**Total funds requested: 25 ETH**\n* 10 ETH for the GLITCH residency (see below for more granular budget)\n* 15 ETH for the Prop House Treasury\n\n![GLITCH Community](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=126XxNSe_cLiVf0vE7tPmRHelc9c28-dg)\n\n# GLITCH 3.0\nThe GLITCH art collective is organising the third edition of its art residency. It’s a 2 weeks long event gathering blockchain / AI artists and engineers, collaborating on the creation of new NFT collections inspired by the notion of CC-0 and Remix. GLITCH is a unique opportunity to build new types of public goods, past editions have led to the creation of several protocols (e.g. REMIX NFT, IMPACT NFT) as well as an open source NFT Token-Bound Licensing standard to embed Creative Commons-like licensing conditions directly into NFTs.\n\n## ART RESIDENCY\nGLITCH is a two-week focused residency at an 18th century chateau in France. About 40-50 participants will be invited to create, imagine, develop theories, build projects and standards aimed at supporting a new creative ecosystem of open creativity and digital abundance in the blockchain art world.  The participants will be a highly curated group of creative and smart individuals actively engaged with NFTs, art, music and AI. The goal is to bring the right people, in the right place, at the right time, and then let the magic happen.\n\nAt GLITCH, we strive to empower people with ideas, visions, and expertise, while providing space for our attendees to reach deep into their minds and forge better models together. We exist to disrupt the status quo and to manifest positive solutions for society.\nThe outcomes of the residency will be, first and foremost, a tight community of value-aligned people eager to collaborate with one another, new collaborations and synergies in order to shape the world of tomorrow. The residency will also promote a variety of new initiatives about how to promote the value of openness and interoperability in the blockchain art world. Expected deliverables include new NFT protocols that encourage remix and creativity, new NFT protocols geared towards maximization of social and environmental impact, as well as a variety of collaborative exhibitions for NFT artists. All content produced within the residency will be released and made available to all under Creative Commons licenses.\n\nMore details about the third edition of GLITCH can be found at the [following link](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1xWfm3HfZJHDdlb8-7bhrVE4fWmNJDOhd)\n\n![GLITCH overview](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1EHB6ZJxOhGZOb1wWWz1YobCez6UViYop)\n\n# GLITCH Prop House & Droposal\n\nGLITCH is an avant-garde hub for blockchain art and innovation. We aim to utilize Prop House's pioneering mechanism to fund the creation of artworks and public goods that will be stewarded and/or mentored by the members of the GLITCH collective (artists, engineers, curators, etc). By harnessing Prop House's governance system, we aim to democratize the funding process, foster cross-pollination between the Nouns and GLITCH community, and support projects that contribute significantly to the blockchain art ecosystem.\n\n## GLITCH Prop House\n\nGLITCH will create a Prop House round for blockchain artists and engineers to propose artworks and public goods to be created during the GLITCH residency. Artworks can range from NFTs to physical installations; public good initiatives can range from developing open standard or open-source tools, organizing educational events, or supporting initiatives to promote the blockchain art space. Collaboration between artists, technologists, and other stakeholders will be strongly encouraged, leading to the creation of groundbreaking initiatives in the blockchain art world, and beyond.\n\nAnyone can submit a proposal for a new artwork or public good and request a maximum of 3 ETH. The GLITCH and Nouns community members assess the proposals and vote to allocate funds to the initiatives that align with GLITCH's mission of openness, collaboration, and innovation. Votes can be cast both by Nouns holders and GLITCH-NFT holders (we will distribute a GLITCH-NFT to all current and previous GLITCH participants, around 90 people total). Nouns and GLITCH-NFTs have an equal weight of one vote. We want Nouns holders to have a say on the selection of the proposed projects so that we can get feedback from outside of the event, to ensure that the projects that are funded are relevant not only to the GLITCH community, but also to other communities across the Nouns and NFT space.\n\n## GLITCH DROPOSAL\n\nThe successful proposals, if applicable (i.e. to the extent that they include the production of a digital artwork), will be proposed as a Droposal for Nouns. The proceeds from the Droposal will be split equally between Nouns DAO, GLITCH and the creator(s) of the artwork.\n\n![GLITCH people](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LWgWO67u5aDXgF7vP5rQej8bkIDPJL1M)\n\n# FUNDINGS\n\nThe full costs of the residency is **$60,000** (inclusive of accommodation and catering for all participants). We are requesting **10 ETH** to cover 1/4 of the costs. \n\nThe Prop House will fund proposals for up to **3 ETH per proposal**.

Herein, I propose to sell some treasury nouns at prices above the fork0-BV price. This initiative would provide individuals with the opportunity to acquire nouns from Season 1, offer the DAO a chance to expand the Nouners community, in addition to daily auctions, and generate additional capital for proliferation or burn.\nA committee of five trusted members will manage listing of nouns via a 3/5 multi-sig.\n\n## Description\nThis proposal aims to replenish the treasury and secure capital for further proliferation activities. Nouns had historically limited market availability, however there are indications that nouns are in demand; for example, Noun8 was sold for 49 ETH. Now that we have a treasury with lots of rare and beautiful nouns, I propose listing 15 nouns on open markets. This will help the DAO to refill the treasury and also attract new Nouners who appreciate the art, culture, and value of NounsDAO.\nThe committee members will determine prices based on market sentiment and in the best interest of the DAO. All ETH proceeds from sales and any remaining nouns will be transferred to the treasury after one month, which equates to 30 daily auctions.\nHerein, I propose the following tiered pricing for nouns based on their numbers:\n\nids: 0-99 at 43~51 ETH\nids: 100-299 at 38~43 ETH\n\n## Requested nouns\nThe sale of the following nouns should contribute 595~685 ETH to the treasury.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1VxBo_e6.png)\n\n## Policy and Rules\n**1.1** The 15 treasury nouns will be sent to the multi-sig wallet, which is managed by 5 trusted members.\n**1.2** The nouns held in the multi-sig safe are non-voting, meaning that the committee cannot use them for voting purposes.\n**1.3** Committee members will determine prices in the best interest of the DAO.\n**1.4** No treasury nouns shall be sold below the fork0-BV price.\n**1.5** The candidate proposal feedback section shall be used for suggestions.\n**1.6** The community is encouraged to propose committee members, and self-nomination is also encouraged.\n**1.7** All ETH proceeds from sales and any remaining nouns will be transferred to the treasury after one month, which equates to 30 daily auctions.\n\n\n## Multi-sig signers\nThis is a pro bono position, and committee members will receive a small amount of ETH to compensate for transaction fees only.\n\n1. __\n2. __\n3. __\n4. __\n5.

Born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Bob has not only transformed the skateboarding landscape but has also left an indelible mark on global culture. Gifting Noun 542, adorned with a skateboard head, to this skateboarding maestro would be a fitting tribute to his legacy. \n\n## 💥 Cultural Impact \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifoecnwfhetsm3zpkw5342ai6v4lckbo2xmo7nkww45idczou6mfy) \n\n▶️ *[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=wlL4NPOrYck) to watch the above video* Bob's influence transcends skateboarding. He's been a cultural icon, inspiring countless individuals to challenge the status quo and redefine boundaries. His Brazilian roots combined with his global appeal have made him a bridge between cultures, fostering understanding and appreciation for the sport across continents. ## 🧲 Media Magnet \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeidet2efui2mxkiduurct3x2m2nc4ggemgvvsdhsmogoyczkfqkwki) \n\nFrom video games like the iconic \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater\" series to documentaries and live broadcasts, Bob's presence in media is vast. His Dreamland series, which showcased his private skatepark, was a testament to his creativity and became a viral sensation. His stunts, especially the heart-stopping Grand Canyon jump, have been broadcasted worldwide, further cementing his status as a skateboarding superstar. \n\n## 💸 Charitable Endeavours \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeia4t4k2zg6g3ptxxdfisowu7reisskj4rr5jm6jmq2njj7xbqpmwi) \n\nBob's heart is as big as his talent. Through his institutes and foundations, he has consistently worked towards the betterment of society. From promoting skateboarding among underprivileged kids to championing environmental causes, his philanthropic efforts are commendable. \n\n## 🫂 Nounish Contributions \n\nBob's engagement with the NFT world and Nouns DAO is not just as an icon but as an active contributor. As a partner at **NFT Brasil**, he's at the forefront of integrating the vibrant city of São Paulo into the NFT landscape, with a robust collaboration planned in the coming year. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreigxcco4jkqhbtj6kphjirdxgmno3cdwv7u5tohu2yc2ftseipdz6a) \n\nHis social program, **Skate Cuida**, is a testament to his commitment to community upliftment. Through this initiative, he's been onboarding individuals into the world of technology, offering programming classes, and witnessing transformative progress. The launch of [SkateboardingCares.com](http://SkateboardingCares.com), a collective that's making \"concrete waves,\" is powered by [That's Gnarly](https://thatsgnar.ly) and further amplifies his dedication to merging skateboarding with technological advancements. \n\n[![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeidmc4oopw35og6e37gtv7fpppurjnfm3zcrjfurymgwf76rnyknl4)](https://twitter.com/bobburnquist/status/1604636743332159488) \n\nBob's advocacy for the NFT space is evident in his active participation at various events.

It would be a celebration of a legend, an acknowledgment of his contributions, and a testament to the indomitable spirit of skateboarding. We'd be embarking on a quest of serendipity together, where the potential for collaboration is boundless. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreicn34ghkmznkjyfn7zhbnyni73hwfmldaqhthpqivpi7frksopu2e) \n\nBob's committed to repping Noun 542 and participating in governance, as both a voter and nounish builder. His creativity and groundbreaking track record are testament to what he could, and already does, bring to Nouns. If there are times where his full focus is needed elsewhere, there's ample opportunity for thoughtful representation through delegation, either by his team, vast network with deep industry experience, or as part of educational endeavours at his institute. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeideeb4fbkn2i3s37fmq5tnkzr3krmi5l4wyza7sx7a2tcchkwddge) \n\n▶️ *[Click here](https://www.voxels.com/play?coords=E@1007E,1112N) to visit to Bob's Voxels property (got a tour on our most recent call)* \n\nI've followed Bob's career since I was a child, and as an amateur skateboarder, I'm thrilled to have even met him, let alone be collaborating with him directly. Gnars has taken me on such an incredible journey and Nouns has made it all possible.

Also want to acknowledge the excellent feedback from Noun 40 and Trent re: shifting the framing of Protocol Guild from glamorous heroes to tireless stewards / maintainers in the co-created universe of Ethereum. We will work that feedback in with The Line and post an updated script via Propdate.\n\n## Why support Protocol Guild? \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1yDWDxWa.jpg)\n\nNouns love public art and software, and Protocol Guild maintains the most important public software to us: Ethereum. We've demonstrated this in the past to the [tune of 500 ETH](https://www.nounsagora.com/proposals/108). Instead of continuing with direct donation, I'm proposing that we leverage our financial and creative resources to make a film about PG, and release it as a mintable NFT whose proceeds go towards the Guild.\n\nThis is not only great for PG, but also affords us a unique opportunity to use nounish imagery, characters and themes in a piece of media that will widely seen in our prime demographic of humans who love and care for ethereum.\n\nIt's true that \"donating\" via a mintable film is more risky than giving money directly – but I think telling the story of Ethereum and Protocol Guild through the lens of Nouns is something we can uniquely do. Other DAOs like UNI and LIDO may be able to donate more due to their larger treasury – but none have the mission and mandate to fund creative endeavours like we do.\n\nA successful $400k investment in storytelling can have a **broader reach** than our previous 500ETH investment and drive far **more direct positive attention** to Nouns while at the same time providing financial and cultural support to Protocol Guild. And we have evidence this can work, both from our [past](https://www.thisisnouns.wtf/) [successful](https://www.premiere.wtf/) droposals and the [Stand with crypto](https://zora.co/collect/eth:0x9d90669665607f08005cae4a7098143f554c59ef) mint.\n\n## What's the story we're going to tell?\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJuogvxb6.jpg)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/npgcssj0xy1xyid9utxob/Nouns_Pitch.mov?rlkey=z8cgbr02oza3e6wl1h3scv54z&dl=0)\n\nPlease watch Bjorn, our director, tell you the story, settings, and characters in his voice. We're working with a draft story and visual references, and will be refining it all over time with input from the Nouns community. Our current draft story is something like this:\n\n>This is a story set in a floating port town, which metaphorically represents the Ethereum ecosystem. Everyone is gathered to celebrate the return of the Protocol Guild, a group of adventurers bringing back innovations that will improve the town (metaphorically EIP-4844). The Nouns play host to these adventurers by inviting them to a big feast. We follow a young child who looks up to the Protocol Guild and follows them across their journey around town, in hope of meeting his heroes.\n\nIf you'd like to check out [the draft script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T1Gw8W74_9BR_o6ADetRxnyxza-SPR7lZdof9jTPslg/edit?usp=sharing) yourself!\n\n\n## The world and its characters\nYou should definitely check out Bjorn's video explaining the world in his own words, but check these images for a preview!

They've worked extensively with top tier artists and brands like [Gorillaz](https://www.thelineanimation.com/work/gorillaz), [Lil Nas X](https://www.thelineanimation.com/work/lilnasx-star-walkin), and [Marvel Studios](https://www.thelineanimation.com/work/hero-marvel-snap), and [Nickelodeon](https://www.thelineanimation.com/work/nickelodeon-vines). Our director will be Bjorn-Erik Aschim, who's also a studio co-founder.\n\nI reached out to them not only because they worked on a [viral Chobani video about a solarpunk farm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-Ng5ZvrDm4) – which I think visually and emotively embodies the vision the aspiration of Nouns and Ethereum really well, but also because they are one of the best studios in the world, whose work is widely recognized in the creative industry.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H11spyae6.png)\n\n## Funding & milestones\n**Funding**\n\nI'm requesting $400k USDC to fund this short animation. 100% of the amount goes to The Line to fund the development of the film. The funds will be released over 2 milestones: 1/2 upfront, and 1/2 upon completion.\n\nMilestone payment will be held in an escrow multisig whose signers are the Agora team and will be disbursed to The Line upon milestone completion. In the unlikely event that the film cannot be completed, the remainder funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\nThen, trent.eth from Protocol Guild will submit another proposal to the DAO to release the short film as a droposal with 70% of the proceeds going to Protocol Guild, 20% to Nouns treasury, and 10% to Agora. \n\n\n## What's Agora / Yitong's role in this?\nI'm incredibly excited about more Nouns-produced short films released as Droposals, because there's a real flywheel here if we can demonstrate that Nouns can create super high quality short films that also have real mint value. \n\nIt's why we're working on an [easy Droposals](https://www.nounsagora.com/proposals/346) creator at Agora, and I can think of no better film than one about Ethereum itself to demonstrate the power of Droposals.\n\n\n## Timeline\nDates are approximate, and may change by a few days depending on exact timing of the candidate approval. During the process, Yitong will serve as liaison between The Line and the Nouns community to make sure we have the chance to provide feedback during each phase of production.\n\nw/c 19th Oct - Proposal approved (PAYMENT MILESTONE 1 50%)\nw/c 26th Oct - Creative Phase commences\nw/c 10th Nov - Creative Phase Deck Approval\nw/c 16 Nov - Pre-production commences\nw/c 30th Nov - Edit Lock & Designs approval\nw/c 21th Dec - Layout approve\nw/c 21th Dec - Production commences\nw/c 25 Dec - Christmas Break\nw/c 25th Jan - Animation approve\nw/c 25th Feb - Comp approved\nw/c 22 Feb - Final Delivery (PAYMENT MILESTONE 2 50%)\n\n\n## A story in chapters\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryKSTlTeT.png)\nIf we're successful with this first film, we can serialize this into a series of short animations celebrating major Ethereum milestones so that we can both create an ongoing source of funding for Protocol Guild, and tell an episodic story that builds into a larger narrative and universe that can stand on its own and be appealing to a mass audience who might not even know about Nouns or Ethereum.\n"},{"blockNumber":18332676,"blockHash":"0xc5667554f8b77ec15a04ec2c99e5b31a12c7f7e582ef870ce4cad784322cd6bd","transactionIndex":115,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xc400f7a479e6501fd0087a3c12024779e32e3b51965f51a2772753b3ce55a753","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":408,"proposer":"0x7c1282a7621F0e2f6169E151628552A8B8a57B2d","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x0fd206FC7A7dBcD5661157eDCb1FFDD0D02A61ff","0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5","0x0fd206FC7A7dBcD5661157eDCb1FFDD0D02A61ff","0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x0fd206FC7A7dBcD5661157eDCb1FFDD0D02A61ff","0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)","createStream(address,uint256,address,uint256,uint256,uint8,address)","sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)","","createStream(address,uint256,address,uint256,uint256,uint8,address)","sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)","createStream(address,uint256,address,uint256,uint256,uint8,address)","sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000a8c14159c435e973fef0693358ecdd6e4ffe89d1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000342770c000","0x000000000000000000000000a8c14159c435e973fef0693358ecdd6e4ffe89d100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000054847c6e00000000000000000000000000a0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb4800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000659200800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000066303480000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000073aa3d1725186b342eda39692c6975ca0215347c","0x00000000000000000000000073aa3d1725186b342eda39692c6975ca0215347c00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000054847c6e00","0x","0x0000000000000000000000007c1282a7621f0e2f6169e151628552a8b8a57b2d000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000059682f000000000000000000000000000a0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb480000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000065920080000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006630348000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006dc04de8d949648ca5cbff5f6153aab1790ad3c5","0x0000000000000000000000006dc04de8d949648ca5cbff5f6153aab1790ad3c5000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000059682f000","0x000000000000000000000000b2333d61ff847148fe89901f34f7d9201cec25cb000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000059682f000000000000000000000000000a0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006592008000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000663034800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e1aa028e078dd9cbec8d2b6991c35286972cce25","0x000000000000000000000000e1aa028e078dd9cbec8d2b6991c35286972cce25000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000059682f000"],"startBlock":18354276,"endBlock":18383076,"description":"# First IRL Nouns Themed Playground\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryfDKFf-p.png)\n\n## tl;dr;\n\n- Construct the first physical Nouns Themed Playground.\n- Expand Nouns network value as an open-source brand & infinite work of art.\n- Disrupt the status quo and provoke how establishment perceives cc0 assets.\n- Allow organic interaction while capturing attention with charistmatic and value aligned public good initiative.\n- Develop a media documentary to capture the essence of the project;

Bidets can slash toilet paper costs, boost hygiene, and ease water infrastructure stress. Our pilot will provide Nouns-branded bidets to low-to-middle-income families, complete with DIY installation videos. \nThe initiative involves an educational drive where students, acting as citizen scientists, gather and share data on bidet usage and delve into water issues in their region. This hands-on approach also includes field trips to local water facilities, providing them with a comprehensive understanding of bidet advantages. By partnering with water utilities and local governments, we envision a self-sustaining model, continually championing bidet use. \nAs this initiative grabs headlines, Nouns will stand out as the pioneering force behind it. Your support will be the kickstart we need!\n\n**Update** We’ve updated the proposal after listening to feedback and reduced the initial ask, explained our goal for a self-sustained program (no future nouns funding required), and highlighted how Nouns will be seen as the hero catalyzing this revolutionary change in bathroom culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How will it work?\n[![Screen Shot 2023-09-20 at 10.20.35 AM|690x388](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/original/1X/64fdc44ca71b4895023689cf724500b0b393e1b8.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o)\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o)\n\nOur  journey will start with our pilot program in South Texas which will be a pivotal step for data collection, refining strategies, and pinpointing best practices. We are delighted to have already gained the enthusiastic support and active engagement of local utilities and educators,  who will propel the growth of our community and our vision.\nThrough our ongoing community-building efforts, we will strive to gather a strong initial group of participants in South Texas, our pilot region. Far from being just beneficiaries, these participants will become pioneers, actively contributing to data collection and shaping a communal narrative through social media engagement. These authentic stories, personal experiences and testimonials,  will initiate a cultural shift towards bidet use and create a united front against water wastage.\nThe Nouns DAO can kickstart this effort, providing the initial push needed to get the ball rolling. But this isn't just a one-time splash; it's a tide of transformation! The real heart of this initiative is its ability to keep going on its own. Our goal is more than just handing out affordable bidets; it's about making a lasting change in how people use bathrooms in America.\nThis initiative will be a wave of change that keeps building and reaching farther. Our pilot program marks the first splash, but together, we have the power to reshape perspectives, enhance water sustainability, and fundamentally revolutionize water habits across the United States.\n\n**Want a Limited Edition Golden Nouns Bidet ⌐◨-◨?** \nDonate 0.05 ETH or more at  [https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592](https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592).\nAll contributions further our mission, and as a token of our appreciation, you'll receive the exclusive bidet.\n\n\n# Why Bidets?\nEnter the humble toilet-mounted bidet — a nifty contraption that adds a touch of luxury to your bathroom routine. It replaces or fits beneath the toilet seat and uses a a nozzle to spray water for cleansing. Its installation is easy and doesn't demand a plumbing professional. Many models even showcase features like adjustable pressure, temperature control, and self-cleaning. Beyond all that, however, lies an ecological marvel— a cost-effective solution that promotes better hygiene while reducing toilet paper waste.\n\nBidets have garnered worldwide recognition for their remarkable water-saving abilities and paper-reducing magic. Embracing bidets translates to preserving trees, conserving water, and reducing the energy dedicated to manufacturing and transporting toilet paper.\n\nTheir appeal isn't just environmental; it's also rooted in hygiene. Bidets offer hands-free, pristine cleanliness, an invaluable health advantage, especially in a time when global health awareness is at its peak.\n\nOur aging water infrastructure poses yet another challenge. Sewage systems of many cities groan under the weight of non-degradable items. These infrastructures were designed for a different era, and non-degradable products like wet wipes weren't part of the plan. Despite their convenience, wipes don't break down in water like toilet paper does. This leads to stubborn blockages, damages to equipment, and ultimately, significant repair costs that households and communities have to bear.\n\nBidets, however, offer a sustainable lifeboat. By adopting bidets, we curtail clogs and damages, sparing households and cities from hefty repair costs. It's not just a bathroom upgrade; it's a blueprint for economic resilience, environmental harmony, and public health.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Our Background\n[![Screen Shot 2023-09-20 at 10.20.35 AM|690x388](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/original/1X/4d1175bec0882ed790ebee5f64ef9998d4ab6125.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE)\n[Video of our Lil Nouns Water Purification Kits built in partnership with the Light House for the Blind Nonprofit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE)\n![79685689a8627fcb69f5c7a138529474869a119a_2_1034x748|690x499](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/optimized/1X/79685689a8627fcb69f5c7a138529474869a119a_2_1034x748.jpeg)\nLil Nouns Kits at our Black Girls Code Event in Houston. \n\n![|217x384](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/S_Kp1aNv2LHDB43Vd7I0bRW3nyPCIiP2lVjTWbgxXiDGTn70Y_I0Se93u0w_tHlnoWD1LzBKB4_w7iqBBz-8_Ogbj9kYiRXvt1rOCAVEyVv9r_UjpoFAu0OBOYZCEgScAS1bb44qldiFXtw4YtwVXWI)\n\n*View MakeWater Endaoment Donation History https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592\n* In June 2022, Lil Nouns passed our 3,000 nouns kits for students proposal by a resounding 211 to 4 vote (➡️see [here](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/16)).\n* We teamed up with Lighthouse for the Blind to create these kits, and we marked our partnership with a video (➡️watch it[ here](https://youtu.be/0thwr7QItyE)).\n* Our victory streak continued with a win at the FoodNouns Prop, where our proposal to create video vignette for our water education curriculum (click to watch our video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYrK_6Y_qUU), ➡️and check out our [tweet](https://twitter.com/makewaterorg/status/1659299148066177024?s=20)) garnered unanimous support (➡️see our %100 positive votes in [here](https://www.foodnouns.wtf/vote/3)).\n* We’ve also received a positive response Lil Nouns PropHouse (Open Round 12) for our proposal asking Lil Nouns to be a 3D printer prize sponsor for World Water Day youth competition (➡️see [here](https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-12-open/3649)).\n* Nounish Team also highlighted our work on World Water Day, with a reel showcasing our work and our ongoing partnership with the community (➡️see [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/4rzK2iCFoWA?feature=share)).\n* Beyond our cherished Nouns community, our network encompasses educators, water utilities, and beyond.

With contracts built by Wilson, Propdates is the best way to keep up with Nouns proposals after they pass, and an entirely new design space within the greater Nouns ecosystem. We’ve never had any consistent, onchain way to keep track of contributors’ work, and no way to recommend regular updates. Down the line, one could imagine Propdates as an onchain oracle for proposal progress.\n\n## PROGRESS SO FAR\nI built the Propdates site and public graph, inspired by Krel’s [requests.wtf](http://requests.wtf). What started as a weekend experiment has grown into something much bigger: it’s clear that we’ve tapped into something special. In fact, Propdates has already become part of the pre-proposal conversation process - it is expected that a proposer regularly updates the DAO on their work. In just a few weeks, we already have had 17 unique posters, and more coming.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/mt9nCgz/metrics.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/CzXyQrg/other.png)\n\n## LOOKING AHEAD\nWe’d like to move Propdates from an experiment to a fully-featured Nouns app and a key part of the ecosystem, on par with teams like Agora, Federation, Prop House. Our end goal is for Propdates to be a protocol any contract or app can plug into to determine a proposal’s success. It is clear that it could expand further than just Nouns.\n\nWe are asking for three months of funding (more on the team below). Martin will be close to full-time, but working on other projects as well (similar to almost all software proposers). We expect Onion to be part time for two months or so. For these months, our priorities will be:\n1.  Contract improvements to expand functionality  & data\n\t- New channels to post updates in: prop house entries, user channels, custom channels\n\t- Revamped admin system / permissions + “Super Admin” to unlock proposals where proposer is unresponsive\n\t- Explore contract to update/revoke streams based on a proposal's updates\n2.  Improved editor, claiming and submitting UX\n\t- Easy image upload via Arweave or IPFS (and potentially expand as a public good for Nouns ecosystem)\n\t- In-app markdown editor and previews for better UX\n3.  Farcaster integration for likes & comments on updates\n4.  Open Editions to celebrate Completed Props\n\nOur goals by January 31st, 2024 are:\n-   150 proposals marked as completed\n-   400 updates posted\n-   30 weekly updates on average\n\nAdditionally, we want to encourage past proposals to share updates on their work, but recognize it’s often hard for contributors to track down their sponsoring proposers (pre-v3). We are requesting 0.05 ETH to send to each of the first 100 successful props (before prop #363) that posts a non-trivial update as an incentive to kickstart the protocol. At the time of writing there have been 225 successful proposals, so this would go a long way to getting all proposals marked as completed.\n\n## TEAM\n\n-   [martin](https://twitter.com/anquetil) worked on [Mogu](http://nouns.wtf/vote/321), [Explorer Grants](http://nouns.wtf/vote/178), [Hack Week](http://nouns.wtf/vote/253)\n-   [onnnnnnnion](https://twitter.com/onnnnnnnion) (solidity) worked on [BLOCKS](https://mint.fun/zora/0x1F781d47cD59257D7AA1Bd7b2fbaB50D57AF8587), [onions renderer](https://twitter.com/onnnnnnnion/status/1639045062595170307), [PH Infinite Round Committee](https://prop.house/infinite/nouns-retro-grants)\n\n## FUNDING\n-   Team: 30 ETH for three months (via Stream)\n-   Incentives: 5 ETH (100 * 0.05 ETH)\n-   OpEx: 2 ETH\n \nWe commit to posting updates on [updates.wtf](https://updates.wtf) bi-weekly to keep the community updated on our progress.

Our new audience is highly engaged and consists primarily of artists, designers and other creative types from around the world.   Our goal in season 3 is to 10X our followers from 80K to 800K in 6 months with $969K in funding.\n\n----\n\n## Who are we\n\nWe are nounish, a team funded three times by Nouns DAO ([pilot](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/64), [season 1](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/143), & [season 2](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/289)). We started as a marketing studio for the DAO, producing dozens of videos about Nouns-funded projects, including the [11 minute explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa79nN4gMPs) on [nouns.wtf](https://nouns.wtf), as well as videos about [Gnars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQSmfSnRGVk), [Free Glasses for Kids](https://x.com/nounish/status/1601906808716566530?s=20), and most recently, [Mucho Love](https://twitter.com/nounish/status/1675846336909033472) & [Esports](https://twitter.com/nounsesports/status/1694196803015479399).\n\nWe are a team of 10 who transformed our commercial production company, [Pixel](https://pixel.melbourne), to focus full-time on Nouns, and we are based in Melbourne, Australia. We are led by [Goldy](https://twitter.com/Goldypix) & [142](https://twitter.com/noun142) –two Nouners, and early community members.\n\n----\n\n## Season 2: The Quest for PMF\n\nThe content we produced up to the beginning of season 2 was highly useful for explaining Nouns to the world and resonated well with Nouns enthusiasts and their networks on Crypto Twitter, and has been cited by Nouners, builders, and fans as their gateway into the ecosystem. But in season 2, responding to [feedback from our last proposal](https://www.voter.wtf/?proposalid=289&proposalId=289), we set out to find PMF and distribution beyond the existing Nouns community. We wanted our content to resonate with a clearly defined audience that was large enough to have a significant impact on Nouns.\n\nSo we developed a framework to test  hypotheses for different audiences and content, and in our recent [proposal update](https://www.updates.wtf/prop/289), we go into details on the different tests we ran.\n\n---\n\n## Finding PMF\nThree months into our testing, we created a hit with our new reality TV-style concept, \"3 Artists, 1 Noun.\" The show features a short and playful competition between three world-class artists to create a new piece of art inspired by the day’s noun within just five hours.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b46zY6k.jpg)\n\nThe show quickly became popular on Instagram, with the top episode receiving over 1 million organic views. We have released eight episodes so far, which have received over 2 million views and brought us over 70,000 new followers.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KhoDu0v.gif)\n\n\nOther signs of PMF include a very high engagement rate: our top episode got 140,000 likes (a 14% like/view ratio), and every episode receives hundreds of comments, saves, and shares.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SpVe7hi.gif)\n\n\n---\n\n## Our Audience\nThe audience that the show is attracting is consistently identifiable as what we call \"The Creatives.\" Our followers are designers, artists, creative directors, filmmakers, animators, illustrators, and so on. We also have attracted some well known brands in the creative sector, including [Wacom](https://www.instagram.com/wacom) and [Artlist](https://www.instagram.com/artlist.io).\n\nWe see this as a chance to build a community outside the crypto bubble that is a perfect fit for Nouns, a group of talented and inspired creative people.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/k2yxgRA.jpg)\n\n\n---\n\n## More Than Growth: A Relationship With Our Audience\n\nBy turning the camera back on ourselves we are making ourselves a tangible representation of the Nounish values they can relate to – joyous, welcoming, playful, creative, and collaborative.  \n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dPMAnxm.gif)\n\n\n\n\nAs we share our inspiring culture (one completely in line with Nouns' own values) our audience will grow to love the show and the people on it. And in the long term, as the connection between us and our audience deepens, we give ourselves the best chance to galvanise them to engage with Nouns in a more meaningful way.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UONjU3I.jpg)\n\n---\n\n\n## Season 3: 10X again\n\nIn season 3, our goal is to 10X our audience again from 80K to 800K followers in 6 months.\n\n**How will we achieve this?**\n\n* Double down on 3 Artists and keep on iterating to reach tens of millions of people\n* Develop new content that will resonate with our community\n* Experiment with new formats (e.g. length of show) to breakout on YouTube\n\n---\n\n## Longer term\n\nOver the next few years, we will reach tens of millions of people and build a massive followership via content that engages, entertains, inspires, and educates about Nouns. We think nounish can help build the distribution Nouns needs to reach mass market. We are fired up and excited to build this and to bring Nouns mainstream!\n\n---\n\n## Our Ask\nWe are asking the same budget from the past two seasons: $969,000 USD\nFor the same amount of time: 6 months.\n\n## Transactions\n* 30% up front ($290K USDC)\n* 70% streaming over 6 months from December 17, 2023 to June 17, 2024 ($679K USDC)"},{"blockNumber":18371195,"blockHash":"0xcccb199b3e7ba7f98985e5f28d65202da94ce51717cf44f087af5739c561b8da","transactionIndex":158,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xcb30ab2d8d35a67acfa776892aa15dcb07e6d47fe5edaa74dc3516c0d56032db","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":414,"proposer":"0xF952A0788137Cef8Cba0B315a042262Ddc12c3aF","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000001cd2f6a466e12136a9e0b691bf86b0ca5f7a70ec0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001176592e00"],"startBlock":18392795,"endBlock":18421595,"description":"# One Noun, Every Day, Forever... in an Action Rogue-Lite Game!\n\n# PROPOSAL\n![NounsTown Promo](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Ff8c8617c-3190-4fc4-8dcc-2b088b4fd397%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=4e47bfa8-37e1-4112-bde8-7b1e0b996a25&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\nPlay as ***One Noun, Every Day, Forever***, in an action rogue-lite game developed in collaboration with ***Nouns*** and ***Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult*** to be released on ***Steam/PC!***\n\n###### TL;DR\nWe are asking for ***$75,000*** ***to fund the first 3-months of production*** for our indie Nouns game.  Check out our playable demo here (use Safari for MacOS users):\n[NounsTown Demo](https://thepixelshop.itch.io/nounstown-demo)\n\n\n# PROLIFERATION\nOur proposal aims to proliferate Nouns by focusing on a ***specific target market of the PC gaming community*** that is interested in indie games, specifically ***the rogue-lite genre***.  A rogue-lite indie game provides a compelling opportunity for Nouns to enter the gaming sector due to the following reasons:\n\n##### Rising Popularity\n- Indie developers have had incredible success in recent years due to their ability to design ***innovating*** and ***creative*** new games that AAA studios often avoid\n- Developers have gained access to multiple ***mass distribution platforms*** such as Steam, Nintendo Switch, Itch.io, and Epic Games to reach a wide audience\n- Available resources and advancements in game development have provided a landscape for small teams, or even individual developers, to produce games with a ***powerful cultural impact and longevity***\n\n##### Lower Risk Entry to Gaming\n- We conceptualized the game design to ensure as much value and ***replay-ability*** while maintaining a ***reasonable scope*** of work and ***longer-term scalability***\n- Our proposal provides for a ***phased funding and development approach*** to ensure a ***transparent production*** process, opportunities to receive ***community feedback***, and provide multiple ***tiers of content***\n- We will use ***Steam as our distribution platform*** to launch the game; however, we will explore porting the game to Nintendo Switch after the initial launch and financial considerations\n\n##### The Charm of Pixel Art\n- Our art team collectively has over ***30 years of pixel art experience*** and will design a game aesthetic that will resonate with indie gamers and pixel art enthusiasts\n- Pixel art games have had tremendous success with nearly ***13,000 games available on Steam.***  Some household names including Stardew Valley, Shovel Knight, Celeste, Terraria, Hyper Light Drifter, Enter the Gungeon, Octopath Traveler, and Baba is You\n- Our game will showcase many different pixel art styles including our ***modern aesthetic gameplay, retro style UI and game map, and high resolution portraits***\n\n##### Creative Commons\n- All of the ***art and animations*** that we produce during development will be ***open-source*** and available to the community to use!\n- ***After development***, we will ***consider making the game open-source*** to collaborate with game developers and artists to contribute new content\n\n# GAME OVERVIEW\n##### Game Engine\nThe game will be developed using ***Godot 4***, a free and open-source game development engine!  \n\n##### Genre\n**Rogue-Lite**\nThe key feature of a Rogue-Lite genre is a game loop that results in ***permadeath***.  Each time a player begins their attempt or run, they will either defeat the final boss or die trying.  A Rogue-Lite game generally involves some ***permanent progression*** that takes place ***outside of the run***; usually in the form of upgraded weapons, statistics, abilities, or skill trees.\n\n**Bullet Hell**\nBullet Hell combat mechanics emphasize ***complex bullet patterns*** for the player to navigate and dodge.  Our bullet hell game will be designed as a twin stick shooter where the player is on a ***flat plane with a top-down perspective***.  They will then use one joystick to control the player and the other joystick to control the direction of shooting, or for the real ones, mouse for shooting and keyboard for movement!\n\n**Non-Linear Progression**\nOne of the unique selling points of our Rogue-Lite game is that it will have Non-Linear progression.  The two main features to highlight in this design include a ***unique map that is generated each run*** and the freedom for the player to ***decide their order of progression***.    Each location will have distinct characteristics that the Player may take advantage of depending on their weapon selection and upgrade composition.  \n\n**Inspiration**\n[Enter the Gungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/), [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/), [Risk of Rain 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/), [Nuclear Throne](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/Nuclear_Throne/), [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/)\n\n\n##### Story\nWelcome to the world of ***Nouns Town***, a charming community nestled amidst pixelesque landscapes.  The citizens of **********Nouns Town********** are visionaries that seek to build a spectacular new world as seen through a new type of lens, ***Noggles**!*  These Noggles may look like quirky little glasses, but they empower the wearer to harness the boundless energy within themselves.\n\nBut an ominous cloud is forming over Nouns Town.  The malignant ***Lich King*** has arrived with an ***army of shadowy minions*** to seize these *Noggles* and exploit their power to build their own evil empire.  Nouns Town desperately needs a hero to put an end to the invasion!\n\n##### Primary Game Mode: One Noun, Every Day, Forever\n- Play as a new Nouns character every rolling 24-hour period beginning with Noun #1 and all Nouns that follow\n- Every player will attempt the daily run with the same weapon, world map, upgrade choices, and enemy spawns\n- The map seed will change each day along with the playable character\n- Compete against all other players on the leaderboard for the fastest clear time\n- All daily winners will secure their place in the game’s history!\n\n![A Noun A Day Promo](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Febdf3ba8-dbc9-460f-8931-857889572ea5%2Fstage_nouns_v_souls.png?table=block&id=cbaa22ac-9c9d-4d42-856c-64c595492dde&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Traditional Game Mode: Protonoun\n**Play as the Protonoun in a traditional rogue-lite game mode**\n- Select your starting weapon and begin your run in a unique generative map\n- Gain Upgrades as you progress through each room of enemies\n- Search for two hidden keys to unlock each stage Boss\n- Encounter NPCs and Events as you explore the map\n- Complete achievements during your run to unlock new content\n- Defeat the final boss, the Lich King, to beat the game\n\n![The Protocave](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F91f59fde-3358-41dc-8a8a-14f1721c4141%2Fprotocave.png?table=block&id=dd19d7a6-e01a-4bd6-86b1-838af593bf3d&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Weapons\n\nThe player will begin each run by selecting a single weapon type.  As they progress through the game, their weapon gets upgraded to powerful new tiers.  New weapons are unlocked through an achievements system and provide diverse play styles and synergies, for example:\n\n- Sniper Rifles - Slow fire rate and reload rate, but high single target damage\n- Shotguns - high close range damage, but wide bullet spread at long range\n- Rocket and Grenade Launchers - significant area of effect damage, but slow reload speed and fire rate\n- Assault rifles - higher ammo capacity and fire rate, but less damage per bullet\n\n**Sample** **Weapons:**\n![Weapon Concepts](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F457fa7a0-a1a4-4ec4-ad5d-b0887aa853cb%2Fweapons.png?table=block&id=f4229042-9adf-4a99-9c0c-83b4fcdde425&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Upgrades\nAs the player clears each room,  they are rewarded a pair of Noggles to return to their rightful owner and gain a new weapon modifier.  Each upgrade is inspired by various characters from the Nouns collection.  Early concepts include:\n\n- Lightning Bolt Noun unlocks chain lightning\n- Basketball Noun unlocks bouncing bullets\n- Popsicle Noun unlocks frost bullets\n- Pencil Noun unlocks piercing bullets\n- Chipboard Noun unlocks spark aura\n- Baseball Noun unlocks curving bullets\n\nPlayer upgrades each have multiple tiers of strength.  Further, different combinations of upgrades will create fun synergies and provide a unique gameplay experience each run.  Unique and innovative upgrades will be explored during game development.\n\n![Upgrade Card Previews](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Feef9abba-1288-4e3d-9be3-02216f525651%2Fnouns_upgrades_promo.png?table=block&id=d9a79c15-bee4-42f8-ae7e-5b1a53e0d826&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Minions and Bosses\n\nMinions and Bosses will be based on the Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult: Forgotten Souls collection.  All minions will be designed to have a diverse range of attack styles and bullet patterns.  Early attack style concepts include melee, burst range, sniper range, summoners, and complex bullet patterns for elite minions.  \n\nWe will use rare NFTs from the Forgotten Souls collection as our Stage Bosses and the Lich King as our final boss.  Our first Boss engagement will be designed and implemented in Phase I of production.\n\n**Sample** **Minion Designs:**\n![Minion Concepts](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Fed2d7a9a-3f76-484b-9c3b-a8bef7f00f4a%2Fminions.png?table=block&id=c90faec9-9a19-40dc-9b9a-aeab46b202ab&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Map and Room Design\n\nWith the game’s setting taking place in Nouns Town, our protagonist will progress through the map to clear each location of the Forgotten Souls.  As mentioned in the Genre section above, our map and game loop will have a ***Non-Linear*** design.  The design will have the following characteristics:\n\n**Unique Generative Maps**\n\n- Each run will generate a new Nouns Town map seed with approximately 30 - 45 Locations, 2 Stage Boss chambers, and 1 Final Boss chamber\n- The Player will have the freedom to decide which locations to clear first\n\n**NPC and Event Rooms**\n\n- We will include friendly NPCs and locations to provide healing, potential upgrades, and/or narrative progression\n- Additionally, we are exploring various Event Rooms that occur random times throughout each run that provide new challenges for the player\n\n**Room Architecture**\n\n- We will design a large library of Locations and Rooms that the map generator will pull from to maintain a unique and diverse world for each play through\n- Room types within each location will have consistent thematic designs to provide new challenges and allow the player to associate location aesthetics to gameplay characteristics\n\n**Room Decorations**\n\n- We will produce a library of tile sets, decorations, barriers, and destructible objects to fill each room with a fun and unique personality inspired by Nouns\n- We will mix and match each room’s architecture to various aesthetics to give each room a unique personality and provide diversity between each run\n\n**Sample assets:**\n![Tile Set Preview](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F440c398d-3d22-4e10-93c7-1ed447b2e1ca%2Ftileset_sample.png?table=block&id=7419a6e2-cfd2-4208-9a47-5d3715964af5&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Sound Design\n\nFull sound design will include sound effects and an original soundtrack.

We seek Nouns DAO's support of 28.99 ETH to enhance this iconic event, held across 39,000 square metres, with the Nouns bringing the FUN and ENTERTAINMENT, ensuring a memorable experience for all attendees including:\n* 5,000 kids in need\n* 3,000 parents and carers\n* 600 corporate volunteers\n* 100 VIP guests\n\nThis year's party will be held in mid-December 2023.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SybKqjyga.jpg)\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Background:\nFor over three decades, the Variety Kids Xmas Party has been a beacon of hope for kids in need. Held at the Melbourne Convention Exhibition Centre, this event has touched the lives of over 165,000 children since its inception in 1986. The massive event is completely FREE for 5,000 children and 3,000 carers to attend, ensuring that each child receives a gift and experiences an inclusive day of fun, activities, stage entertainment, carnival rides, all-abilities sport and an all-important visit from Santa. For many, this celebration is the only one they have during the Christmas season, and the gifts they receive at the party are often the only ones they receive. The Variety Kids Xmas Party is a safe space for children living with disabilities or experiencing disadvantage or illness, allowing them to be themselves without fear of judgment from their peers. This remarkable event is made possible by the dedication and hard work of the small Variety team and over 600 volunteers.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkJSDa1xp.jpg)\n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Profound Impact:\nThe Variety Kids Xmas Party is more than just a day of fun; it&#39;s a lifeline for families who often feel isolated or overlooked. For many children, the event offers a rare opportunity to experience joy, laughter, and a sense of belonging. Parents often remark on the transformative effect of the party, noting the boost in their children's confidence and self-esteem. The ripple effect extends beyond the children to their families, providing them with a much-needed respite and the chance to see their children thrive in a supportive environment. The memories created during the party serve as a source of strength and inspiration for families throughout the year.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkJ5cjkxT.jpg)\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Testimonials:\n\"You have no idea what this means to us.

I will be forever thankful that Variety did that for me and my boys this Christmas.” Shelly, parent of Jaxon and Dylan.\n\nTo make the day even more special, each child receives a gift bag full of age-appropriate toys and games (including Nounish items) to take home and enjoy.

Held at the Melbourne Convention Exhibition Centre, this event has touched the lives of over 165,000 children since its inception in 1986. The massive event is completely FREE for 5,000 children and 3,000 carers to attend, ensuring that each child receives a gift and experiences an inclusive day of fun, activities, stage entertainment, carnival rides, all-abilities sport and an all-important visit from Santa. For many, this celebration is the only one they have during the Christmas season, and the gifts they receive at the party are often the only ones they receive. The Variety Kids Xmas Party is a safe space for children living with disabilities or experiencing disadvantage or illness, allowing them to be themselves without fear of judgment from their peers. This remarkable event is made possible by the dedication and hard work of the small Variety team and over 600 volunteers.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkJSDa1xp.jpg)\n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Profound Impact:\nThe Variety Kids Xmas Party is more than just a day of fun; it&#39;s a lifeline for families who often feel isolated or overlooked. For many children, the event offers a rare opportunity to experience joy, laughter, and a sense of belonging. Parents often remark on the transformative effect of the party, noting the boost in their children's confidence and self-esteem. The ripple effect extends beyond the children to their families, providing them with a much-needed respite and the chance to see their children thrive in a supportive environment. The memories created during the party serve as a source of strength and inspiration for families throughout the year.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkJ5cjkxT.jpg)\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Testimonials:\n\"You have no idea what this means to us.

Variety will be contributing the balance of event costs as outlined in our budget section funded by donors who contribute to our Christmas appeal and throughout the year.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryuBcikxp.jpg)\n\n\n**BUDGET**\n\n* Entertainment – all on-stage performers, Santa, dancers, character performers such as the Grinch and Real Dinosaurs, carnival rides including a ferris wheel, sideshow alley, Santa’s grotto, all-abilities sports activations, silent movie cinema, and main stage visual, LED screens, audio, staging, stage lighting & rigging $32,511 USDC\n* Photography/filming and package creation $3,219 USDC\n* Nouns Noggles - donated $0 USDC\n* LEGO - donated $0 USDC\n* Colouring sheets - printing $645 USDC\n* Free standing foam Noggles sculpture $645 USDC\n* Nouns signage x 25 $804 USDC\n* Nouns character costume $4,506 USDC\n* 600 Nouns branded tees worn by corporate volunteers across the venue $3,862 USDC\n* 2,000 temporary Noggles tattoos $1,287 USDC\n* TOTAL $47,479 USDC\n\nIn addition, Variety will be paying USD $128k (funded across the year by our donors) as follows\n* Catering extras (90% catering sponsor)\t$7,443\n* Event management and non-main stage venue AV, staging & rigging\t$31,900\n* Venue hire cost\t$15,400\n* Gift bag of toys for every child\t$64,169\n* Transport, freight, couriers and postage \t$2,951\n* Staffing, logistics, and marketing\t$6,416\n\t\n    \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1L_0i1x6.jpg)\n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ The Team\n**Georgie Smith - Variety Project Lead**\n[Georgie](https://https://twitter.com/RoxbySmith) has a twenty-five-year career in not-for-profit fundraising, marketing and event management and currently leads Variety – the Children’s Charity digital innovation program including crypto philanthropy.

These three artists in particular were very early builders in the nouns ecosystem, all were members of the first group of Nouncillors, and all have openly helped others in the ecosystem to help proliferate Nouns.\n\n**Prop Inspiration:** Important note - this idea came from me not Mr. Boney, Messhup or Sidenoun. As I was reflecting on my own nounish journey, these three kept popping up in my story, sometimes in obvious ways, other times just in the background, but always there. There are so many others who have also made strong contributions and should be recognized as well but this seemed like a great place to start.\n\nI reached out to all three and confirmed they would accept a Noun if given the opportunity and all agreed to hold it for a minimum of one year since we do not yet have a vesting contract in place. (Actually each one said they'd never sell when asked.)\n\nAs long time contributors to the ecosystem, I can think of no better future Nouners.\n\n### Mr. Boney\n\nLaunching just a couple months after Nouns on October 10, 2021, **[The Boneys](https://opensea.io/collection/theboneys)** combined Nouns and Cryptoadz to create a new spooky take on cc0 art. The collection has some well known holders, among them [**David Horvath**](https://x.com/davidzhorvath/status/1448014564159799307?s=20) (a Boney whale) and Luca Netz. \n\nIn addition to The Boneys, Mr. Boney also created [**The Boney Bats**](https://opensea.io/collection/the-boney-batz), [**UniToadz**](https://opensea.io/collection/unitoadz), [**$PepeToadz**](https://opensea.io/collection/pepetoadz) and has contributed advice and assistance on numerous other projects including the [**Yellow Collective**](https://x.com/theboneys/status/1711251203093626976?s=20).\n\n \nThe Boneys continues to captivate and provide a unique character in the Nouniverse, recognized all on its own as well as part of the Nouns ecosystem, even finding its way to the NFT mural in NYC, the first piece of nounish art to do so.\n \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyjYkq4Gp.png)\n\n\n\n---\n\n### Messhup\n\nAt the core of almost every iconic piece of nounish art is Messhup, including pieces such as the **[Meta Noun Square](https://opensea.io/collection/the-meta-square-a-special-open-edition-by-messhup)**, the [**Rose Parade open edition**,](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x628d8222f064e3a29a69814bd13974b0160e8538) and **[the Nouniversary](https://opensea.io/collection/nounniversary-01)**, and the incredible nounish sails for NFT.NYC. Whenever a banger art piece is needed, Messhup is tapped and always over-delivers.\n\nBeyond these amazing individual pieces of nounish art, [**Messhup**](https://opensea.io/Messhup/created) has launched multiple cc0 collections of his own including PeeperToadz, [**Meme Seizer**](https://opensea.io/collection/meme-seizer), and [**Serial Collectors**](https://opensea.io/collection/serialcollectors).\n  \nAlso an original member of Nouncil, Messhup created the **[Nouncil logo](https://nouncil.wtf/)** and supports nounish builders with his art, even recently dropping a piece out of the blue to honor the **[Boneversary](https://x.com/messhup/status/1712625204684333166?s=20)**.\n\n ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1cZNqNfp.png)\n\n \n\n---\n\n### Sidenoun\n\nOne of the first recipients of a small grant from Nouns, Sidenoun launched the **[SideNoun](https://opensea.io/collection/sdn)** NFT project at the end of 2021 – an art project of cute nouns with their shifty eyes and the tagline: isometric nouns, looking highly suspicious. **[I personally came in through the SideNoun door](https://https://paragraph.xyz/@nounishprof/sidenoun)**, where I first encountered David Horvath in the discord and he set me straight on nouns traits. Not without its bumps and learnings, the Sidenoun project continues to shine as a small grants success story. \n\nBeyond this project, Sidenoun was also part of the original Nouncil core team – **[Nouncillor #1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gxXEoxUhHbcRZVSIB3mVbmRp3lfv-clnevIMuqiY2Jo/edit#gid=0)**! -- and went on to develop **[BYN: Build Your Noun](https://byn.wtf/)**. In the early days, you could find him lending a helping hand in the Nouns discord. He also has been a contributor/advisor to many other nounish projects, including providing guidance, assistance and technical development for FloriNouns and Vessel Verse among others.\n\nSidenoun was also one of the projects highlighted by Bud Light leading up to the Nouns appearance in their Super Bowl commercial.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1-2H5VfT.png)\n\n\n\n---\n\nAlthough there are many such deserving nounsfolk, I believe these three  -- **[Mr. Boney](https://twitter.com/theboneys)**, **[Messhup](https://twitter.com/messhup)**, and **[Sidenoun](https://twitter.com/sidenoun)** -- capture the essence of cc0 proliferation and have helped attract many to the Nouns ecosystem through their original artistic efforts.\n\n\n---\n\n \n**Summary of transactions:**\n\nNoun 326 to MrBoney.eth: 0x22D8D269A083EAD12E8D7F8fb9AdD8A38B5F4134 \n\nNoun 81 to Messhup.eth: 0x0C66d954d9cb1ebDF4E37a000262323C83655e70 \n\nNoun 826 to Sidenoun.eth  0xdB7f66F3D53A6A0EC43a49C7B6713e1bd3bd1383"},{"blockNumber":18429894,"blockHash":"0x9cc1dbc4d9e0fbb163240c624d6ea23ea02d93e0bdc81dd0ac8be679c6770448","transactionIndex":134,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x236bc1550d044ee98b3c3e9a8dd05de6bcaab5622a29dc43b5a7b064591c7551","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":422,"proposer":"0xb0dd496FffFa300df1EFf42702066aCa81834404","targets":["0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03","0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03","0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d"],"signatures":["safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)","safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)","withdrawDAONounsFromEscrowIncreasingTotalSupply(uint256[],address)"],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef71000000000000000000000000d94f65a9bfa4fcb04ffbc0a64687667fcb28110e00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002df","0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef71000000000000000000000000d94f65a9bfa4fcb04ffbc0a64687667fcb28110e00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001c8","0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000040000000000000000000000000d94f65a9bfa4fcb04ffbc0a64687667fcb28110e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014e"],"startBlock":18451494,"endBlock":18480294,"description":"# Nouner Scout Rounds\n\n*tldr: \nExperiment with Prop House as a way to bring in long-term aligned players by running **three rounds** where the award is one Noun.*\n\n---\n\nPost-fork, the main goal for Nouns has been to create a stable environment where the auction attracts long-term aligned participants rather than arbitrageurs.

The rounds' focus would be to bring in exceptional people who have previously contributed something meaningful in their respective fields. **Taking inspiration from [Brian Armstrong](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1681439056323051529), the round would serve as an explicit invitation for accomplished and interesting individuals to help steward Nouns.** \n\n\n**Round parameters:**\n- A two-week period for submitting proposals.\n- A one-week period for voting.\n- Open submission for all (with basic criteria to avoid spam).\n- Voting conducted by Nouns voters.\n- The proposer with the highest votes receives one Noun.\n\n**Logistics:**\nThe nouns would be escrowed in a [2/3 safe](0xDBDD666BFa569F72866Fba319271aC008B6bbe7a) managed by trusted community members [ccarella](https://twitter.com/ccarella), [necfas](https://twitter.com/necfas) and [seneca](https://twitter.com/cryptoseneca). \n\n**Timeline:**\nIf we stick to a ~20 day timeline, we can run three rounds between November and December with the final round ending on new years day :)\n\n**The Chosen Ones:**\nArmy Pickel, Icy Snowman, Fiery Cloud\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/CjYhViX.png)\n\n---\n\nIf the experiment is successful in attracting worthy participants, we could consider running continuous rounds to help allocate the 500+ Nouns in the treasury.

Distribution will be digital and physical, with plans for translation in 4 Languages. The project development will be shared through videos, live streams, and Open Editions, aiming for completion in 10-12 months.\n\n---\n\n## **A Graphic Novel (Vol 1)**.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkNjEYyzT.png)\n*Draft Cover/Poster*\n\nI’m targeting Graphic Novel readers (15+) who love both sci-fi and fantasy + adventure, usually read action-packed stories, but also love tech, and (included but not limited) are crypto users. The artwork will include concepts related to decentralization, blockchain, and internet technologies, and Nouns will be the characters that inhabit this universe.\n\nI firmly believe that we can find the right audience in Web3 at first, it’s an amazing niche to build a tech-oriented story and ultimately an onchain mythology, in which Nouns could be not only at the core of it but represent great values and a positive-sum culture.\n\nTo me, nouns are not only pixel characters, but something more, they are storytelling vehicles full of potential. And at the same time, there are dozens of small elements in our community lore to include in the story. \n\n---\n\n## **Evolution of the Nouns aesthetics (from my POV):**\nWe all love the original Nouns, they are perfect as the source material, but they are also really adaptable to using them in different styles.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyPczHAWa.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ-R9gHga.png)\n*The last two images are from April-June 2022.*\n\n In this world-building adventure, I've given the term \"Noun\" a fresh perspective, digging into its meaning both on the surface and at a deeper, symbolic level. This project isn't just about testing how Nouns look; it's also about spinning an engaging tale. We want to hook current Noun fans and introduce new readers to our world, even if they're not blockchain or DAO experts.\n \n---\n\n## **Distribution:**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJE-Pclfa.png)\nDraft Cover.\n\n**Digital First:**\nThe main distribution strategy will be online (Free download from the website, manga/comic reader apps like Comixology, Viz Media, Kindle, and P2P/torrents).\nMost of the dedicated comic reader apps have more than 500K users minimum, but in the case of bigger apps like Comixology or Viz Media, they have millions of users combined in both the App Store and Google Store.\n\n**Physical:**\nPhysical copies will be handled through Amazon (highly efficient, global coverage, and no upfront costs). Plus, in case we can make a deal with regional publishers, it's easy to shut down the distribution of a translated version directly on Amazon.\n\n\n**4 Languages:**\nEnglish, Spanish, Japanese, and French. \n\nI cannot emphasize enough the significance of translating the graphic novel. Translating the artwork can create opportunities for publication by one or multiple publishers in Europe, Asia, or North America. Since many major publishers prefer to review a complete work, and this being the first volume, it could serve as an ideal means to engage regional publishers worldwide.\n\n\n---\n\n## **Concept Art:**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJoFWSRZT.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJYtXrR-a.png)\n\n---\n## **Summary of the story (subject to changes):**\n\n\nMeet Shady, a Noun who doesn't quite fit the mold of an obedient or exemplary citizen in a world teeming with adventurers, mysteries, and high achievers. His existence is a quiet rebellion in a society that prizes conformity. However, it seems destiny, if it exists, has grander designs for Shady. His insatiable curiosity catapults him into the uncharted territories of unexplored worlds.\n\nAs Shady embarks on this enigmatic journey, it becomes clear that more than just his life is at stake. The fate of his entire kind rests on his shoulders, and time is of the essence.

This way people can follow more closely the development of the graphic novel and can ask questions about nouns and their ecosystem.\n\nThe goal is to make 2 videos per week (1 to 2 hours each) showing the process of the Graphic Novel, the idea is to use Twitch or YouTube (ideally both).\nI can also use propdates.wtf to show the latest news of the prop and the Manga channel in Farcaster.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyO0trwWa.png)\n*This is a sample of how the videos could look like*.\n\n## Key Milestones:\n\n**Concept and Team (Months 1-3):**\nDevelop the storyline and artistic style.\nAssemble and prepare the creative team.\n\n**Production and Marketing (Months 4-10):**\nCreate the 64-page graphic novel while translating it into multiple languages.\nImplement marketing and promotion strategies on online platforms.\n\n**Distribution and Launch (Month 11-12):**\nPlan and execute the distribution strategy for both digital and physical copies.\nOfficially launch the graphic novel, including online and potentially in-person events.\n\n**Audience Engagement and Public Building (Ongoing):**\nContinuously engage with the community on various platforms.\nAdapt the project based on audience feedback and reception.\n\n**Global Expansion and Future Planning (Ongoing):**\nStart the conversations with external publishers to get the graphic novel.\nEvaluate the project's performance and plan for the next chapters.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByWvFmvG6.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Scope and Budget**:\nSince this is a graphic novel of 64 pages I will need around 10 to 12 months to finish it.\nThe ideal deadline would be the next Nouniversary and I’ll push myself and the team involved to do so, but I’m organizing the dates including all the team efforts and the standard timeframes to make the deadline more realistic so it could be released in October/November next year.\n\n---\n\n## **Budget Breakdown:**\n\n- **Preproduction -

We are often competing against traditional studio contracts for senior talent.\n  \n- Funding 3 episodes upfront will enable us to introduce batching of tasks for pre-production and animation, making the process much more predictable to manage. \n\n\n- More funding committed for the film will enable us to pre-empt discussions with distribution partners who will have a clearer picture of financing on the project and high likelihood of it being fully completed once they commit.\n\n---\n#### Where will the funds go to?\n- **Story and Scripting** for the Episode 3, 4 & 5 \n- **Preview Work in Progress and BTS** delivered through out the proposal duration\n- **Finished Episode 3,4 & 5** - delivered by 240 days time period.\n- Propdates published all along the way.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r19IfQTw3.png)\n\n\nAs we continue production, the timeline becomes more efficient and shrinks, ultimately leading us to the film conclusion. \n\n#### Kickoff Notes for EP3 onwards\n- After Episode 2 release, the team will be on a short hiatus for the rest of November (2 weeks).\n- Team ramps back up slowly throughout month of December and sporadic availability due to holiday month.\n- Expected to fully iron out EP3 script during this time period.\n- Team back at full capacity starting January and full production loop resumes. \n---\n\n### Recap and Progress Updates so far\nYou can follow Ep2 Propdates [here](https://www.updates.wtf/prop/317). \n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/2/2415348f7943c8a429024b648b3eb68b24a0d7fa_2_1380x862.jpeg)\n\n**Tl;dr:** Its bolder, bigger and better! \n\n\n#### Cast Announcements so far\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1zVh9NsW/19.png)\n\n- [Elijah Fox](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1701347725407838288) (Voice of Gi)\n- [Lisa Stanley](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1656100844763496448) (Voice of Mrs Waxman)\n- [Ray Hurd](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1710009700341928121) (Voice of Go)\n- [Cesar Romero](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1711863323967578591) (Voice of Leader blunt)\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/253cSV1K/environment-factory-hallyway.png)\n#### Behind the Scenes\n- [Discourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E_7XtzU47c&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation) with the directors : How Nouns Movie enabled them to do something unthinkable, completely remotely.\n- Understanding the intricacies of Blus [Musical Score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4OavIimoXs&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation).\n- Fun Trivia about the world [sound design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7umbTCiMTmk&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation) with Jordan - our SFX Lead.\n\n#### First Casting call\n- Casting call complete. 15 characters from other Nouns-values aligned communities were selected to make cameo appearances through out the Episode 2.\nhttps://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1686797509765840896\n- We intend to do more of these along to way opening the world of Blus outwards for others to participate in.\n\n#### Team Expansion Announcements\n- Dan Waters\nhttps://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1693785090340643078\n\n\n### DApp / UI Updates\n- **Nouns.Movie** was created to publish the story (dedicated webapp built with minting UX on top of Zora & cumulative leaderboard built-in)\n- Added Multi-episode support. \n- Introduced Worldview mints: Inexpensive art mints from different locations from the world of Blus that adds to cumulative ranking on the leaderboard.\n- Dedicated Behind the scenes section for audience to watch and explore auxillary content.\n- Planned token-gating for streaming content.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1Xd6YyB7/11111.png)\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/fTsHzvSg/2222.png)\n\n---\n\n### Story Updates\n**Genre**: Action, Comedy\n\nScript for the delivered Episode 2 can be found [***here***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gdInCNXaLvKA5Vrxe6aCTiOtE67jNpG6/view?usp=sharing)\n\n*We also created a rough outline of how the story progresses through completion.

His accolades include several design awards and publications in the watch industry.\n\nThe brand is committed to craft distinctive timepieces that stands out with innovative designs and groundbreaking features, including the use of pioneering materials and early adoption of web3 technology such as cryptocurrency, NFTs and metaverse experiences in the watch space.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p8gK5Fi.png)\n\n![](https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1694722112/t9ce7v5l3t52g3azgydp.png)\n\n![](https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1694722042/xhyf0mdtyqkfiip0plmr.jpg)\n\n\n## Contemporary distribution methods\n\nDWISS also excels in modern distribution methods. Leveraging the power of crowdfunding and Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) strategies, launching multiple campaigns and mastering influencer and digital advertising. These accomplishments attest to DWISS's strong marketing and sales capabilities, setting a **solid foundation for the success of our Go-to-Market strategy for NounsWatch**.\n\nCrowdfunding campaigns that generated more than USD $1.5 million.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/U5gHT6Y.png)\n\nDwiss have a portfolio of influencers that have millions of followers especially in Youtube, but also instagram, facebook, blogs and magazines.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JS08Qcu.png)\n\nDwiss masters Digital Advertising, generating 9.4 millions of impressions, and 109k clicks in 2023 alone.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f3G84AV.png)\n\n---\n\n# A unparalleled opportunity to reach a new audience\n\nWe meticulously planned a winning Go-to-Market Strategy to make the most of it with optimal resources. **The NounsWatch collection seizes an unparalleled opportunity of introducing Nouns to a whole new audience.** \n\n## Step 0: Entering the Affordable Fashion Market\n\nIn an industry that generated over $70 billion in 2022, fashion ranks as the second most significant reason people wear watches, trailing only behind timekeeping. This largely accounts for why the fashion watch segment records the highest annual unit sales in the tens of millions. **The NounsWatch collection pricing and style aims to secure a position in the largest portion of this growing segment: the sub-$200 fashion watch market.**\n\nThat said, time to sell.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DprKVhF.png)\n\n## Step 1: A pre-sale shortcut to meet 10 Million customers on Indiegogo\n\nA common challenge to IRL products is meeting the minimum order quantities (MOQ) whilst ensuring enough demand for the product. And for custom designed watches, the MOQ of 1000 pieces makes the equation a bit challenging. \n\nThanks to Dwiss successful track record on Indiegogo campaigns we can have a reputable access to create a Drop.\n\nAn Indiegogo Drop is an exclusive offer for qualified business that serves a discount pre-sale channel without the need for the regular crowdfunding. The highlight is the added layer of marketing to reach the fullest of Indiegogo’s 10 million monthly visitors and 1 million combined social media followers from 235 countries.\n\nDwiss will launch a NounsWatch Drop pre-sale for the price of ~~$189.00~~ $129.00 with [teaser videos and images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7ZsbPHqzFw) that will feature Nouns on the homepage of the Indiegogo website, as well as in related content such as carousels, newsletters, and social media.\n\n**By doing so, we aim to generate sufficient demand for NounsWatch, particularly from outside the Nouns and watchmaking communities, thus bringing it closer to mainstream media and markets.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/exRMxAh.png)\n\n## Step 2: Continuous sale on the NounsWatch Shopify store\n\nAfter the presale window concludes, sales will resume in our website [nounswatch.com](http://nounswatch.com/) for $189.00 ($169.00 for selected communities), where we will accept both fiat currency and cryptocurrency. Leveraging the same proven digital marketing strategy that Dwiss employs for its products, we are going to use a share of the sales profit in Digital Advertising to generate millions of impressions and drive hundreds of thousands of clicks to our website, until the point of delivery and after. If demand falls short, Dwiss name is in play. We bear the risk and will undertake the responsibility of selling the product.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jIsZVSV.jpg)\n\n## Step 3: Ding-dong! Delivery Time\n\nUpon receiving the initial shipment from the factory, we'll start fulfilling orders through both Indiegogo and Shopify channels. At the same time, we'll ramp up our marketing efforts to stimulate new demand, focusing on a broad [influencer campaign and a user-generated content initiative](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5h5gh3ZqPzjm_Rrt6FKdrTbbJ00IF9Es). **This is a pivotal moment for the NounsWatch and Nouns history, and we are committed to maximizing its impact.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wztkALV.png)\n\n## Step 4: The NounsWatch Legacy\n\n**Spin the Flywheel (new!)**\nRegardless the supply, **10% of every NounsWatch collection sales revenue will be sent back to the Treasury** and submitted to Propdates. Assuming a pre-sale sold-out of 1000 pieces, the gross revenue would be $129,000. 10% of this ($12,900) goes back to the DAO treasury, further reducing the actual costs to the DAO. Sales out of the pre-sale window generate more revenue.\n\n**Release the IP (new!)**\nThe NounsWatch blueprint and 3d files **will be cc0, fully available on the public domain**.\n\n**Everyday, forever (new!)**\nThe objective for NounsWatch is not to exist as a limited edition, but rather to establish it as a standard product in the Dwiss partnership lineup. **We will sustain production for as long as consumer demand remains**, and may release new straps, models, and features when deemed appropriate.\n\n**Warranty and Customer Support**\nDwiss will provide a world-class ongoing support and warranty for customers after 2 years they have purchased NounsWatch.\n\n---\n\n## **Funds Allocation**\n\nWe have meticulously planned the budget to ensure optimal allocation of funds across all critical aspects of the project. Our financial strategy for V2 has been redesigned to sustain our competitive pricing strategy while accommodating the increased workload of the team until the sales take-off. \n\nWe have estimated the financial requirements for the NounsWatch project as follows:\n\n- $5,000 - Development\n- $90,000 - NounsWatch and straps (1,000 pieces)\n- $10,000 - Packaging\n- $25,000 - External Labor and Taxes\n- $14,000 - First-Class Video and 3D Production (third-party services)\n- $7,000 - Indiegogo Drop Paid Feature Package\n- $18,000 - Team Compensation\n\n**TOTAL ASK: $169,000 USDC**\nWallet: [dwiss.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x80b0b325D6A1E19953dFffb6Cc117263916796F8)\n\n## Timeline\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UK7lhJP.png)\n\n---\n\n## Team\n\n[Fabio Seva](https://x.com/fabioseva) - Concept & Marketing\nLilNoun#125, nouns-pilled founder of [Public Good Beer](https://twitter.com/publicgoodbeer?s=21&t=OnA_W289RIsplarDuhpSrg)\n[Rafael Miranda](https://x.com/rsmiranda) - Design\nLilNoun#7753, watch designer and Dwiss founder\n[Dwiss](https://x.com/dwisswatch) - Production and operations\n\n---\n\n**Acknowledgments:** we would like to thank the dozens of comments we received during V1, which enabled us to develop this new version.

Looking forward to your thoughts!\n\n---\n\n*“Is Nouns activity growing?” “Who is helping increase engagement and spreading the meme?” “Which proposals are driving growth?” “What’s our spend rate?” “How many builders are contributing to the Nouns ecosystem?” “Are the amount of proposal candidates increasing?”*\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\nWe aim to create a single-purpose website where Nouns activity metrics are published. It will integrate activity across social channels and highlight which Nouns, advocates, and proposals have best supported the Noun’s meme propagation. Our creative motto is: *Track Memes, Not People.*\n\nAs a starting point, this proposal focuses on [1] onchain activity (supported by the Nouns subgraph), [2] two sources of social media (Farcaster and Instagram), and [3] a limited set of metrics — such as proposal submissions, votes, comments, posts, and engagement. Opportunistically, we will incorporate additional sources and expand the set of metrics.\n\n## Background\n\nAs of the moment, the Nouns’ community and audience members produce a wide variety of data. Over time, more data is likely to migrate onchain (e.g. similar to vote comments today) and data will be produced across even more digital localities. The *United World of Nouns* will have a wide-ranging data footprint. Combining data across these localities can become a powerful tool for proposal development and decision-making.\n\nHowever, as @Krel mentioned in their [Request for Proposers](https://www.notion.so/Nouns-DAO-Request-for-Proposers-94dadff999ac493b9902aa002e4b296e?pvs=21):\n\n> *“Nouns DAO does not have a reliable way to measure ‘growth’ or ‘success’. Its not clear what should be measured, or what growth in the context of Nouns even means.”*\n> \n\nThis project will create an initial repository of activity growth combining onchain and offchain data. We are long overdue to experiment on this front!\n\n## Scope\n\nThe metrics tracker will be in the form of a single-purpose web application.\n\nTo begin, we will include onchain data available in the Nouns Subgraph and two social media channels: Farcaster and Instagram. We will publish a selection of core metrics that provide clarity to Noun holders and the wider community.\n\nMost importantly, the underlying data pool (Meme Activity Database) will serve a first step towards a data-driven Nouns culture, which community members and potential builders can use to find opportunities for proposal submissions.\n\nSuccess of this project will be measured based on web application usage (unique visitors), proposal references (e.g. This project will increase X metric supporting Noun activity growth), and data pool connections (e.g. external usage of the Meme Activity Database).\n\nAs a stretch goal, we will look to expand the data sources, for example including key derivative NFT projects (Gnars, LilNouns, cc0-lib) and other dominant social spaces (Discord, Discourse, X, Lens, etc).\n\n*Note: X (formerly Twitter) has been deprioritized due to its cost ($5k per month) until initiative is proven useful. It would be included in future proposals.*\n\n*Note: Discord has been deprioritized due to its fragmentation (there multiple Nouns servers) until initiative is proven useful. It would be included in future proposals.*\n\n## Product Components\n\n### \n\nWhenever we want to test our internet speed, we can easily go to a speed test website. If we want to see how our activity on X (formerly Twitter), we can go to profile analytics. \n\n**Where do we go to check how the Nouns ecosystem is growing?** We go to *.*\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByD5JEHfp.png)\n\nThe Pulse is a single purpose website showcasing onchain and offchain activity metrics. This includes public conversations related to the **********************United World of Nouns.********************** The main graph, which we are currently calling *“Activity Momentum”* will showcase daily activity growth, a proxy for the Noun meme adoption and mind-share online.\n\nOur data analytics approach will combine methodologies from (1) traditional media broadcasting (e.g. combining data like number of views, replies, likes, proposal submissions, unique voters, etc.), (2) crypto-native metrics common across DAOs, and (3) materials science and engineering (read more about how engineers develop [material selection indexes here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_selection)).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJSJgVrGp.png)\n\nData will be synchronized in real-time directly from the Nouns’ Subgraph, Farcaster, Instagram to an SQL database. The sync mechanism will be architected in a uniform adapter interface for easier future integration with other onchain data and offchain sources, such as Twitter, Discourse, Discord, Telegram, DeSo, and Lens.\n\n**Example Onchain Metrics:**\n\n- Treasury\n- Treasury Usage Rate (Monthly Spend)\n- Burn Value\n- Candidate Props Growth\n- Proposal Submissions Growth\n- Active Proposals\n- Percent of Proposals Funded\n- Total Unique Builders\n- Average Auction Price\n\n**Example Offchain Metrics:**\n\n- Number of Posts\n- Total Engagement (Likes+Comments+Shares)\n- Engagement Rate (Ratio of Engagement to Posts)\n- Most Engaged Content\n- Total Followers\n- Follower Growth Rate (Updated based on API opportunity)\n- Noggles Score: Count of posts using “⌐◨-◨” on Farcaster*\n\n**In the first phase it won’t be possible to index Instagram posts by content, only be hashtags. As a result, the Noggles Score won’t be able to include Instagram posts.*\n\n### Meme Activity Database (a.k.a. The MAD)\n\nCurcially, the product’s underlying data model will be available for others to query and contribute to. That way, others can embed the index into their own Noun interfaces. Anyone should be able to get clean and reliable **meme-data-as-a-service** to support a diversity of Noun initiatives. Imagine a world where active proposals have conversation hype trackers, or ongoing projects can easily see total impressions across social media channels.\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to facilitate the use of data across the Nouns ecosystem. As the cc0 library enables media usage, the activity database enables tracking and impact analysis.\n\nThe Web API interface will be available publicly in the form of parametrizable JSON endpoints. The data will be distributed per specific sources (onchain Nouns, Farcaster, and others) as well as in aggregated form to enable the development of tools such as alerts, bots, and analytics dashboards.\n\n## Product Roadmap\n\nThe execution of this project will be done in an iterative fashion. By building in public and getting ongoing feedback, we can deliver what the community needs, and data that will support Nouns decisions.\n\n**Iterative Phases:**\n\n- **Phase 1:** Deliver basic UI w/ limited branding and processed Farcaster data displayed in form of metrics. Deliver mock-up UI for onchain metrics and Instagram metrics. Host open Q&A with Nouns (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 2:** Deliver basic UI w/ Farcaster metric feedback, plus Noun Subgraph indexing and onchain metrics. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 3:** Deliver basic UI w/ Farcaster, Onchain metric feedback, and Instagram metrics for specific accounts and hashtags. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 4:** Complete UI polishing and metrics calibration. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to celebrate launch and discuss future opportunities (where next).\n\n## An Ambitious Vision\n\nThis project aims to uncover what “Nouns-Native” analytics could look like, and what data infrastructure is necessary to feed this analytics into the broader Nouns governance and participation process.\n\nWe’ve already intuited that we want to ***Track*** ***Memes, Not People*** — and we’re certain there will be other innovations along the way. After all, we need to address challenges in crossing the web3-to-web2 data pipeline chasm. Is it possible? We think so.\n\nNouns is a place for ambitious ideas, and we are an ambitious team.\n\n## Team\n\nThis project will be led and executed by Rafa Fernandez (Farcaster: @rafa) and Rafi Gutkowski (Farcaster: @rafi). \n\n- Rafa Fernandez is a community architect with a focus on building [Digital Public Utilities](https://www.notion.so/General-Networks-e4615b9b52294f8bab34a82b47023d11?pvs=21). He has decade of experience in corporate analytics and studied materials-science and engineering. He is the founder of Folklore (Folklore.Institute), a community that curates and commissions research on digital cultures. Most recently, he was part of the Summer of Protocols research program looking at [online swarms](https://www.notion.so/Welcome-to-the-Swarm-41c114211ac045f087c44c16bd993748?pvs=21). Previous to the program he worked at Mirror where he worked in creator partnerships and community development.\n- Rafi Gutkowski is a software engineer and data scientist ([libred.org](https://libred.org/), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/rgutkowski)). He started mining bitcoin in 2015 but only after exiting from his recent startup, did he double down on web3. Since then Rafi has been working on sementic analysis of decentralized social graphs, as well as creating web3-web2 bridges, such as Folklore’s web3-signature to feed [broadcast applet](https://www.notion.so/Folklore-5d34757913064064b87119c4593eda74?pvs=21).\n\n## Funding\n\nWe are a stream of 22.5 ETH to fund this project over approximately 10 weeks.\n\nThe funds will be allocated to a two-person team (Rafa and Rafi). They are split roughly 25-75 between planning and iterative engineering. There is about a 40-40-10 between data engineering, visuals and handoff. There is approximately 10% reserved for bugs and issue resolution.\n\nWe expect that once the initial traunch of data engineering and visuals is complete, then we can make a decision on what the community needs more of (if anything), such as expanded data, or expanded analysis\n\n## Our Commitments\n\n- We commit to posting updates on [updates.wtf](https://updates.wtf/) with sprint plan and outcomes, in alignment with each of the community Q&A feedback sessions.\n- We commit to cancelling the stream based on community feedback.\n- We commit to executing this work as an open-source project, such that other onchain communities and organizations can benefit.\n\n## Other Notes\n\nThis proposal was built based on the Basic Nouns Proposal Template, built by Rafa and available here: https://hackmd.io/@rafathebuilder/BkPAmHZbp\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about this proposal, the first Q&A conversation on Aburra is available here: https://youtu.be/_dr2yZulMG"},{"blockNumber":18471858,"blockHash":"0x1acff2dda573f53233d67cbfcd34c04ed00ece22bd668aa6ad5ec30195db56bf","transactionIndex":102,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x5784e12b30813a73247bba0074de3aa8c33eb99ee0141927ed45eaa6be197446","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":428,"proposer":"0x2666f0C8FB58d182f2Dd79475DCA4A07B3724607","targets":["0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03"],"signatures":["safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef71000000000000000000000000e3f27deff96fe178e87559f36cbf868b9e75967d00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b5"],"startBlock":18493458,"endBlock":18522258,"description":"# Gift Noun 181 to Sasquatch\n\n## The Legend of Esports\n\nSasquatch founded Nouns Esports 1.5 years ago, swiftly establishing it as one of the premier esports organizations globally.

Moreover, we will also be promoting “Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨.”\n\n## Background & Challenges\n- While individuals possess various facets, society often fails to accept them, because it's easier to manage by measuring everyone against a uniform set of values, leading to a tendency to avoid complexity.\nI believe that the biggest societal issue lies in the attempt to oversimplify intricate matters. Many people in today's society are bound by existing frameworks, having forgotten how to create new concepts and systems on their own accord.\n\n- The utilization of web3 technology for societal transformation is in an trial phase, but leveraging Nouns' autonomous decentralized system has the potential to assist.\nThere's a need for support towards technology that encourages “pluralistic” decision-making and collaboration, as well as the activities that accompany it.\n\n- In October 2022, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities pointed out that Japan's education for persons with disabilities is lagging behind and made [recommendations.](https://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=6QkG1d%2FPPRiCAqhKb7yhsox6sZe%2Fik6d3iDJzISRPhvIaActFR9I%2FAIZ%2Be8dEYc3x9pGI%2BAqnUjiYnhf%2BzLRJLqW2mBzZdcaW0%2B10tvwrA97qOnmCuV89Qwl7dhkmc1B) However, there has been still no progress in understanding and awareness of disabilities, and the separation of special needs education from regular classes has been seen as a problem.\nFurthermore, research and studies on rare and congenital diseases are struggling due to the influence of market principles and an emphasis on efficiency.\n\n- “Bright Any Colors” is aimed at supporting individuals with disabilities, children, and students. Participants will be able to exchange opinions within the event, increasing the potential for new ideas and solutions to emerge.\n\n## Theme & Objectives\n“Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨” aims to enjoyably learn about DAOs through Nouns, aspiring to pave the way for a future where everyone shines their brightest. Our passion for enhancing the lives of all resonates with the public, and we've designed this event hoping that the concepts and systems of web3 naturally gain broader recognition. Relying on the insights and experiences from this endeavor, we will continuously engage in activities that leverage web3 technology to address societal challenges. We will host events 3-4 times a year, striving for widespread awareness and education.\n\n## Event Overview\n### Dec 23, 2023 Event & Workshop\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/2.png)\n\n- **A talk session will be held on the stage of the gymnasium.**\nOur special guests for this event will be Ms. Chizuru Azuma, an actor who has been actively involved in social contribution activities for over 30 years, and Mr. paji, a research expert in DAO and Co-Planner at pNouns.\nThe theme will be an explanation of the full-fledged DAO \"Nouns\" and its applicability to social issues.\n　\nFor example…the funding mechanism by Nouns DAO What is \"Treasury Wallet\"?\nWe'll introduce its structure, potential applications, and other real-life examples, all tailored for beginners.\nNouns-related images and videos will be projected using a projector into the visual stage production.\n\n- **Booth exhibition by social contribution organizations.**\nWe will introduce initiatives by organizations supporting people with disabilities, children, and students, as well as employment support facilities, as well as sell products and conduct educational activities.\n\n- **Invited event company \"NFT COLOR\" together the actively active web3 community in Japan Exhibiting NFT art works,** introducing the community, and interacting with social contribution organizations.\n\n### Event Proposal\n#### Various Workshops\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/3.png)\n\nMs. Chizuru Azuma is in charge of the planning, composition, casting, direction, costume design, and overall supervision of the [“MAZEKOZE Island Tour,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waK22pnvFRY) which is being streamed worldwide as one of the events of the “Tokyo 2020 NIPPON Festival.”\n\n[Using the theatrical arts to create a more diverse society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waK22pnvFRY) | Chizuru Azuma | TEDxKyoto\n\n### Location\n#### Nagono Campus\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/4.png)\n[\"Nagono Campus\"](https://nagono-campus.jp/englishguide/) is located in Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture.\n\n### Phase\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/5.png)\n\n### Advatages of simultaneous event in Tokyo and Nagoya\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/6.png)\n\nAt the event \"Noggles Jack Tokyo\" held on May 20th and 21st, 2023, Nouns became widely known to the general public through Noggles.\nAt the charity event \"Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨,\" we will set up a \"Noggles Jack Nagoya\" booth.\nJust like last time, attendees can enjoy Nouns characters and Noggles.

Once minted, 90% of the profits of the OE are distributed to the artists proportional to the number of pixels they painted. 10% goes to the protocol.\n\n--- \n\n*A big thank you to [solimander](https://x.com/_solimander_), [backseats](https://x.com/backseats_eth) and [wilson](https://x.com/wilsoncusack) who helped put the tx together*"},{"blockNumber":18521260,"blockHash":"0x21daffceae535d17783b5c88a12884da47c93cc648b9b11e28d737e2d64b83d5","transactionIndex":81,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x31b0f78350b647d178b0fc361904cc1fb237e2efcfb4e51bbd5ea54ba818b032","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":432,"proposer":"0x8e6aB6D4F70cc6E00a61498A427DF5e9407dDf0e","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000008e6ab6d4f70cc6e00a61498a427df5e9407ddf0e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ba43b7400"],"startBlock":18542860,"endBlock":18571660,"description":"# One Noun 3D Animation, Every Day ⌐◨-◨ (Revised)  \n\n# \n\n\n**This is a  revised version of [Candidate: 2 YEARS OF EVERYDAY 3D ANIMATIONS ⌐◨-◨](https://www.nouns.camp/candidates/0x8e6ab6d4f70cc6e00a61498a427df5e9407ddf0e-2-years-of-everyday-3d-animations---), which incorporates all the given feedback via Twitter, Discord and Candidate comments.**\n\n\n## **TL;DR**\nNounsLATAM is seeking $50K to develop, produce and distribute daily 3D animated Noun-themed videos on a global scope for six months. \nOur initial aim was to develop, produce and distribute over 800 engaging 3D animated Noun-themed videos on a global scale for 2 years of everyday animations.

If you have already read our Propdate (thank you), skip ahead to the Section \"Our Guiding Goals for Season 3.\" Otherwise, please read on! ⌐◨-◨*\n\n# **Proposal Summary:**\n\n**The Noun Square Onchain Media Collective is one of the most committed, effective and [Lindy](https://postimg.cc/tYtDP1vt) teams ever funded by Nouns.**\n\nWe have been making an impact on our community daily throughout Season 2 via Spaces, art contests, community support, video content and more, with a highly engaged network of fans that has produced nearly **6 Million unique content impressions** so far this year on X alone. \n\nWe've responded to Nouner feedback and leaned down our operations this year as much as possible, shifting focus to the creation of more rich video content, including a promising new weekly video podcast called **[Zero Rights Reserved](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTVC2ZZHVXuArObREO5PTfJr5S4uHTArB&si=oKkJ2sO4v5IN-iXQ)**, which has racked up over **350,000 views** across our socials in just 4 months. \n\nWe've also been trailblazers when it comes to Nouns on Ethereum L2's, onboarding our community to **Optimism, Zora** Network and soon **BASE** through various initiatives and educational content. \n\nUnique among funded Nouns projects, we have raised more than 20 ETH in operations funding from non-Nouns sources so far this year, and have stretched our previous 6 month mandate to 9+ months. \n\nToday, we are requesting 130 ETH (~6 Noun auctions at current FMV) to support the growth of our various initiatives for 6 more months.  \n\nEducational media and onboarding resources are an **integral Public Good** for the Ethereum ecosystem, and when a Nouns-funded initiative like TNS brings consistent value to our own sphere, while also spreading that love to other onchain communities... **we think that's Nounish to the core.**\n\n\n# Last Season, On The Noun Square...\n\n**A Short List of Notable Things We Accomplished During Season 2:** \n\n- We have remained steadfast in our commitment to act as a reliable daily touchpoint for the nouniverse, **hosting more than 500 Noun O' Clock LIVE shows in a row without missing a single day**, accumulating almost **40,000 total Spaces listens** year-to-date and impressive overall engagement metrics from our X Community, including an average of **20,000** impressions, **215** Likes and **112** Re-Posts **PER DAY.**\n- After receiving Nouner feedback, we pivoted much of our team energy into creating more pieces of engaging video content like **[\"This Week in Nouns\"](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTVC2ZZHVXuBZaPBVC__DW_HdEQim5a6w&si=be3WF3y0mAi4UYMV)**, **[Educational Tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTVC2ZZHVXuBM692fS5fW15VZ0tGBjts1&si=fij7H6coaiHs__JE)**, and our new weekly video podcast **[Zero Rights Reserved](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTVC2ZZHVXuArObREO5PTfJr5S4uHTArB&si=2iXB-u-jIpMeerjz)**.\n- We scaled back our original project scope considerably by sunsetting/\"open-sourcing\" the SoapBox program (more on this below), and leaned down the core team to do more with less, ultimately stretching a 6 month engagement to 9+ months.\n- We have raised a total of 20+ ETH so far towards the funding of our operations and contests via a combination of trial sponsorship collaborations with values-aligned groups, non-nouns grants awards, and our daily NOMO Edition mint proceeds. \n- We have positioned ourselves as a vanguard of nounish activity on Ethereum L2, educating and onboarding our community to the Optimism network via NOMO, the Zora Network through our weekly podcast open editions, and soon the BASE L2 with our imminent Yellow Collective launch. \n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n# 1) Consistency and Community-Building \n\nSo far this year, we have hosted **311** consecutive Noun O' Clock LIVE X Spaces, bringing our lifetime running total to **510 straight Spaces**. If you include our various other nounish Spaces as well, the total year-to-date jumps to 857 Spaces, which equates to 921 total hours on air, or a total of **38 full days of broadcasting nounish content**, with a total of **37,800** cumulative listeners. \n\n[![spaces-stats-red-bg.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/d1xdLB4R/spaces-stats-red-bg.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/wyD3rhK3)\n*YTD stats from Superspaces.ai*\n\nOn top of our daily Spaces participation, we have seen tremendous X/Twitter timeline engagement from the TNS community on our art contests, video content and other daily posts, with an impressive **5.9 Million impressions** so far year to date, which equates to nearly 20,000 impressions, 215 Likes and 112 Re-Posts per DAY. We've also completely organically grown our following by almost 100% to **9100 followers**, which makes us the largest nounish account by follower count on X after @nounsdao and our friends at @nounsesports.   \n\n[![spaces-stats-copy-fixed-full-year.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/SKbTM93h/spaces-stats-copy-fixed-full-year.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/FYGVtYhW)\n*YTD stats from X.com*\n\n\n\n---\n\nIn addition to serving as a consistent and reliable content hub for Nouns fans, we have also strived to be **a helpful media liaison to nounish subDAOs and funded Nouns projects**, helping to coordinate and host Twitter/X events, Discord events and more, and generally amplify their messaging to our network.\n\n**Some examples of this kind of community support:**\n- Supporting the \"Nouns: A Movie\" team by coordinating and hosting a watch party for their Rise of Blus Episode 1 Premiere, and amplifying their various announcements and initiatives like open casting calls, etc.\n- Supporting the Nouns AI pod by cohosting a weekly Update Call in our Discord that was free for anyone to join and keep up to date on what that team was building, as well as general news from the AI space. **([Example archive recording.](https://youtu.be/iKzf5ALz01A?si=Ajb4lsPNkOIGJANz))** We also produced this **[awesome video](https://x.com/TheHeroShep/status/1714689055248838840?s=20)** summarizing everything Nouns AI accomplished in 2023. \n- Supporting Nouns Esports by amplifying various contests and announcements, co-hosting weekly Twitter/X Spaces, and hosting a live **[watch party](https://x.com/nounsesports/status/1717691609356132612?s=20)** by request during their TI12 faceoff against Gaiman Gladiators.\n- Collaborating with Nouns Agora to host a **[Nouns Governance Discussion](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40thenounsquare%20%40nounsagora&src=typed_query&f=live)** most weeks on X Spaces with Yitong.\n- Supporting Brennen's **[Tavern project](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1717724845188796846?s=20)** by recently moving one day per week of Noun O' Clock LIVE to tavern.fm. (Not a Nouns-funded project per se, but Brennen is a Nouner and we like the duck.)  \n- Collaborating with Lil Nouns DAO's The Lil Nouns Show, and producing a feature video on their funded Lil Bevs proposal (tentative release date late November.)\n- Collaborating with subDAOs such as Lil Nouns DAO, Gnars, Food Nouns, Nouns Amigos, Nouns Japan, NounsCN, Nouns BR and more to host and cohost regular spaces for their communities.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Discovering and Empowering Nounish Artists:**\n\nOur art contests have continued to be very popular in terms of engagement, and also continue to impress in terms of quality and quantity of output. Here are a couple examples of winning entries from some of our many art contests this year:\n\n**Nounish Halloween Contest**\n\n[![halloween-contest-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/wBDnZ878/halloween-contest-gif.gif)](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1719770338379141525?s=20)\n\n**TNS Anniversary Art Contest Winners**\n\n[![anniversary-contest-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/28nVS3qP/anniversary-contest-gif.gif)](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1668684529484148736?s=20)\n\n\n\nWe constantly see new people tuning into our Spaces and engaging with our content, asking questions about Nouns, etc. in the days following an art contest. This is part of the reason why we have centered the vision of our upcoming Yellow Collective launch around funding and empowering as many nounish artists and creatives as possible (more below.)\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Crowd-Sourced \"FOMO\" Auction Settling:**\n\nSpeaking of art, another way that TNS has contributed to the Nouns ecosystem is by making a fun daily spectacle of choosing the new Noun of the Day on Noun O' Clock LIVE. \n\nWith the help of our audience, we have settled some pretty amazing Nouns this year, including some special ones for occasions, such as a Halloween Ghost, a Birthday Cake for Aug 8, a Black Cat for Token 666, etc. Some of these aesthetic Nouns have sold at auction for above-average prices, even despite the fork dynamic. Noun 658 (Dark Factory) for example **sold for 51 ETH, a full 25 ETH more than the average Noun was going for at that time.**\n\nWe also challenged ourselves earlier this year to try and mint every unminted Noun head, and succeeded just prior to the 2nd Nouniversary. We then challenged ourselves again to mint all the newly added heads as quickly as possible, and succeeded in less than 2 weeks. As a result, **[Proposal 401](https://nouns.wtf/noun/904)** was able to award every contributing artist an existing Noun with their own created head. \n\nHere is a small selection of the many very aesthetic Nouns we helped to mint so far this year: \n\n[![aesthetic-nouns.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/vB6qcD16/aesthetic-nouns.gif)](https://postimg.cc/0MPd4k08)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n# 2) A Fresh Focus on Video Content:\n\nDuring the earliest months of this season, TNS was producing and facilitating an average of 40 Twitter/X Spaces per week for various nounish communities. We sought and received feedback from nouners and our audience, and learned that their favorite content was our educational/informative video content on YouTube and TikTok, and so we decided as a team to shift our resources and attention towards **increasing the production of this kind of rich media content on a more regular basis.**\n\nSince that time, we have been producing an average of 5-8 high quality pieces of video content per month. Here are some notable examples of content produced by TNS this year: \n\n\n\n---\n\n**This Week in Nouns** Series (FKA Prop Talk): A 3 minute weekly video summarizing everything exciting that's happening in Nouns. Primarily an **[X-native release](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40thenounsquare%20%22this%20week%20in%20nouns%22&src=typeahead_click)**, these have received a combined **70,000+ views** so far this year.\n\n[![twin-gif-for-prop.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/D0Mn1F5S/twin-gif-for-prop.gif)](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1709595587232890942?s=20)\n*(Click GIF to Watch Video)*\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Crypto Advocacy / Gitcoin:** Nouns doesn't celebrate its wins often enough, so we decided to make a **[short video about our 100K donation to the Gitcoin Crypto Advocacy Round.](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1678837682565152770?s=20)** This piece of evergreen content has received nearly **30,000 views so far.** \n\n[![gitcoin-gif-for-prop.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/T2qk1ChX/gitcoin-gif-for-prop.gif)](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1678837682565152770?s=20)\n*(Click GIF to Watch Video)*\n\n---\n\n**Nouns AI pod** asked us to produce an engaging video about everything they had built in 2023. This was primarily an X release, but you can also watch it **[here on YouTube.](https://youtu.be/dvRuodQLXoc?si=Sv1NobSjXa8aK5Mu)**\n\n[![nounsai-gif-for-prop.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/j2mCtyp3/nounsai-gif-for-prop.gif)](https://youtu.be/dvRuodQLXoc?si=Sv1NobSjXa8aK5Mu)\n*(Click GIF to Watch Video)*\n\n---\n\n**Tutorials and Educational Videos About Onchain Life:** Our community loves learning about Ethereum, how to use L2s, how to apply for grants, etc. and our TNS Tutorials Series helps them along that path. Our **[Tutorials videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTVC2ZZHVXuBM692fS5fW15VZ0tGBjts1&si=vsbbrErNy6ILUUuh)** have accumulated over **50,000 views** this year across our socials. \n\n[![Screen-Shot-2023-11-06-at-4-26-47-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/NfxfNqMP/Screen-Shot-2023-11-06-at-4-26-47-PM.png)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTVC2ZZHVXuBM692fS5fW15VZ0tGBjts1&si=vsbbrErNy6ILUUuh)\n*(Click Image to Visit Playlist)*\n\n\n---\n\n**Notable Video Archives of Popular Twitter Spaces** Events such as our **[All About that Base event](https://youtu.be/U1B50NrIqVM?si=X7vDN5QEnIryZ2oC)** featuring Jesse Pollak, this Nouns **[RageQuit Debate](https://youtu.be/cRG2Zb3Cz4Q)** moderated by the Verbs team, this **[open discussion of Private Voting](https://youtu.be/K_EC54dSf80)**, this CC0 Round-table with **[Danny Cole and David Horvath](https://youtu.be/MSf-Aevh5Dk)**, etc.\n\n\n\n---\n\nThe **Zero Rights Reserved Podcast:** We are 16 episodes in so far and growing in popularity, with over **350,000 views** so far in 4 just months. (More on this initiative in the dedicated section below.)\n\n[![zeropod-website-header-thing-copy.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/PxhqMF5z/zeropod-website-header-thing-copy.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/hJygDsxf)\n\n\n---\n\n\nIn addition to our long-form content, we have also continued to leverage our TNS **[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquare?_t=8h8pOJQlvBn&_r=1)** **[Accounts](https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquarebr?_t=8h8pKkn4Zmi&_r=1)** to repurpose shorter versions of our videos, and platform-native shorts. We've continued to grow our English language and Brazilian Portuguese language accounts this year to a combined 38,500 followers, and have received over **150,000 views** on our short videos there YTD.  \n\n**Year-to-date, our video content has received over 650,000 views across our socials,** with 70% of that content coming in the latter part of the Season following our renewed emphasis on video production. We hope to continue this momentum into Season 3 and **surpass 1 million+ video views over the next 6 months.**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n# 3) The Zero Rights Reserved Podcast: Early Signs of Success\n\n[![zero-rights-reserved-intro-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/bJRYx7HT/zero-rights-reserved-intro-gif.gif)](https://postimg.cc/sQvRy0LQ)\n\n[**Zero Rights Reserved**](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/toady-hawk) is a weekly video podcast that we launched in June as part of our renewed focus on creating more rich digital media. It is a podcast about Nouns, DAOs, Ethereum, Art and more, and our goal is to interview interesting guests from around the onchain space from a Nounish perspective, while entertaining and educating our audience and bridging gaps to other like-minded communities. \n\nSo far, the podcast has been getting very good feedback from listeners both inside and outside the nouns community, as well as from the guests that we have hosted so far:\n\n[![zeropod-feedback.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fW785HM2/zeropod-feedback.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/V569kWrn)\n\n**Here is the list of our incredible guests so far:**\n- **[Jack Butcher](https://youtu.be/V4raMn3pCjQ?si=WcWJ-6vuUY9W3T26)** (Checks, Opepen, Visualize Value)\n- **[Bob Burnquist](https://youtu.be/2E13m-nsD9U?si=0c5uJ9vO3_q3y_6a)** (Skateboarding Legend)\n- **[Dan Romero](https://youtu.be/l4K9B53F8w0?si=JCVlUbBl5oi8JDI1)** (Farcaster Founder)\n- **[Luca Netz](https://youtu.be/HUZe7z_EORs?si=-pwrmaolOemr1e-Y)** (CEO Pudgy Penguins)\n- **[Chris Waters and Eric Towner](https://youtu.be/05B5BsWHF44?si=r6kLBMXPMU7eLmF7)** (Stoopid Buddy)\n- **[Supriyo](https://youtu.be/4RRQ_GqOzq8?si=-d9W9HqPs3zJE-Eg)** (Atrium, Nouns: A Movie)\n- **[Nate Angell](https://youtu.be/leNyYe4k6MA?si=B8hRbrK2eB3k5Rpz)** (Creative Commons)\n- **[Azeem Khan and Ben West](https://youtu.be/fAPxyHl_Yhk?si=TDOR3I66ntRPvAxt)** (Gitcoin)\n- **[Chris Carella](https://youtu.be/3JjblckvKZI?si=Zz7JZ4ppERV8-wQE)** (Purple, Energy)\n- **[Psych](https://youtu.be/1f6sUZlL1wE?si=ZUen2zhbXLWFeOl6)** (Cofounder Deadfellaz)\n- **[Snax](https://youtu.be/4xIL4vooNfM?si=sm57AU-X03NPQyad)** (Founder, Pizza DAO)\n- **[CryptoPunk Noah](https://youtu.be/lka91nApcc0?si=HAd6GsbRJ9oeMPAo)** (Artist, Prev Christie's, Yuga)\n- **[Amanda Terry](https://youtu.be/cD7J6QdrK28?si=cdOTMEiIsJ-XECw5)** (Cofounder, OnChainMonkey)\n- **[Aubtoshi](https://youtu.be/rrthX1cUxJY?si=WwVkI1h7PE3vbAwk)** (Nouns OTG)\n- **[Ed Balloon](https://youtu.be/1f6sUZlL1wE?si=Wbtabhx64GkXqUYI)** (Artist, Musician)\n- **[Binji Pande](https://youtu.be/V4raMn3pCjQ?si=fro8Y-Fbf1_oeS_B)** (Optimism Collective, OPLabs)\n\n*Upcoming guests (already recorded): Vinnie Hager, Grace and Brian Guan (founders of Unlonely.)*\n\n\n[![optimized-zzr-16-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/RFWGKmBr/optimized-zzr-16-gif.gif)](https://postimg.cc/njtvf6rT)\n\n\n\n**ZEROPOD** has also proven to be our most popular piece of recurring video content so far, racking up over **350K impressions across TNS socials for the first 16 episodes.** Podcast subscriptions and downloads are all steadily growing, and from a human-impact perspective, the initiative has been a great bridge to other values-aligned communities such as **Gitcoin, Checks/Opepen, Deadfellaz, OnChainMonkey, Optimism and more.** We have started to see more and more people from these other communities joining Noun O' Clock LIVE regularly to learn more about Nouns after having their interest piqued by the pod! \n\nOur goal for this next season is to continue to grow the podcast, **exceeding 1 million views across our socials for all episode content**, while continuing to attract similar high-caliber guests, and spending more resources on repurposing this abundance of nounish content into shorter vertical videos for use on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube shorts. \n\nWe have also been minting each episode of ZEROPOD as a special ONCHAIN collection on Zora using the Zora L2 network. **[You can check them out and mint them all for free here.](https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x20035fea4dd659553233fe5ea3ca207e6427b5eb)**\n\nLike all of our content at TNS, and as the name would imply, Zero Rights Reserved is fully CC0, and we have started to compile a simple repository of both raw and edited footage that anyone is free to use however they see fit. **You can view and use the repository[ here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bu09bV8M0DwiPQyWhU9lTE7cI2vJT34r?usp=sharing)**\n\n**We believe ZEROPOD has the potential to become our co-flaship production alongside Noun O' Clock LIVE. The former bringing in nouns-curious eyeballs from all over the web 3 space, while the latter acts as an effective sieve to catch artists and creatives and help them find ways to contribute meaningfully to the community.**\n\n\n\n---\n\n# 4) A Note About Team Adaptability\n\nAs mentioned previously, in the early part of this year, TNS was managing and facilitating up to 40 Twitter Spaces per week for communities such as Gnars, Lil Nouns, Unouns, Nouns Amigos, and more via our **SoapBox Program**. \n\nWhile we do maintain that the SoapBox program was impactful, and was certainly appreciated in many corners of the nouniverse, it also demanded a **lot** of labor to maintain in terms of scheduling, administration, social media messaging, hosting and coordination. As we started to receive feedback from Nouns DAO members that they did not feel SoapBox should be a primary focus for TNS, we made the difficult decision to mostly wind it down.\n\nSo as not to leave our communities in the lurch, we did the social media equivalent of making SoapBox \"open source\": We created a new X account called **TNS OpenMic**, where any nounsfolk can apply to host a show about any nounish community or topic of their choosing. We will still amplify where possible, but without the previous commitment of in-house scheduling, messaging, hosting, etc. Our vision for OpenMic is that it can act as a Public Access Channel for Nouns, where anyone can show up and spin up a Space with a built-in audience to iterate and try things out, but without the high administrative burden on TNS.\n\nAs a result of these and other changes to our day-to-day operations, we were able to stretch our previous mandate from 6 months to 9 months, and are presenting today a proposal that is almost 60% leaner than previoius asks.  \n\n\n\n---\n\n# 5) Promising Progress on Self-Funding & Alternative Funding Sources\n\nOne of our primary goals in Season 2 was to explore alternate sources of funding to become more self-sufficient as an organization, and we have explored this priority from three main angles: 1) Sponsorship collaborations, 2) Grants from other sources, and 3) Crypto Native revenue generation. \n\nOn item 1, we were able to negotiate 4 collaborations with values-aligned organizations plus a one-off video commission, for a total ETH value of 5.5 ETH. Thank you to Dawn Wallet, Gnars DAO and OnChainMonkey for being open to these collaborations so far. We are currently in discussions with various other organizations and protocols as well for future month-long content sponsorship opportunities. \n\nSecondly, we were extremely grateful to be awarded a Gitcoin Public Goods grant of 2.5 ETH for outstanding work in Web 3 Education and Onboarding, and a 5 ETH grant from Builder DAO to seed the imminently launching Yellow Collective treasury with funds to be used for nounish art contests and content commissions.\n\nAnd finally, we have brought in a total of 9.14 ETH YTD from our NOMO Nouns Daily Edition mints over the course of Season 2. We have also been iterating and evolving the NOMO collection and experience to make it more accessible for our audience. This summer, we migrated the collection to the Optimism L2 to solve the problem of a $7 daily mint that was costing $50 in gas to mint. Recently, we also made the decision to lower the mint cost from ~$7 to ~$1 to again encourage more broad participation from our community on a daily basis. \n\nWith these four sources combined, we have so far raised **22.14 ETH in outside revenue and grants, and we hope to double this amount in Season 3.**\n\nOne way that we will attempt to do that is with the launch of The Yellow Collective, a new TNS onchain club that will be deployed this month as a daily nounish auction on the BASE L2 using Nouns Builder. \n\n\n\n---\n\n# 6) Nouns on the OP Stack\n\n[![op-stack-infinity-stones-meme.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/j5LfcxDh/op-stack-infinity-stones-meme.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/JDCt4Wcy)\n\nWe noticed an interesting problem when talking to our community: Many wanted to \"Enjoy Ethereum\", but they were fed up with paying high gas fees on mainnet to do so. We decided to make it part of our mandate to teach our 50,000+ followers across socials about the benefits of using OP Stack L2 chains, and show them exactly how to do it.\n\nFirst, we migrated our daily edition collection \"NOMO Nouns\" from mainnet to OP, and produced some helpful tutorials on how to bridge ETH. Next, we started minting our Zero Rights Reserved podcasts as FREE mint collectibles on Zora L2 (shout out Jacob for helping us with this rollout.) \n\nFinally, we are in the midst of launching a \"DAO\" (onchain club) on BASE L2 using Nouns Builder this month, called The Yellow Collective. This Collective will be primarily focused on empowering artists and creatives through art contests and commissions, with collection art created by our community for our community. Check out the results of our **[Prop House Round for the first 50 heads here](https://prop.house/the-yellow-collective/the-yellow-collective-trait-contest-1:-best-noun-heads)**, and learn more about our plans for The Yellow Collective, and the BASE-deployed \"Collective Nouns\" daily auctions in our **[official announcement thread here.](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1704895027401417019?s=20)**\n\nThis diagram may also help to illustrate our three-pronged strategy for educating the Nouns community about the OP Stack, and the importance of Ethereum L2s:\n[![cr-w-2480-h-1240.webp](https://i.postimg.cc/mkHSPzMh/cr-w-2480-h-1240.webp)](https://postimg.cc/dZJCX05K)\n\n\nOne of our core ideals as an organization is to help create a safe and accessible place for people from all over the world to be able to Enjoy Nouns, and we are excited to leverage these L2 initiatives to do exactly that.  \n\nAnd on top of that, we're also just very excited for these Collective Nouns auctions to start... just look at these community-drawn traits! \n\n[![yellow-collective-finalists.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/65L0kWhh/yellow-collective-finalists.gif)](https://prop.house/the-yellow-collective/the-yellow-collective-trait-contest-1:-best-noun-heads)\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Our Guiding Goals for Season 3:\n\n- Remain consistent with our daily Twitter/X spaces and continue our current upward trajectory of followers and engagement on that platform, which would bring us to more than 14,000 followers, and a 6-month total of 1 million+ content impressions.\n- Grow and improve both the podcast and our YouTube channel content (which is already the second-largest channel in the nouniverse with 450 subscribers and also the fastest-growing channel with 150% subscriber growth this year.) We are targeting a similar rate of growth to hit our goal of 1000 Subscribers. As a baseline, we plan to produce and distribute at least 30 high quality pieces of video content in Season 3. \n- Make Zero Rights Reserved our co-flagship production alongside Noun O' Clock LIVE, leaning into the current momentum. (We have already recorded 1 month of future episodes with exciting guests like Vinnie Hager and the founders of Unlonely, still to air.)\n- Allocate more time and resources on making and using short clips from past and future ZEROPOD episodes for use on TikTok, Instagram and YT shorts (which are great content in and of themselves and also great drivers of listeners and subscribers back to the podcast.)\n- Double the total amount of funding from TNS initiatives and outside sources to at least 40 ETH. \n- Grow The Yellow Collective into the premiere nounish DAO (onchain club) on BASE as an accessible way for fans to discover nouns with the benefits of L2.  \n- Continue our mission of discovering and empowering nounish artists and creatives with the proceeds from daily auctions, running at least 20 contests for artists and creatives. \n- Update the Nouns community at minimum every 60 days with an onchain post on Propdates.wtf.\n\n# Budget and Requested Funding\n\nWe are requesting **130 ETH (~6 Nouns' worth at current FMV) for 6 months of operations** and our expected operational budgeting can be broken down as follows:\n\n-Art Contest Prizes Administration: 2 ETH/mo\n-Social Accounts Management: 3 ETH/mo\n-Spaces Hosting (NOC + All Others, Approx 50/month): 4.5 ETH/mo\n-Podcast organization, interviews, editing, production, distribution, etc: 4.5ETH/mo\n-Other Video Content Production and Distribution (This Week in Nouns, educational content, nouns project highlights, etc.): 3 ETH/mo\n-Short content creation and distribution for TikTok, instagram, YT reels, etc.: 1.5 ETH/mo\n-General Administration (Event Scheduling, Interview Scheduling, Prize Distribution, etc): 3 ETH/mo\n\n**Total expected budget operational cost per month: 21.5 ETH = 130 ETH Total**\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Core Team:**\n-**[Toady Hawk:](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk)** Project management, strategy, Spaces hosting, podcast hosting, video ideation, production, editing & distribution, social media management, administration.\n-**[Robotfishgirl](https://twitter.com/RobotFishGirl)**: Spaces hosting, discord moderation, strategy\n-**[JackWyldes:](https://twitter.com/JackWyldes)** Video ideation, production, hosting, editing.\n-**[Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi)**: Prize distribution, discord admin, strategy.\n-**[Xargs:](https://twitter.com/mamaxargs)** Discord admin, general administration, scheduling, international outreach\n-**[Santhosh:](https://)** Scheduling, video editing, short video editing\n-**[Joshua Fisher](https://twitter.com/JoshuaFisher)**: Art Contest Coordination and administration\n-**[Symbiotech:](https://twitter.com/Symbiotech)** Social media management, Discord moderation, NOMO community\n\n**Other Contributors:** [Cardno](https://twitter.com/CardnoNFT), [BrettDrawsStuff](https://twitter.com/BrettDrawsStuff), [Nikki](https://twitter.com/web3nikki), [JP](https://twitter.com/eusou_jp), [Davin](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye), [SuperTightWoody](https://twitter.com/SuperTightWoody), [Macki](https://twitter.com/_mackinac), [Satori](https://twitter.com/0xSatori).\n\nCore Team will collaborate to allocate funds to team members based on their contributions to the **weekly operations tasks budgets** outlined above.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Trusted 3/6 Multisig Members:**\nRobotfishgirl\nBenbodhi\nSupertightWoody\n[Maty.eth](https://twitter.com/matyETH)\nToady Hawk\n[Noun 142](https://twitter.com/noun142)\n\n\n\n---\n\n**We would like to thank Nouns for all of the opportunity and trust you have given TNS over the past 18 months, and we ask for your continued support here as we set out to do more with less and make an increasingly positive and tangible impact on the Nouniverse over the next 6 months.**\n\nIf you have any questions for us about the Proposal, please don't hesitate to pose a question here onchain, DM or post on X/Twitter or Farcaster @thenounsquare, or drop in our [TNS Discord](https://discord.gg/vh9TQbtR). \n\n**LFG!

It outlines the first steps which includes creating the first Nouns House and mobile app. As a second step, we plan to submit follow-up proposal by Feburary 2024 to transfer initial funding to the DAO treasury followed by successful execution of this proposal.\n\n**We have already established the Nouns House DAO multi-sig [treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC7181dc3863932F9b375bC348fe4A421B8003A), and all of the funding from this and future proposal will be going to the treasury.**\n\n***\n\n## TL;DR\n\nHello! I am **[tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth)**, co-founder of Enabler DAO (**[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/enabler.fun/)**, **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/enablerofficial)**, **[Website](https://enablerdao.com/)**). Our decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focuses on gathering, utilizing, managing, and improving idle assets like unused houses and cars within communities worldwide. My fellow co-founder at Enabler DAO, **[yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth)**, is a holder of **[Noun 312](https://nouns.wtf/noun/312)**, and we believe in the power and potential of NounsDAO just as you do.\n\nWe are proposing a funding of **47,600 USDC** to give a Nounish makeover to a vacation rental property in Tokyo, Japan, valued over $1,000,000 USD. We intend to create “Nouns House #1” with this funding. Our property has already completed interior and exterior renovations; **all of the funding will be used for the Nounish makeover, and development of the mobile app.**\n\nBeyond just providing the property for Nouns House #1, **we will contribute 10% of the profits made from Nouns House #1 to the Nouns House DAO treasury for the first 5 years**. For future Nouns Houses real estates that are funded by the treasury, 100% of the profits will be returned to the treasury.\n\nIn alignment with NounsDAO’s CC0 philosophy, we will make all software and hardware implemented in this project open source. Furthermore, we plan to collaborate with the Nouns projects that are active in Japan such as **[pNouns](https://pnouns.wtf/en/)** (**[Noun 553](https://nouns.wtf/noun/553)**, **[Noun 556](https://nouns.wtf/noun/556)**) for events and promotions.\n\n**The diverse industry experience of our team will significantly contribute to the success of this project.** **[yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth)** is a former executive CPO at Mercari, **[yukill.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukill.eth)** is a former CEO at ZOZO Technologies, **[Jiro](https://twitter.com/jiroisagame)** is a former YouTuber with 1.3 million subscribers, and I, **[tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth)**, am a former engineer from Amazon Seattle.\n\nThis proposal was inspired by **[Nouns Deli](https://twitter.com/NounsDeli)**’s proposal (**[Proposal 254](https://nouns.wtf/vote/254)**, approved on 03/09/2023). Our next step is to establish a Nounish subDAO, called “Nouns House DAO”. Similar to the **[Nouns Builder Protocol](https://nouns.build/)** (**[Proposal 167](https://nouns.wtf/vote/167)**, approved on 11/12/2022), we aim to create a subDAO inheriting NounsDAO’s auction, treasury, and governance system. In the follow-up proposal, we plan to request initial funding for Nouns House DAO treasury, in order to create Nouns House #2 and subsequent Nouns Houses based on community decisions governed by the DAO.\n\n## 1.  Nouns House DAO ⌐◧-◧\n\nNouns House #1 created through this proposal will serve as the first Nouns House governed by Nouns House DAO. Following the successful execution of this proposal, we will submit a follow-up proposal to transfer initial funding to the Nouns House DAO treasury. This initial funding will be substantial enough to secure the purchase of the second Nouns House. The exact amount, along with detailed plans and specific property information, will be disclosed in this follow-up proposal. We believe that having initial funding in the treasury will create strong momentum for this new Nounish DAO.\n\nOur goal is to establish Nouns Houses in major cities globally, allowing individuals to experience Nouns art and culture. Additionally, we aim to **operate this as a profitable venture**, positioning Nouns House DAO as the pioneering Nounish subDAO that introduces a **3rd revenue pillar for the treasury, complementing the NFT auctioning and ETH staking.**\n\nNouns House DAO will oversee the operation and financial management of all Nouns Houses. **As a testament to our commitment, we will contribute 10% of the profits from Nouns House #1 to treasury for the first 5 years.** For all subsequent real estates that are funded by the Nouns House DAO treasury, 100% of the profits will be directed back to the treasury.\n\n![Bedroom](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1W23f_T6aANo9mXh9-lUu3bypKSzU12M4)\n\n## 2. Enabler DAO / Core Team ⌐◧-◧\n\nEnabler DAO is a asset sharing community that aims to facilitate easy sharing of large assets like houses and cars by leveraging blockchain and AI technology. As of November 2023, we operate 10 properties across 5 locations (Tokyo, Kyoto, Atami, Teshikaga, and Honolulu) in Japan and the United States. These properties are monetized through asset sharing within the community as well as through Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) such as Airbnb and Booking.com. Below are some of our properties and links to OTAs.\n\n🇯🇵 [**WHITE HOUSE Atami**](https://airbnb.com/h/white-house-atami\n) - Shizuoka, Japan\n🇯🇵 [**MACHIYA Kyoto**](https://www.kyoto-machiya-inn.com/accommodations/hanatoki/\n) - Kyoto, Japan\n🇯🇵 [**THE NEST Teshikaga**](https://airbnb.com/h/the-nest-teshikaga) - Hokkaido, Japan\n🇺🇸 [**BEACH HOUSE Honolulu**](https://airbnb.com/h/beach-house-honolulu-annex) - Hawaii, USA\n\n![Properties](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1C5UfxmK62s98QryMGZ_SoTIpED1fTUru)\n\nThe 4 founders of Enabler DAO are **[yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth)** (**[Noun 312](https://nouns.wtf/noun/312)**), former executive CPO of Mercari; **[yukill.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukill.eth)**, former CEO at ZOZO Technologies & fund manager for MZ Web3 Fund; **[Jiro](https://twitter.com/jiroisagame)**, former YouTuber “Charisma Brothers” with 1.3 million subscribers & managing partner at iFund; and **[tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth)**, a trilingual former Amazon HQ engineer with 5-years of experience. \n\nEnabler DAO was founded in October 2021, and we currently operate with about 10 DAO members. We have been operating highly successful and profitable vacation rental properties in multiple locations (10~20% annual ROI), and bring expertise in both rental operations and property management. Moreover, our diverse team brings a wide range of business and product development experience, combined with our strong track record, **I believe we are in a unique position to be successful at running the first Nouns House.**\n\n## **3. Nounish Makeover ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe plan to transform our property in Aoyama, an upscale district in Tokyo, into \"Nouns House #1,\" with a Nounish makeover filled with art and goodies. \n\n![Living Room](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bwo_xZOKns30glLVRyeoQ7ROKojrQkIE)\n\nAoyama is a hub of designer boutiques, art galleries, cafes, and shopping districts. It's not only a attracts for affluent individuals but also a popular tourist destination. Given the area's reputation and successful track record of our nearby properties, **we anticipate strong demand for high-end vacation rental property in Aoyama.**\n\n![Sauna](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1kabDge7tB6HDlZqn1fYccFdnsMt0-AdX)\n\nIn recent years, there has been a “sauna boom” in Japan. The number of sauna enthusiasts has been increasing due to heightened health consciousness and the proliferation of sauna facilities. In fact, the number of sauna users in Japan has increased by more than one million in the past year, and high-end sauna facilities in Tokyo are extremely popular. **We believe that Nouns House #1 will become widely popular within the sauna communities and beyond.**\n\n![Bath](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=190MOtkZF68sFwLUJzwbxoO4hNEtKDfch)\n\nThe artwork used for interior and exterior of Nouns House #1 will be directed by [amiyoko.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/amiyoko.eth) who have contributed many artwork to various Nouns projects such as NounsDAO Anniversary Art 2023 and Sushi Nouns.\n\n![Exterior](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bESaiRK3zLewixG-8MvEEq9HgIhnkbqc)\n\nThe 1st floor is the sauna area, the 2nd floor features a living-dining-kitchen area, and the 3rd floor will be an office space and a bedroom. We aim to infuse each floor with Nounish elements while maintaining a sense of luxury in the interior design.\n\n![Chill](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1CvxZml-3RPmPaHxNUzN7yUE2DKu-wLyU)\n\n## 4. Marketing Efforts **⌐◧-◧**\n\nTo amplify the presence of Nouns House #1, **we will be forming a strategic partnership with a popular Japanese YouTuber group, [EvisJap](https://youtube.com/@EvisJap?si=6Oi6Ll6fIzis70ib).** With a subscriber base of 630,000, primarily young adults, they are known for their energetic travel blogs and lively social gatherings that resonate with the adventurous spirit of youth.\n\nDuring the weekdays, EvisJap will be utilizing Nouns House #1 as their recording studio, bringing a creative buzz to the space while providing regular exposure of Nouns to a broad audience through their videos. On weekends, Nouns House #1 will transform into an luxury private sauna. This dual-use approach optimizes the utility of the property, and exemplifies the innovative and adaptive spirit of the Nouns.\n\nThis collaboration, born from our unique relationship with EbisJap, is a synergy that offers exposure to Nouns House without direct marketing efforts. The value of this organic promotion is an example of the unique contribution that our team brings to the Nouns community.\n\n## **5. Mobile App ⌐◧-◧**\n\n**We will develop a mobile app for facilitating reservations and assigning maintenance work for Nouns House DAO**. This app will be powered by open-source framework called **[Skeet](https://skeet.dev/en/)** which seamlessly integrates with Google Cloud Platform and Firebase, making it easier to develop serverless full-stack applications. \n\nIt's worth noting that both Enabler and **[El Soul Labo](https://labo.elsoul.nl/en/)**, the team behind Skeet, received equity funding from **[East Ventures](https://east.vc/)**, one of the biggest venture capital fund in Asia. With the cutting edge Skeet framework and the invaluable support from the creator of Skeet, we can efficiently develop this app with just one engineer on our end.\n\nThe app will integrate with existing tools that offers API such as **[Beds24](https://beds24.com/)** for inventory management, **[Sesame Smart Lock](https://jp.candyhouse.co/)** for automatically issuing one-time guest keys, and **[Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-jp)** for fiat payment processing. In the interim, before our app release, we'll use **[LINE](https://line.me/en/)** and **[LINE Marketplace](https://line-marketplace.com/jp/app)** apps for chat-based reservation.\n\nFurthermore, we will incorporate web3 capabilities such as token-gating and cryptocurrency payment into the app. We plan to offer special coupons and priority reservations to Nouns House NFT holders, and allow payments in major cryptocurrencies.\n\n## **6. Utility Token ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe plan to introduce a utility token which will be used for accessing Nouns House and can be earned through completing maintenance gigs listed in the app. **We envision some members of the Nouns House DAO to work maintenance gigs in order to earn the utility token.** We plan to use Solana chain for the token for 3 reasons: near-zero gas fees, rapid execution, and its integration with the user-friendly multi-chain wallet called Phantom. Enabler DAO has already been experimenting with Solana based utility token called [**EBR**](https://solscan.io/token/E1JxwaWRd8nw8vDdWMdqwdbXGBshqDcnTcinHzNMqg2Y) (available on [**Orca DEX**](https://v1.orca.so/liquidity/browse?tokenMint=E1JxwaWRd8nw8vDdWMdqwdbXGBshqDcnTcinHzNMqg2Y)) and have experience in this realm.\n\n## **7. Roadmap ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe will begin the Nounish makeover and the development of mobile app, immediately following the approval of this proposal. In January 2024, we plan to pre-open Nouns House #1, followed by grand opening in February. Beta version of mobile app will be released in March, followed by production release in April. We will submit submit a follow-up proposal by Feburary 2024 to transfer initial funding for the DAO treasury followed by successful execution of this proposal.\n\n![Roadmap](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1xkl6xzFYEi-rAtpjmnARWpc34Pj_Dlh4)\n\n## **8. Budget ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe are proposing **47,600 USDC funding for creating Nouns House #1 and to kick start the software infrastructure development for Nouns House DAO.** The Nounish makeover will cost $17,000, and the development of the mobile app will cost $30,600. All work will commence immediately upon the approval of the proposal.\n\n**Nouns House #1 Nounish Makeover: $17,000**\n- \"Nounish\" Exterior Wall Art: $6,000\n- \"Nounish\" Interior Art: $8,000\n- \"Nounish\" Goodies: $3,000\n\n**Mobile App (6-month development): $30,600**\n- Founding Engineer: $5,000/month\n- [Skeet](https://skeet.dev/en/) (Enterprise Support): $100/month\n\n## **9. Community Benefits ⌐◧-◧**\n\nThis proposal aims to **expand the Nouns community by creating the first \"Nouns House\", a network of properties where people can experience Nouns art and culture in major cities worldwide.**\n\nIn the next step, we will propose to transfer initial funding for Nouns House DAO treasury. This new Nounish subDAO will own Real World Asset (RWA) and operate them as a profit-making business. RWA is an area where the web3 industry is still struggling, and this new venture has the potential to significantly advance the industry on this front.\n\nNouns House NFT holders will be offered special perks such as discounted rates and priority access to Nouns Houses via token gating. Additionally, upon the funding of the Nouns House DAO treasury in our next proposal, **existing Nouns NFT holders can apply for Nouns House NFT airdrop by a pre-determined date**. This airdrop is optional and provides an opportunity for existing NounsDAO members to participate in the governance for Nouns House DAO without having to bid in the auction.\n\n## **10. CC0 ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe believe, Nouns House’s CC0 culture will bring innovation to the real estate industry. While real estate design and architecture are generally not open-source, we will make all of these publicly available through our CC0 library. CC0 approach will also have a large impact on the vacation rental industry. **By providing tools to help achieve efficient operations, we will accelerate the automation and digital transformation of the vacation rental industry.** The interest and attention that this CC0 model will generate within these industries will serve as the ideal platform for spreading the culture and values of Nouns.\n\n## **11. Risks & Considerations ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe are enthusiastic members of the Nouns community and, as Noun owner, strongly resonate with the vision of Nouns. **We believe that the Nouns model holds innovative power in asset management and vacation rental fields.** This decentralized, community-led governance model has the potential to offer new approaches in asset sharing and feels like the ideal way to manage assets in a decentralized manner. On the other hand, there are some risks considered in achieving the vision of this project:\n\n1. **Regulatory Risk**: Operating within a decentralized framework could potentially make the project subject to regulations. Compliance with local laws is crucial.\n2. **Technical Risk**: The integration of blockchain technology with physical assets like real estate presents several challenges. The implementation of smart contracts to manage the property must be executed flawlessly.\n3. **Community Engagement**: The strength of a DAO lies in its community. For long-term success, it's important to maintain community engagement and participation in governance.\n\nBy acknowledging these risks and proactively addressing them, we aim for the success of the Nouns House project."},{"blockNumber":18558691,"blockHash":"0x01b8780ce1388706e62ad49dcb69c53b3b2d574c47f1462838287266190be80a","transactionIndex":86,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x3256acb978d66695989d4c7c631b94115f99091567c0be4940dfa376e8201b5f","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":438,"proposer":"0xdcf37d8Aa17142f053AAA7dc56025aB00D897a19","targets":["0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03","0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03"],"signatures":["safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)","safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef7100000000000000000000000066cd193d0c0fb3b9b44dd371107617a7e9f381840000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000064","0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef7100000000000000000000000035f2a10b73aa0b5d8dc6639c51af7d5ddcd1846a0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000225"],"startBlock":18580291,"endBlock":18609091,"description":"# Gift Nouns to Nounish Founders: Lil Nounders\n\n**tl;dr - Honor early founders of nounish communities: Lil Nounders**\n\nThis is the third of a set of proposals to gift Nouns to the founders of the first three Nouns forks who proliferated Nouns via unique iterations of nounish DAOs which evolved into the largest nounish communities today.\n\nI feel the reputation of these founders precedes them, so I'll be brief.

We're not seeing additional forks being initiated by long-time nouners.\n* Book value has been lowered from the mid-30 ETH range to mid-20 ETH range through important bets on [Gnars ($300k)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/382), [Nouns Stories + Stoopid Buddy ($1.8M)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/397), [Protocol Guild Animation Film ($400k)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/407), [Nounish ($1M)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/413), [Messhup's Graphic Novel ($100k)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/423), [Rise of Blus ($1.1M)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/425), and likely [The Nouns Square ($270k)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/434). Happy with these high conviction bets.\n\nNow that we don't really need to worry about (for the time being) fundamentally misaligned long-time nouners being stuck in the DAO, we're in a position of mostly just dealing with arbitrageurs.\n\nI wouldn't be a proponent of raising the fork threshold if that meant arbitraguers would just accumulate more Nouns for longer, but given that the BV is now already lower, [arb modelling by the Verbs team](https://mirror.xyz/verbsteam.eth/W4gaOrp6NC6jopc6vGsGuhz3o4ej0G_0TFhBlcLed94) is showing that if we raise the fork threshold to 30% the expected BV at next fork would be in the low-10 ETH range, which means that if the true market clearing price is above that then we should start seeing real buyers outbid the arbitrageurs immediately.\n\nWe could just wait out a few more months for BV to naturally lower and the problem to resolve itself, but the benefits of adding new DAO members and getting true price discovery sooner in my opinion outweighs the governance overhead of adjusting the fork threshold and thus I propose we raise the fork threshold to 30% now."},{"blockNumber":18564816,"blockHash":"0x10f76b5a907f76bcfd54375cf7ceac9514f0eac6ae5c2fb4407b3858c14215c7","transactionIndex":116,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x0bbdc0fbace5272b4887d7e4d10c18478ba704852b8363079b12892f7006bc16","eventName":"ProposalCreated","eventSignature":"ProposalCreated(uint256,address,address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,string)","id":440,"proposer":"0xF952A0788137Cef8Cba0B315a042262Ddc12c3aF","targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000001cd2f6a466e12136a9e0b691bf86b0ca5f7a70ec0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001176592e00"],"startBlock":18586416,"endBlock":18615216,"description":"# One Noun, Every Day, Forever... in an Action Rogue-Lite Game!

We will also explore the game mechanics and creative direction with the Nouns community to discover product-market fit.\n\nPlay our pre-production demo [here](https://thepixelshop.itch.io/nounstown-demo)!\n\n# A Vertical Slice of One Noun, Every Day\n\n![stage_nouns_v_souls.png](https://i.imgur.com/hK0MOWs.png)\n\n**The One Noun, Every Day game mode will be the hook and anchor behind this game.  We want to re-imagine the continuity and diversity of Nouns through the lens of a dynamic and captivating game for the masses**.  \n\nJust as each blockchain hash determines the traits for each noun, every day, we will use a game seed to generate new elements for a each game, every day.  These changing elements include Nouns equipped with fun and diverse items, a generative world map populated with vibrant environments, random upgrades available to select from, and enemy minions and bosses you must battle to win.  Every player will have a 24 hour rolling period to defeat each version of the game.  This innovative mechanic has the potential to fuel a social and competitive gaming culture due to the following reasons:\n\n- Replayability - Optimize gameplay strategies through trial and error as you explore new characters and maps\n- Progression - Unlock new content and playable characters to use in the “Classic Mode” by defeating the game and a robust achievement system\n- Competition - Compete against all other players for the fastest clear time, and more importantly, bragging rights!\n- Game Metas - Discover unpredictable metas in a dynamic Nounish world\n\n## **Funding Details and Deliverables**\n\n**We are asking for $75,000 to develop a polished and playable vertical slice of the One Noun, Every Day game loop to demonstrate our intended player experience.** \n\nThis funding request provides for a $65,000 production budget (approximately 1,500 hours) and a $10,000 marketing budget, over an approximately 3-month period.  Key features required to produce this vertical slice include player character design, items and upgrades, environment design, sound design, UI/UX, and a single boss encounter.  Each feature will go through design and documentation, art and animation, programming and development, sound design, and testing and quality assurance, as applicable.  The deliverables and estimated allocation are as follows:\n\n- 1 Boss Encounter - 20 percent or 300 hours\n- Generative Map and Environment Assets - 20 percent or 300 hours\n- 7 Items and 7 Upgrades - 15 percent or 225 hours\n- 7 Rotating Nouns Characters - 15 percent or 225 hours\n- Sound design for completed features - 10 percent or 150 hours\n- Functional UI/UX for Menus and Gameplay - 10 percent or 150 hours\n- Comprehensive Game Design Document - 10 percent or 150 hours\n\nWe have allocated a marketing budget of $10,000 to produce the following deliverables:\n\n- Branding and Marketing Assets\n- Establish Social Media presence and Steam Page\n- Professional Teaser Trailer\n\n# Creative Direction\n\n## Nouns\n\nOur game embraces a clash of two starkly contrasting worlds. On one side, the Nounish personality will be at the core of the player character, the items and upgrades you acquire during each run, and NPCs you discover over time.  These elements will be designed to permeate Nounish personality through vibrant colors, joyful energy, and whimsical ideas. \n\n### Items\n\nWe are exploring ideas that are “outside of the box” and consistent with the outlandish and diversely strange Nouns world.  \n\n### Upgrades\n\nAs the player clears each room,  they are rewarded a pair of Noggles that unlocks a powerful new upgrade to use during the run.  Players will experiment with different combinations of upgrades to create fun synergies and provide a unique gameplay experience each run.  Each upgrade is inspired by various characters from the Nouns collection.  \n\n## Forgotten Souls\n\nAnd on the other side, you'll uncover the corrupt Forgotten Souls that have crossed into the Nouniverse upon discovering the power of Noggles.  The Souls are holding Nouns captive in their inanimate forms and using the power from the stolen Noggles to convert the Nouniverse into their own shadowy realm.  The Souls will serve as the enemy minions, bosses, and antagonist of our game, designed with contrasting dark personalities and colors.  \n\n### Minions\n\nAll minions will be designed to showcase their haunting personalities through fantastical and diverse character design, animations, and attack styles.  The contrasting nature of the minions will provide for an aesthetic design that emphasizes readability and a visual feeling of cleansing the corruption from Nouns Town as the player progresses.  \n\n![Minions](https://i.imgur.com/aZx9FC4.png)\n\n### Bosses\n\nOur boss encounters thrive to be one of the more memorable experiences that you will encounter in our game.  Our bosses will be inspired by rare Forgotten Souls characters but have our own stylistic flare.  These boss encounters will be visually stunning and paired with cohesive game play mechanics that immerse and challenge the player.  \n\n## Environment\n\nThe collision of these two distinct moods creates a captivating experience.  Each run will begin as a corrupt Nouniverse that has taken over by the Souls.  As the player progresses through the map, the corruption is pushed back and the vibrant Nounish world is slowly restored!  \n\nWe’ll design Nounish locations with their own distinct aesthetics and corresponding play styles.  Each location on the map will go through a similar design process and produce the following deliverables:\n\n- Concept Design - Establish the location’s identity with clearly defined characteristics\n- Map Assets - Represent each location by a low resolution design on the map\n- Tile Sets -  Outfit the walls, floors, and objects within the rooms of each location.  The following tile set was used in our demo and will receive a Nounish update:\n    ![Demo Tileset](https://i.imgur.com/Bc2Ms0C.png)\n- Decorations and Objects - Fill each room with decorations for personality and destructible objects for an interactive setting\n\n## Creative Commons\n\nAll of the art and animations that we produce will be open-source and available for anyone to use!\n\n# Future Vision\n\n**The goal of this proposal is to “follow the fun” through addicting game play and Nounish creative expressions.  However, we have a long term vision to produce and distribute a fully fleshed out Nouns indie game.**\n\n### Additional Classic Mode\n\nOur core game loop will be the One Noun, Every Day game mode.  However, as the player character and map remain constant in this game mode, we also plan to release a Classic Mode to serve as a more traditional rogue-lite focused on randomness and meta progression, or progression that exists outside of regular gameplay.  In this mode, no two runs will be the same as a fresh new map is generated with each play through.  \n\nBut there’s also significant depth beyond the randomness.  This mode will be accompanied with a robust achievement system that challenges the player to unlock exciting new items, upgrades, and cosmetics.  \n\n### Organic Growth\n\nDuring development, we’ll maintain a steady pipeline of project updates, promotional content, and social engagement to generate organic growth.  Additionally, we plan to attend major game development conventions such as GDC, PAX, and Gamescon to engage with our community in person.  \n\n### Game Distribution\n\nWe will use Steam as our primary distribution platform to release the game.  Steam provides access to the largest PC gaming community, as well as extensive marketing and analytics features.  We will explore porting the game to Nintendo Switch post-release to reach a wider audience.\n\n## Collaboration\n\n### Nouns Community\n\nWe are committed to an open and inclusive collaboration process throughout production.  We will regularly engage with select community members to explore creative discussions, validate game design concepts, and explore marketing opportunities.  Our goal is to create an immersive game that represents the Nounish identity and resonates with both the community and the player.  \n\n### Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult\n\nThe game will be in collaboration with our friends from the Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult.  Their team is well-respected and produce engaging and high-quality products and experiences.  This collaboration brings promotional support from both their community and team’s established network within the gaming, content creation, and entertainment industries.  This partnership presents an opportunity to elevate our game, expand its reach, and enhance the prospect for breakout success.\n\n### Nouns Esports\n\nWe will collaborate with Nouns Esports to generate excitement and promotional content with the game launch.  This partnership will explore ideas to engage the Nouns gaming community primarily through streaming, competitions, and giveaways.  \n\n# Why a Nounish indie game?\n\nA rogue-lite indie game provides a compelling opportunity for Nouns to enter the gaming sector:\n\n### Creative Expression\n\nIndie games provide for a perfect landscape to build a Nounish world complete with innovative game mechanics that are complimented with vibrant aesthetics and visual representation.  We aim to populate our world with original Nouns characters, an outlandish environment, and charming storytelling to engage players and cultivate a connection to Nouns culture.    \n\n### Strategic Advantages\n\nOur small indie team provides several advantages including streamlined communication, transparency, adaptability, and a strong team synergy.  Yet, while being a small team, we have access to powerful platforms such as Godot for development, Steam for distribution, and social media and Discord for our community.  Our game is thoughtfully designed to pack a punch with addictive gameplay mechanics, engaging progression and replayability, and long-term scalability and new content.  We’re able to accomplish all of this within a reasonable scope and production budget, and without sacrificing on the game’s entertainment or aesthetics.\n\n## Genre\n\nOur genre of choice may be a mouthful (Non Linear Action Rogue-Lite Bullet Hell…) but it’s a great platform for a Nouns game.  The generative rogue features share a strong parallel with the Nounish identity; bullet hells offer replayability.  We have described the key features of each sub-genres and the games that inspire us below:\n\n### Rogue-Lite\n\nThe key feature of a Rogue-Lite genre is a game loop that results in permadeath.  Each time a player begins their attempt or run, they will either defeat the final boss or die trying.  A Rogue-Lite game generally involves some meta progression that takes place outside of the run; usually in the form of upgraded items, statistics, abilities, or skill trees.\n\n### Bullet Hell\n\nBullet Hell combat mechanics emphasize complex bullet patterns for the player to navigate and dodge.  Our bullet hell game will be designed as a twin stick shooter where the player is on a flat plane with a top-down perspective.  \n\n### Non-Linear Progression\n\nOne of the unique selling points of our Rogue-Lite game is that it will have Non-Linear progression.  The two main features to highlight in this design include a unique map that is generated each run and the freedom for the player to decide their order of progression.   \n\n### Inspiration\n[Enter the Gungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/), [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/), [Risk of Rain 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/), [Nuclear Throne](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/Nuclear_Throne/), [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/)\n\n# Why The Pixel Shop?\n\n![The Pixel Shop](https://i.imgur.com/57yu7tx.png)\n\n[The Pixel Shop](https://thepixelshop.app) is an independent Art and Game Development studio founded in March 2022.

V2\n\n![Header](https://i.imgur.com/YBiw7Zu.gif)\n**Play as One Noun, Every Day, Forever, in an action rogue-lite game developed in collaboration with Nouns and Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult to be released on Steam/PC!**\n\n### **TL;DR**\nWe are asking for $75,000 to deliver a polished and playable vertical slice for our indie Nouns game developed in Godot 4.  We will also explore the game mechanics and creative direction with the Nouns community to discover product-market fit.\n\nChanges from [Prop 414 (Version 1)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/414):\n- Focused attention on our One Noun, Every Day core mechanic and game play \n- Expanded on creative direction and process to capture the Nounish personality\n- Provided a detailed scope for the vertical slice deliverables\n- Added long term vision for collaboration with the Nouns community, and strategy partnerships with Nouns Esports and Forgotten Runes Wizard's Cult\n\n**Play our pre-production Demo [HERE](https://thepixelshop.itch.io/nounstown-demo)!**\n\n# A Vertical Slice of One Noun, Every Day\n\n![stage_nouns_v_souls.png](https://i.imgur.com/pBTUbZl.png)\n\n**The One Noun, Every Day game mode will be the hook and anchor behind this game.  We want to re-imagine the continuity and diversity of Nouns through the lens of a dynamic and captivating game for the masses**.  \n\nJust as each blockchain hash determines the traits for each noun, every day, we will use a game seed to generate new elements for a each game, every day.  These changing elements include Nouns equipped with fun and diverse items, a generative world map populated with vibrant environments, random upgrades available to select from, and enemy minions and bosses you must battle to win.  Every player will have a 24 hour rolling period to defeat each version of the game.  This innovative mechanic has the potential to fuel a social and competitive gaming culture due to the following reasons:\n\n- Replayability - Optimize gameplay strategies through trial and error as you explore new characters and maps\n- Progression - Unlock new content and playable characters to use in the “Classic Mode” by defeating the game and a robust achievement system\n- Competition - Compete against all other players for the fastest clear time, and more importantly, bragging rights!\n- Game Metas - Discover unpredictable metas in a dynamic Nounish world\n\n## **Funding Details and Deliverables**\n\n**We are asking for $75,000 to develop a polished and playable vertical slice of the One Noun, Every Day game loop to demonstrate our intended player experience.** \n\nThis funding request provides for a $65,000 production budget (approximately 1,500 hours) and a $10,000 marketing budget, over an approximately 3-month period.  Key features required to produce this vertical slice include player character design, items and upgrades, environment design, sound design, UI/UX, and a single boss encounter.  Each feature will go through design and documentation, art and animation, programming and development, sound design, and testing and quality assurance, as applicable.  The deliverables and estimated allocation are as follows:\n\n- 1 Boss Encounter - 20 percent or 300 hours\n- Generative Map and Environment Assets - 20 percent or 300 hours\n- 7 Items and 7 Upgrades - 15 percent or 225 hours\n- 7 Rotating Nouns Characters - 15 percent or 225 hours\n- Sound design for completed features - 10 percent or 150 hours\n- Functional UI/UX for Menus and Gameplay - 10 percent or 150 hours\n- Comprehensive Game Design Document - 10 percent or 150 hours\n\nWe have allocated a marketing budget of $10,000 to produce the following deliverables:\n\n- Branding and Marketing Assets\n- Establish Social Media presence and Steam Page\n- Professional Teaser Trailer\n\n# Creative Direction\n![Comic Strip](https://i.imgur.com/Aw5LE39.png)\n## Nouns\n\nOur game embraces a clash of two starkly contrasting worlds. On one side, the Nounish personality will be at the core of the player character, the items and upgrades you acquire during each run, and NPCs you discover over time.  These elements will be designed to permeate Nounish personality through vibrant colors, joyful energy, and whimsical ideas. \n\n### Items\n\nWe are exploring ideas that are “outside of the box” and consistent with the outlandish and diversely strange Nouns world.  These items will be packed with personality but also provide distinct play styles.  Early concepts we have explored include the Gnome Chuckaz, Sliced Bread Shurikens, and Pinata Blitzers:\n![item concepts](https://i.imgur.com/i2ciy7e.png)\n*Concept design for potential items*\n### Upgrades\n\nAs the player clears each room,  they are rewarded a pair of Noggles that unlocks a powerful new upgrade to use during the run.  Players will experiment with different combinations of upgrades to create fun synergies and provide a unique gameplay experience each run.  Each upgrade is inspired by various characters from the Nouns collection. \n![upgrade concepts](https://i.imgur.com/rUVjlxX.png) \n\n\n## Forgotten Souls\n\nAnd on the other side, you'll uncover the corrupt Forgotten Souls that have crossed into the Nouniverse upon discovering the power of Noggles.  The Souls are holding Nouns captive in their inanimate forms and using the power from the stolen Noggles to convert the Nouniverse into their own shadowy realm.  The Souls will serve as the enemy minions, bosses, and antagonist of our game, designed with contrasting dark personalities and colors.  \n\n### Minions\n\nAll minions will be designed to showcase their haunting personalities through fantastical and diverse character design, animations, and attack styles.  The contrasting nature of the minions will provide for an aesthetic design that emphasizes readability and a visual feeling of cleansing the corruption from Nouns Town as the player progresses.  \n![Minions](https://i.imgur.com/aZx9FC4.png)\n\n\n### Bosses\n\nOur boss encounters thrive to be one of the more memorable experiences that you will encounter in our game.  Our bosses will be inspired by rare Forgotten Souls characters but have our own stylistic flare.  These boss encounters will be visually stunning and paired with cohesive game play mechanics that immerse and challenge the player.  \n\n## Environment\n\nThe collision of these two distinct moods creates a captivating experience.  Each run will begin as a corrupt Nouniverse that has taken over by the Souls.  As the player progresses through the map, the corruption is pushed back and the vibrant Nounish world is slowly restored!  \n\n![World Concept](https://i.imgur.com/qC0bTvv.png)\n*Concept design for an environment that we will design a tile set for*\n\nWe’ll design Nounish locations with their own distinct and colorful themes, from quaint towns and snowy wonderlands, to barren deserts and tropical beaches.  Each playable location will go through a similar design process and produce the following deliverables:\n\n- Concept Design - Establish the location’s identity with clearly defined characteristics\n- Map Assets - Represent each location by a low resolution design in the Overworld Map\n- Tile Sets -  Outfit the walls, floors, and objects within the rooms of each location.  \n- Decorations and Objects - Fill each room with decorations for personality and destructible objects for an interactive setting\n    ![Demo Tileset](https://i.imgur.com/Bc2Ms0C.png)\n*Concept tile set used in demo that will receive a Nounish update*\n## Creative Commons\n\nAll of the art and animations that we produce will be open-source and available for anyone to use!\n\n# Future Vision\n\n**The goal of this proposal is to “follow the fun” through addicting game play and Nounish creative expressions.  However, we have a long term vision to produce and distribute a fully fleshed out Nouns indie game.**\n\n### Additional Classic Mode\n\nOur core game loop will be the One Noun, Every Day game mode.  However, as the player character and map remain constant in this game mode, we also plan to release a Classic Mode to serve as a more traditional rogue-lite focused on randomness and meta progression, or progression that exists outside of regular gameplay.  In this mode, no two runs will be the same as a fresh new map is generated with each play through.  \n\nBut there’s also significant depth beyond the randomness.  This mode will be accompanied with a robust achievement system that challenges the player to unlock exciting new items, upgrades, and cosmetics.  \n\n### Organic Growth\n\nDuring development, we’ll maintain a steady pipeline of project updates, promotional content, and social engagement to generate organic growth.  Additionally, we plan to attend major game development conventions such as GDC, PAX, and Gamescon to engage with our community in person.  \n\n### Game Distribution\n\nWe will use Steam as our primary distribution platform to release the game.  Steam provides access to the largest PC gaming community, as well as extensive marketing and analytics features.  We will explore porting the game to Nintendo Switch post-release to reach a wider audience.\n\n## Collaboration\n\n### Nouns Community\n\nWe are committed to an open and inclusive collaboration process throughout production.  We will regularly engage with select community members to explore creative discussions, validate game design concepts, and explore marketing opportunities.  Our goal is to create an immersive game that represents the Nounish identity and resonates with both the community and the player.  \n\n### Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult\n\nThe game will be in collaboration with our friends from the Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult.  Their team is well-respected and produce engaging and high-quality products and experiences.  This collaboration brings promotional support from both their community and team’s established network within the gaming, content creation, and entertainment industries.  This partnership presents an opportunity to elevate our game, expand its reach, and enhance the prospect for breakout success.\n\n### Nouns Esports\n\nWe will collaborate with Nouns Esports to generate excitement and promotional content with the game launch.

Technically, this change involves refunding tx.origin instead of msg.sender.\n\nExact changes can be seen in [this pull request](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/813).\n\nBecause this change is very minor, we're not going through an official audit process. This change has been reviewed by solimander.\n\n## Why this happened\n\nWe started work on V3 before the V2.1 fix, and V3 is in different files so syncing the master branch into the V3 branch did not apply the fix to V3 code.\n\nHere’s a short sequence of events:\n\n1. September 22, 2022 [v3 branch]: the branch that later becomes DAO V3 is created with initial code experiments.\n2. October 25, 2022 [dao 2.1 branch]: refund bug fixed.\n3. November 2, 2022 [v3 branch]: we sync from master and create a new DAO V3 file.\n4. November 9, 2022 [master] refund fix merged into master, to be deployed.\n5. January 4, 2023 [v3 branch] we sync from master, the refund fix is updated in the DAO V2 file, but we are focused on V3 and do not examine the merge carefully and miss the opportunity to copy the fix into V3.\n6. January 11, 2023 [v3 branch] we split DAO V3 into library files to overcome the contract size limit; this change makes the bug harder to discover, as we lose the ability to directly compare V3 to V2 line for line, as we still could have done between V2 and V1.\n\nAnother problem was that we did not copy or change all V1/V2 tests to test V3; most of the tests were copied to run on V3 as well, but we dropped the ball on the gas refund test.\n\n## How we’re preventing it from happening again\n\n1. Make sure tests are always running against the latest version.\n2. When merging a fix to master, make sure to correctly merge it into any open branch.\n\nRunning all tests on the latest version is the most important takeaway. As part of working on this fix we made sure all DAO tests are now running on the latest version, and removed old duplicate tests that were testing older versions. We believe we’ve reduced the chances of this happening again significantly.\n\nThe second point is helpful as an extra layer of safety, mostly helpful if we don’t have sufficient tests or failed to run all tests against the latest version we’re working on.

We contend that despite the existence of various sub-DAOs, none of them are exclusively dedicated to cultivating the connections and inspiration vital for artists to actively and substantially engage in the Nouns ecosystem. Few subcommunity initiatives manage to captivate the interest of potential new members. The insights from esteemed artists, whom we deeply respect, have contributed to the prominence of several communities and projects. We aim to bring this prominence to Nouns while emphasizing the priority of advancing digital art.\n\n## Overview\n\nDigital art currently finds itself diminished in the broader artistic discourse, prompting our dedication to effecting change in this scenario. We aspire to propel digital art to a pervasive state. The establishment of the Mesmer: A Nouns Council for the Digital Arts emerges as a strategic initiative designed to cultivate widespread appreciation for digital art, fostering education and adoption on a global scale as we support the artists behind it.\n\n*“We're fortunate to have an exceptional team, and together within Nouns Community we're poised to create a lasting legacy in the history of digital art.”*\n\n## Team\n\n*The concept behind the concept*\n\n\"So I said 'What if we created something very provocative? A sanctuary for artists, but in its broadest interpretation, also a work of art, a creation, and a catalyst for meaningful discourse.\nWhat degree of intrigue generated by anonymity can truly be leveraged as a potent tool? What is the equilibrium of anonymity? Satoshi Nakamoto's execution in this regard was remarkable.\"\n\n**Note:** The project's creators have chosen to maintain their anonymity, prioritizing a focus on the project's message and artistic vision rather than individual recognition.\n\n**Advisors Description;**\nLeaders of the art community, tastemakers, builders, advisors, critics, curators, community supporters and industry art partners.\n\n• [Noah](https://x.com/cryptopunknoah)\nPrev Brand Lead [CryptoPunks](https://x.com/cryptopunksnfts) and Contemporary Art Specialist [Christie’s](https://twitter.com/christiesinc) & Founder and Artist [Howlerz](https://x.com/howlerznft)\n\n• [Alejandro Cartagena](https://twitter.com/halecar2)\nCo-founder and Artist of [Fellowship](https://x.com/fellowshiptrust) & [Obscura](https://x.com/obscuradao).

Patrick initially started as a traditional painter and transitioned to digital art around 2012. He gained recognition for manipulating image files of paintings and photographs, creating captivating animated loops. Patrick is an incredibly influential and powerful voice in the art world.\n\n**Curators Description;**\n\n• [Micol](https://x.com/micolmicolmicol)\nFounder of [Verticalcrypto](https://x.com/verticalcrypto)\n\n• [Sofia Garcia](https://x.com/sofiagarcia_io)\nFounder [ARTXCODE](https://x.com/artxcode_io) & [Board Code](https://x.com/codeartorg)/[Art and Art Blocks](https://x.com/artblocks_io)\n\n## Movement\n\nAt the heart of this movement is art, a robust network that isn't assessed by the sheer quantity of connections but by the depth and quality of those connections. It places a premium on authenticity over superficiality, sincerity over pretense, and genuine engagement over mere presence.\n\nSolid networking within the artistic community recognizes the power of reciprocity, where giving and contributing to your network leads to receiving in return. It nurtures a sense of community where individuals support each other's aspirations, exchange ideas, and create opportunities. This movement is grounded in that when one artist prospers, the entire network reaps the benefits.\n\nThe Mesmer extends its influence across various domains. In the realm of knowledge, it fuels innovation and sparks fresh collaborative dialogues. In the world of arts, it propels the creation of innovative works through interdisciplinary partnerships.\n\nThis movement transcends the pursuit of extensive proliferation; it's about valuing quality and the long term, stability over flux, unity over division. It's about the enchantment that blossoms when diverse minds come together to pursue shared objectives.\n\nAs we navigate this digital age, the Mesmer serves as a reminder that art embodies an authentic movement and the most robust foundation for connections. It underscores the enduring value of impactful, long-term construction. In a world teeming with artists, this movement upholds the notion that art serves as both the point of origin and the ultimate destination, the bedrock of our triumph and contentment.\n\n## Rationale\n\nFinance a program/council that establishes a foundation for other projects with the aim of promoting art and providing a secure space for artists and digital art. (1) aesthetic diversification beyond the illustrative premise, (2) create a culture where the meme is implemented and placed in solid proliferation.\n\n*“What moves men of genius, or rather what inspires their work, is not new ideas, but their obsession with the idea that what has already been said is still not enough.”*\n\\- Eugene Delacroix\n\n## Aesthetic diversification beyond the illustrative premise\n\nThe world of digital art is currently undergoing a significant and innovative transformation. At its core lies the meme – a seemingly straightforward yet incredibly adaptable form of cultural expression. It appears as a flaw to me that the art within Nouns is predominantly characterized by an illustrative premise or animations. Memes are inherently multifaceted, effortlessly adjusting to diverse cultural contexts, languages, and trends. As such, the meme stands as an artistic formula that transcends boundaries, championing inclusivity and encouraging artists from various backgrounds to engage.\n\n*“I really appreciate the idea of Nouns pushing into different art styles.”*\n\\- [willpapper](https://twitter.com/willpapper) (nouner)\n\n*“i'm generally here for us diversifying the way nouns shows up”*\n\\- [Jesse Pollak](https://twitter.com/jessepollak) (nouner)\n\n*“I think showing the diversity of nouns brand to go beyond cute characters”*\n\\- [brennen](https://twitter.com/brennen_eth) (nouner)\n\n\\- Case study: Sensuality in Art\n\nOn the heels of [Prop 392’s](https://nouns.wtf/vote/392) The theme of sensuality, chosen for its delicate nature, served as a canvas for interpretation and became the subject of data research to understand the meme's applicability and the community's perspective on such sensitivity.\n\n“It is highly gratifying to witness the execution of the initial objective and the impact it generated, similar to major discussions such as fork and burn, the community's interest and the division of opinions regarding nounish applications in art is remarkable. The feedback provided, along with the articles published, has been deeply valued and considered in shaping our overall narrative. We have read each one with great appreciation.”\n\n## A culture where the meme is implemented and placed in solid proliferation\n\n***A monthly grant for digital art. Supports 12 Artists for 6 months, and the artist gets the prestige of being in the program. (This results in a total support of $50,000 for each artist.)***\n\n- Abstract Operational Process for monthly grant:\n\nWith the assistance of our curators, a careful selection will be made of the 12 most exceptional and inventive artists who could have nounish inspirations. These artists are anticipated to create and interpret nouns in the most unique way according to their individual artistic visions. They will produce pieces within their respective domains of art, leading to a grand exhibition at the program's conclusion.\n\n*“I'm eager to see which artists will be selected. Personally, I'm a big fan of [XCOPY](https://twitter.com/XCOPYART), and I'd be thrilled to witness one of his unique pieces inspired by Nounish.”*\n\n- Educational Opportunities:\n\nThe program establishes an educational pathway, offering workshops and outreach initiatives that enable artists to impart their expertise and skills to the wider community. Distinguished guests also bring valuable knowledge to the artists. Spaces with guests and other artists will be held every 15 days.\n\n*“Art prevails over the artists who create it and the initiatives that sustain this ecosystem, daring to experiment extensively. While I may not possess knowledge about Nouns or NFTs, but I do have some well-formed ideas about the digital art movement that I can share. I'm here for anything you need.”*\n\\- Anne Laure ( Director Department of Externals Affairs - Musée du Louvre )\n\n***Nounish Friday (Weekly Artistic Celebration): Every week we acquire $2,000 of art nounish.***\n\n- Abstract Operational Process for Nounish Friday:\n\nEvery Friday for six months we will announce on our twitter profile that we are selecting 3 pieces to add to the Nounish Art Vault. Each week, we will invite nouners, notable personalities, esteemed collectors, artists, critics and external guests to participate as our weekly curators. These people will have the privilege of choosing the works of the week and giving a few words about their selections, which will be published on profile every Sunday along with the chosen works.\n\nThis process represents a double honor for the artist: his creation shines under the unique choices made by our illustrious guests. The featured artists of the week will receive a guaranteed financial incentive through the selected pieces.\n\n- Specifications:\n\nThe Nounish Art Vault serves as a safe place where all pieces collected in Nounish Friday will be housed. This way, after the implementation of this program, we will have a vast and varied collection that can be utilized by other nounish projects, exhibitions, and in-person events organized by other builders.\n\n---\n\n## Benefit to NounsDAO Ecosystem\n#\n- **Future support of the artists from the team**\n\nBeyond the contours of a grant program, our commitment resonates on a profound level. The individuals steering this project are not just advisors and curators; they are visionaries, founders deeply ingrained in the art space. These are individuals with their own projects, daily immersed in supporting artists and various programs. Encountering such an opportunity aligns seamlessly with our beliefs and identity. It transcends the soul of grant programs, extending into a space of rich experience, extensive networking, and coveted access—traits cultivated over years at the heart of the art scene, by our team members.\n\nOur involvement goes beyond the grant phase; it's a pledge to personally invest in sustaining the cultural relevance of this project. It involves channeling collective efforts to secure strong collectors, galleries, museums and aspire for inclusion in esteemed institutional collections. As [exemplified by Alejandro's fellowship program](https://x.com/halecar2/status/1718789945857298785), where works found a home at [MOMA](https://twitter.com/MuseumModernArt). We are resolute in our dedication to ensure these works endure as culturally significant entities in the ever-evolving landscape of digital art, etching a lasting presence in the zeitgeist of our space.\n\n\n*Notes:* To start a grant program based on the productions of new art works permits a creation of a legacy. There will be possibilities to create stories, with NOUNS at the center of it, of the different generations that have passed through the program, the interconnections between the different artworks created in the program, the life changing opportunities that the grant will mean to the artists. The life of the grant lives on in all places where these artworks created during the grant period circulate in the artworld. When placed in museums, when collected, when awards are won; all these future moments will be opportunities for the NOUNS brand to proliferate to new places and new eyes.\n\n- **Expansion of Interest/New Members for Nouns: Collectors are to artists they resonate with, as artists are to the art they create.**\n\nIn one of our researches aligned with the created thesis, the current population of art collectors predominantly has [cryptopunks](https://twitter.com/cryptopunksnfts) in their portfolio, actively interacting with them, in addition, a significant portion of collectors express interest in any group or project that supports artists and can potentially become part of such a community.\n\nA substantial number of collectors have a comprehensive understanding of what Nouns represent, and a considerable percentage of them express disinterest because the artists in their collections are not part of such a community, this profile reflects collectors in general. Notably, there is a significant correlation between collectors participating in projects and the frequency with which artists mention them, resulting in higher levels of interactions within the space overall.\n\nEvery collector fondly remembers the initial piece they acquired, although the meaning of that first purchase is different. Many collectors make their first purchase after hearing mentions of specific projects from other collectors and artists. For a significant portion of collectors, the first piece obtained provided them access to a community that aligns with their visions and expectations of artists.\n\n\n*“I love nouns and loved what [Dustin Yellin](https://twitter.com/dustinyellin) x [Artmatr](https://twitter.com/artmatrco). I'm watching what's happening and seeing how it overall affects the community and market.”*\n\\- [Sebastian](https://twitter.com/sebastianss527) (Digital Art at [Christie’s](https://twitter.com/christiesinc))\n\n\nIn the panorama of Nouns and its ongoing projects, a notable gap becomes evident – the absence of initiatives specifically crafted to attract new members. While other developers prioritize proliferation, they fall short on projects tailored to a broader audience that significantly lacks the funds necessary to become a nouner. This observation carries particular weight when considering the broader view that the Ethereum injection brought by new members is a key factor for sustaining activation projects and proliferations to other audiences. This shift in focus considers a niche audience not commonly found at broad events or activations but existing within small communities of collectors, founders, and creators. The common thread uniting these groups is a shared appreciation for art, in essence, collectors who hold funds for such allocations.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/UWJKvmI.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/f9MJMAP.jpg)\n*CryptoPunk #110 Centre Pompidou Museum, Paris*\n\n*Notes:* To have this program be successful will open the possibility of a new generation of possible nouners with philanthropic pursuits to join the community. The program is a permanent promotional tool of the NOUNS values through the artists they support. The organic nature of how this works makes for the best advocacy program ever.\n\n- **Impact on the Nouns Brand**\n\nIn a long-term perspective, envisioning that with the execution of this project, Nouns can serve as an exemplary patron for all other projects in the space. It's a visualization possibility that can be considered a \"moment in history.\"\n\n\nWhen contemplating the team involved in this proposal, the depth of experience each member possesses within the art space presents the opportunity to craft distinct narratives. For instance, envisioning a Noun being regarded as a piece of art, displayed in a museum, becomes a plausible prospect. This possibility echoes what was achieved with Cryptopunk at the ICA Museum. The pivotal aspect here is that this project allows for the creation of a narrative, sparking interest and establishing a profound presence within the art space. In the long-term execution, the Nouns brand is cultivated within this narrative.\n\nA recent contemplation revolves around the fact that, despite the remarkable characteristics of Nouns, they are not commonly perceived as works of art. It's an unexplored visualization, which may explain the absence of discussions about Prints among Noun collectors. Nouns Prints are not something they currently visualize adding to the walls of their homes.\n\n**In general terms, we should consider this for conceptual and value structure:**\n\nOne of the things that can also be very attractive to NOUNS and to artists is a framework. What type of conceptual parameters will be explored in the program? Think of this like if you were to join a computer learning program. You would be expected to explore freely but have all work circle back to the core values of computer learning. So to land this in the NOUNS, we need to ask:\n\nWhat are NOUNS conceptually?\nWhat are NOUNS aesthetically?\nWhat are NOUNS in the context of generative art and the history of art?\n\n*For me, the general answers are around these ideas or values:*\n\n-Randomization\n-Collage\n-Seriality\n-Generative art\n-Community\n\nSo in that sense, we build the open call based on those values. It is open to all art practices, but we are looking for artists who want to a)continue to explore these values they already have in their art or b)artists who are interested in exploring their art in the context of these values.\n\nBy doing so, we are creating NOUNS art. Art that is in line with the values of NOUNS. This creates two effects: it validates NOUNS as art and makes these values cross-pollinate with other art forms that may have never considered these values (cinema, video, photography etc). \n\nThough this might seem limiting, it is actually value-centered. Parameters for artists are important and will filter from the start those artists who are willing to commit and expand their vision and welcome those who are interested in the NOUNS values.\n\n---\n\n## Program Organization\n\n1- Open call\n2- Mentorship\n3- Artist conversations\n4- Artist presentations\n5- Monthly work reviews\n\n**Operational Process Breakdown**\n\n1- Open call\n\n*How will we conduct the Open Call for the artist grant?*\n\n- **Awareness:**\n   - 4-week submission timeline\n   - Social media campaign\n   - Weekly Twitter and Instagram posts from all team members + friends with instructions for open-call submissions\n   - @NounsDAO account repost\n   - Strategic 1:1 outreach to artists and communities for encouragement to apply\n   - Weekly public discussions (Twitter spaces, Discord) to answer any questions about the grant and program\n\n- **Application Process**\n   - Define submission dates i.e. December 1, 2023 - December 31, 2023\n   - Create a micro-site that provides concrete instructions for artists to submit proposals and perhaps outlines the project a bit more (who the team is, timeline, and further project details)\n   - Set up a dedicated e-mail address for the submissions\n   - Curators review applications and determine a shortlist of artists for review with the larger team\n   - Weekly meetings with the team to review artist selections throughout the open-call process\n\n- **Example Artist submission form:**\n\n  - Basic info - name, location, social handles\n  - Proposed project overview\n  - Portfolio of 1 or 2 past projects (this is a great filter to see if they have a sense of their artistry)\n  - How do you plan on using the funds to realize the project?\n  - Project Timeline\n  - How the proposal reflects the ethos of the Nouns community\n  - Any other key information i.e.\n      - One (or a few) of the works created will be stored in the Nouns art collection vault\n      - Minimum requirement of works to be created \n\n- **We need to create phases in the process:**\n \n   - Administrative: Applications not complying with the solicited materials get discarded for fairness to all other that do\n   - Review: We all review independently the applications and we can create a simple voting system of 1-5. Best scored projects go to the next phase\n   - Group review: Sessions to advocate for and elucidate projects that we perceive as robust. The final selection of candidates should occur here. -Financial review. We need to come to a consensus about the monetary allocation for each project accepted\n\n*How will we select the artists?*\n\n- **Selection Criteria**\n\n   - Portfolio assessment: artist practice, background, body of work, past work \n   - Dedication to grant application / project: assess how invested the artist is in participating in the project with the quality of the answers in the open call \n   - Project assessment based on:\n      \\- Technical \n      \\- Idea \n      \\- Feasibility \n      \\- Impact on Nouns brand and community \n      \\- Future application (consider the longevity of the project)\n      \\- Resonance with the wider art ecosystem (will it resonate with the audience we are going for?)\n   - Artist profile: where to they come from (we want to be inclusive and build a global program but at the same time due due diligence on the applicants) \n\n- **Things to consider:**\n\n   - Tiered funding approach based on project ambitions?\n   - Tier: “New Voices” for emerging artists. It could be a range (From $$ to $$$)\n   - Tier: “Projects” for working artists with trajectory. Also with a range. \n\nRange permits us to individually value the scope of the project and not over allocate resources to projects that do not require so many funds.\n\nCreate a “cancel of the grant” clause in the open call. I´ve been part of many grant programs and I´ve felt that the ones that have that option tend to have more committed artists. Artists can get entangled and not produce work and for us as a program, would be damaging. Every artist should deliver a project at the end of the grant period. This is absolutely necessary for our longevity.\n\n2- Mentorship phase. \n\nIn this phase the artists that have passed through to be part of the program will have a 1-1 meeting to brainstorm with all curators and advisors. This is needed so that each artist will have a connection and a broad range of reactions to their proposed projects.\n\n3- Artists Conversation\n\nWe invite artists to do group zoom presentations with all the artists. These artists will present their work and motivate the grant artists through how they talk about their creative process, how they build their projects and how they navigate the life of being an artist. We should have at least one a month. These are moments to motivate the artist. The artists we bring should be charismatic and enthusiastic in order to convey their message.\n\n4- Artist presentations\n\nThere should be at three group presentations via zoom where the artists present their projects. One should be at the start of the grant, in the conceptual phase where the projects ar just ideas, a second at the middle of the grant to show the advances of the proposal and the last one as a conclusion of the project. These presentations should motivate the artists to work as they will have to be public about what they are doing and how much effort and proof of work they have for the grant and support they are receiving.\n\n5- Monthly work reviews\n\nEach artist should have a monthly 1-1 meeting with the curators in order to receive concise feedback to the work they are doing. The curator should receive the work previous to the meeting in order to bring to the meeting strong feedback that will help the artist in their pursuit.\n\n---\n\n## CC0\n\nWe will take the initiative to acquaint artists with the significance of CC0, enabling them to decide whether their pieces will be made available under this license or not.\n\nWe hold a shared viewpoint regarding the significance of CC0 for all projects within nouns. However, we acknowledge that each artist may have a distinct perspective on this matter. This is why we opt to offer them a comprehensive introduction to the subject and grant them the autonomy to decide how it applies to their work.\n\n## Transparency\n\nAll funds will be transparently deposited and utilized through the multisig that governs the Mesmer.\n\nIn total, we have five signatories: Two advisors, a trusted nouner, the project sponsor (who is also a nouner), and one of the project's creators.\n\n**Signatories:**\n[Brennen](https://twitter.com/brennen_eth)\n[Alejandro](https://twitter.com/halecar2)\n[Noah](https://twitter.com/cryptopunknoah)\n[Bigint](https://twitter.com/0xbigint)\nProject Creator\n\n***\n\n## Overall Cost\n\n$1,396,000 USDC\n\n*Budget Breakdown*\n\n**Artistry Spotlight - $654,000**\n- A monthly grant for Digital Art.\n$50k x 12 (6 months, each grant totals $50k per artists/ distributed in that period) - $600k\n- Nounish Friday\n$2k x 27 (3 pieces per week/ 6 months/ 27 Fridays) - $54k\n\n**Strategic Vision $553k / 8 months**\n\n- *Advisors Fees - $352k ($11000 per advisor / per month)*\n\n  - Feedback and evaluation\n  - Communication and targeting\n  - Creative oversight\n\n- *Curators Fees - $128k ($8000 per curator / per month)*\n\n  - Curation and relationship with artists\n  - Overseeing and managing\n  - Acquisitions and Deaccessioning\n  - Collection Management and Documentation\n\n- *Strategic guest fees - $40k ($5000k per month)*\n\n  - Communication traction\n  - Organic number planning\n  - Feedback and evaluation\n\n- *Community Manager fees - $33k ($4125k per month)*\n\n  - Engagement and Moderation\n  - Feedback Gathering\n  - Community Building\n\n**Management - $0k / 8 months**\n\nAs creators and founders, we have opted to forgo the budget initially earmarked for our compensation/project management fees. This choice places a significant emphasis on the message and strengthens the artistic vision of the project, prioritizing it over individual recognition. \n\nNevertheless, we propose that a portion of the budget designated for us be redirected towards the production of a concise 15-minute documentary.\n\n- *Production and execution of the short documentary - 80K*\n\n  - Production of a 15-minute video that is highly engaging, enabling each of us to discuss our accomplishments during the program in detail.

I think given the fact that Nouns holds substantial funds (+their reach and reputation within the community) it would be a great way to support artists, and art, with its substantial number of collectors, contributes to the Nouns ecosystem.

One key factor to bear in mind is the delicate balance between financial support and the prestige associated with participation. These two elements often intertwine to make such programs successful. Therefore, it is essential to recognize that artists, at various stages of their careers, have distinct needs when it comes to funding and recognition.\n\nFor emerging artists who are just beginning their journey, the appeal of participation and the prestige it brings can be more critical than receiving substantial funding. Their participation adds a sense of freshness and vitality to the program, contributing to its overall appeal. This synergy benefits both the emerging artists and the program itself, creating a dynamic and mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, more established artists may require a more substantial financial injection into their projects. These artists often carry ambitious visions that necessitate a greater level of funding. Their involvement brings a wealth of experience and influence to the program, further enhancing its reputation.\n\nAs we consider the program's structure, it is prudent to adopt a tiered system of support that caters to the diverse needs of artists. Such a model should not only address the artists' requirements but also leverage the network effect. The network effect relies on the concept that having fewer established artists can generate significant prestige for the program, while having a larger number of emerging artists strengthens the perception of the program as a staunch supporter of the arts.\n\nIn our perspective, a balanced distribution that favors a higher number of emerging artists can serve as a robust and equitable model. It bolsters the emergence of fresh talent and ensures a steady influx of innovative ideas. Simultaneously, it can leverage the prestige generated by established artists to further enhance the program's reputation and reach.\n\nThis project should aim to find the equilibrium between these elements, fostering an environment where emerging and established artists can coexist and thrive. By recognizing the distinct funding and prestige requirements at various career stages, we can create a program that resonates with both artists and the broader artistic community, ultimately enhancing the vibrancy and sustainability of the arts.\n\n## What comes next?\n\nUpon the program's completion, we will draft a new proposal for the main event, extending an invitation to the entire NFT community to experience the artworks of the 12 selected artists. This proposal will outline the event's execution.\n\nIn the future, following the completion of this program, we aspire to delve deeper into the narrative. We plan to create a documentary about the selected artists, exploring their backgrounds, inspirations, and gathering their thoughts on the experience of being part of this program. “Mesmer: The Council\" will be a 12-part documentary, with each episode dedicated to the story of one of the artists featured in the program.\n\nOur concept of art is deeply entwined with individual identity, a driving force behind much of cultural enthusiasm. In this endeavor, we aim to expand and emphasize the influence of personal history. While there is a wealth of knowledge about the artist's work, we seek to uncover the person behind these creations. What inspires them, and what is their creative process like? What is their life story?\n\n\"Mesmer: The Council\" is a unique exploration of creativity. By delving into each artist's identity and artistic journey, we hope to uncover something more profound. This involves masterfully navigating the intricacies of their craft while staying connected to universal themes through a personal perspective. It's quite remarkable to consider how humans have transformed art into an extension of the revolutionary essence of life, and art into an extension of technology.\n\n***\n\nWe extend a gracious invitation for you to consider listening to the recording of our conversation with Brennen, Toady Hawk, and Joshua Fisher on Talking Props.

What is the progress of prop ‘X’? Why hasn't the prop ‘Y’ team shared the bi-weekly updates they promised? What difficulties are the developers of prop ‘Z’ facing that require more time? How much return did prop “V” generate for the treasury?*\n\nThese are just some of the questions that often arise before and after the decision-making process in Nouns community. While we have funded numerous groundbreaking proposals since the DAO’s inception (such as Budweiser Super Bowl ad, the Rose Parade, Nouns E-sports) we’ve also encountered projects trying to take advantage of the DAO and it’s funds as well as builders that raised concerns within the community by not communicating effectively during the development phase.\n\nEven though we have many Nounish data dashboards and tools, we’ve realised that the tracking and evaluation process of funded proposals is not as efficient as it should. Additionally, solely relying on builders to submit reports voluntarily is not effective, leading to suboptimal results. What we lack is a bridge that fills the transparency gap between funded projects and the community.\n\nWe need to establish a set of proposal tracking and evaluation standards based on data, maintain regular communication with funded projects to encourage accountability throughout the community and have a place where all those info are available to everyone 24/7.\n\n![1](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJKfcxiVa.jpg)\n\n\n# **How?**\nWe’re proposing to establish ThePASS team (the team behind a prominent [DAO aggregator](https://thepass.to/) and [analytical](https://dune.com/thepass) platform) as an accountability third-party service to keep track of each funded project progress by:\n\n**[1]** analyzing the progress of funded proposals by creating a comprehensive evaluation and accountability system\n**[2]** regularly communicating with builders to ensure proposal progress\n**[3]** archiving project updates and compile them into monthly reports\n**[4]** hosting monthly Nounish Townhalls where builders, community and special guests discuss the progress of funded props\n\n![4](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkl7oejE6.png)\n\n\nThis approach offers several benefits such as:\n* Insights to the building process of funded projects\n* Solid data we can refer to in future decision-making\n* Recognition to the best builders\n* Attract new contributors and investors\n\n***We’re not aiming to be another proposal updates platform but the “bridge” between builders and the community ⌐◨-◨***\n\n# **Execution**\n\n**[1] Evaluation system/Proposal Analysis**\n\nHaving a standard evaluation system ensures fairness and objectivity in the evaluation process as well as helps with accurate measurement, boosts transparency, and assists in making more informed decisions thanks to data.\n\nWe have established a ‘Measurements Standard’ with specific criteria based on project types. This standard will serve as the foundation for our proposal analysis, ensuring consistency and transparency in our assessments.\n\n![2](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJpYjliEp.jpg)\n\n\n*The tracking progress will initiate upon the successful funding of this proposal*\n\nOur team specialises in data aggregation and tracking so even if funded proposals number scales up, collecting and organizing those data will not be a problem.\n\nWe will keep track of on-chain data and social media updates (X, Discord, updates.wtf etc.) as well as engage in direct conversations with projects to provide you the most accurate metrics.\n\n**[2] Communicating with Builders**\n\nTo ensure everything is running smoothly, we will actively engage in group conversations with funded projects, starting from proposal execution to proposal delivery.\n\nThis will assist in:\n\n* Getting real-time updates directly from builders\n* Making sure proposal phases and goals are met\n* Identifying and reporting potential risks (delays, budget overruns, technical difficulties)\n\n**[3] Monthly Proposal Updates Website/Report**\n\nThePASS team will build a dedicated Nounish project archive website consisting of 2 seperate sections :\n1. ***Projects:*** Dedicated section to project updates coming directly from builders and our team’s data tracking efforts\n2. ***Monthly reports:*** Monthly proposal update reports section, ensuring easy access to the community\n\nAbout monthly reports, we will compile **[1]** Evaluation system/Proposal Analysis and **[2]** builder updates into an easy-to-read yet comprehensive monthly report, post it on the website and share it across different platforms such as X, Discord etc. to ensure maximum visibility.\n\nBy providing monthly reports to the community we aim to:\n* Bridge the “updates” gap between builders and the community\n* Enhance transparency and accountability within Nouns ecosystem\n* Boost builders reputation and project adoption\n* Have all current and past proposal updates info voters and the community needs in one place\n\n***Check our Treasury Report for ApeCoin DAO as a reference of our work: [Apecoin DAO Treasury Report](https://thepass.to/apedao/ape-dao-2023-may-treasury-report.pdf)***\n\n**[4] Monthly Townhalls**\n\nWe will host monthly Townhall meetings and invite funded projects, core members, DAO experts, and media observers to engage in open discussions about funded projects, address community feedback and talk about the overall health of the DAO.\n\nIn each Townhall we will invite at least 2 media observers as guests, 1 DAO expert, and builders featured in the last monthly report. As far as attendees, our goal is to have at least 50 in each Townhall.\n\n# Goals, Deliverables & Timelines\n**Goals**\n\nBy handling the proposal tracking and reporting tasks in an experienced team we solve the ‘builders-community updates gap’ Nouns DAO faces drastically and directly. Community will know where and when they are going to get their proposal updates as well as where to look for past funded proposals info and builders will have to provide those updates to maintain the community's support and trust.\n\nHosting monthly Townhalls will boost community engagement by enabling direct interaction with builders as well as highlight exceptional teams and individuals. On top of that by inviting special guests we make sure projects gain more exposure outside Nouns ecosystem which will help in attracting new builders and investors.\n\n**Deliverables (6 months)**\n* Nouns Proposal Reports archive website\n* 6x Monthly Proposal Reports\n* 6x Townhalls\n\n**Timelines**\n\n* Month 1: Commense website building, Monthly Report #1 , Townhall #1\n* Month 2: Website Building, Monthly Report #2 , Townhall #2\n* Month 3: Website Release, Monthly Report #3 , Townhall #3\n* Month 4: Monthly Report #4 , Townhall #6\n* Month 5: Monthly Report #5 , Townhall #6\n* Month 6: Monthly Report #6 , Townhall #6![3](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1kV0ljVa.jpg)\n\n\n# Funding\nWe are requesting 26 ETH in total for 6 months of operations.
