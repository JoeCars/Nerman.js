bit more context for others to evaluate this proposal. \nWhen thinking about Line, i would easily place them in the top 1% of all animation industry if not even higher. Their work is sublime and overall inspiring for many schools of animators who look upto them. \n\nNouns have funded PG in the past in spirit of supporting the core itself: Ethereum. There was an interesting critique last time around where people rightfully mentioned, \"oh how does this proliferate nouns meme more meaningfully alongside supporting PG?\".\n\nThis is an evolution on that ask \n- This prop specifically stay inside the bounds of the previous proposal ask but instead goes the route of creating media that a) proliferate the meme b) use the media to then support PG instead. \n\nBut can this proliferate the meme?\nIf you haven't seen already, Line made the elementals story for Azuki which was the talk of the town for a while. That alone garnered tens of millions of impressions across the board inside AND outside traditional NFT cohort. \n\nBest case scenario outcome\n- Incredible piece of media generated that builds intrigue in the minds of the viewer.\n- Media meaningfully generates funding for PG by casting a wide net from the Droposal. \n\n--\nP.S.

So we have been focused on building a world people can fall in love with, characters with depth and relatability. \n\n- We will ramp up on discussions post EP2 once we have enough footage sizzle to show off to partners + enough production budget from the DAO to take the story much further along.\n\n- Distributors are also excited when there is enough fan support around a story, that is part of the reason why we created a casting call for EP2 to bring more communities (and by extension more fans) into the fold.\n\n- You might have noticed 'quack' on instagram growing slowly an independent fanbase as well. That character is our 'minion' moment in story where he will be integrated into the story to gradually bring an audience over from an outward looking perspective. Alongside 'Quack', a few more will be created and are our angle to organically blast off the storyworld when the story is further along.  \n\n--\nOn funding:\nAnimated features are hard to make.
