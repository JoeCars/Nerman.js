The Nouns in Rio team is requesting **9 ETH + 9,500 USDC** to create an engaging Prop House Experience in a hub brimming with innovators.\n‚Äé \n## How üëÄ\n\nWe plan to create a round in the upcoming Nouns in Rio House and open exclusively* to all [Blockchain Rio](https://blockchainfestival.io/) attendees, a place full of builders aspiring to build for the Web3 ecosystem and push the boundaries of innovation.\n\nA pool of 7 ETH will be designated to back 20 projects, each set to receive 0.35 ETH. Proposals must aim to enhance Prop House in some way, whether through community integration, explainer videos, code development, and more. After the event, Nouners will have a one-week voting window to determine which projects get funded.\n\n**During the event, we'll ask builders interested in submitting a proposal to fill out a form. This ensures that all proposals come from verified event participants.*\n‚Äé \n![](https://i.imgur.com/8kR9fgd.png)  \n‚Äé \n## Why ü§î\n\nWe want individuals to recognize Prop House as a platform where they can get funding to bring their ideas to life. By showcasing the diverse groups already benefiting from the platform, we aim to inspire them to consider how they can engage their own communities in similar ways.\n\nThe true value of this experience lies not only in funding individual projects but also in connecting talented builders to the Nouns DAO community. By cultivating this relationship, we create a pathway for ongoing collaboration and innovation, encouraging them to continue contributing to and growing with the community.\n\nCheck out all the amazing things that have come from Prop House. **Nouns has funded one of the best Web3 platforms, and it's high time we spread the word about it.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AZR3Lfp.png)\n‚Äé \n## Where üìç\n\nWe discovered Prop House at an event and from that moment we knew we wanted to create an IRL experience for it. Now, we have the perfect chance. We'll be at the largest Web3 & Business event in Latin America, [Blockchain Rio](https://blockchainfestival.io/), from September 12th to 14th, alongside big names like Polkadot, CoinEx, Polygon, Ledger, and more. It's the ideal place to find passionate builders and introduce them to Prop House.\n\nTake a look at the first edition of the event from 2022, which attracted more than 22,000 visitors, featured 432 speakers, and generated 86 million reais in economic impact for the state of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/CODwQjS.gif)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/l3gsmny.png)\n\n*Brazilian builders on stage talking about Nouns and Prop House. [Watch here!](https://twitter.com/blockchain_rio/status/1630946236105736195)* \n‚Äé \n## Lounge üõãÔ∏è\n\nOur lounge will include two interactive totems that enable attendees to explore Prop House and toggle between different houses and rounds. Additionally, two large TVs will display a video produced by us, highlighting projects funded by various communities through Prop House. The lounge backdrop will offer step-by-step instructions, complete with a QR code, for submitting proposals.\n\nAll of this will support the team in explaining what Prop House is and how it works. We'll also **give a talk** at the event and invite people to join the experience and submit their projects.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ut98dfj.png)\n\n*The layout of the lounge and the art on the backdrop are for illustrative purposes and may not represent the final design.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UNfxWZG.png)\n‚Äé \n## Team ü§ù\n\n[Nouns in Rio](https://twitter.com/NounsInRio) team, represented by [JP](https://twitter.com/home) and [Debinvest](https://twitter.com/debinvest), is behind the project. They will be on-site at the lounge to explain Prop House, discuss the round, and assist with wallet creations and proposal submissions.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9mp1CbE.png)\n\nNouns in Rio team has successfully organized various nounish IRL events, including [Nouns Week](https://nounsweek.wtf/rio-de-janeiro/), the [Treasure Hunt](https://twitter.com/NounsInRio/status/1574418495911219201), [social actions](https://twitter.com/NounsInRio/status/1606765831064588288) for Prop House's Nounish Holidays and many others.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WDTRnam.png)\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/uFXRkNX.gif)\n\n*Nouns Week*\n‚Äé \n## Budget üí∞\n\nWith 7 ETH, we can fund a diverse range of projects with a meaningful ETH value. JP and Debinvest will each receive 1 ETH for managing the project and staffing the lounge during the event. The cost for setting up and operating the event space, which includes event fees and production expenses, will be 9,500 USDC. In case fewer than 20 proposals are submitted, **all remaining ETH will be returned to the DAO.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HqGnVgI.png)\n‚Äé \n## Success ‚ú®\n\nAfter the event concludes, we'll provide the DAO with both an aftermovie and a detailed report. This report will feature key metrics like site visits during the event (provided by the Prop House team if possible), submitted proposals, QR code scans, and minted POAPs. We'll also extend an invitation to all funded project leads to join the [Nouns in Rio Discord server](https://discord.gg/yBFRt2D894) for ongoing project follow-up, ensuring sustained engagement and support.\n\nTo amplify our impact, we'll actively engage the community through our Portuguese Nounish channels like [@nounsinrio](instagram.com/nounsinrio), [@nounsbr](instagram.com/nounsbr) and [@thenounsquarebr](https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquarebr). The engagement metrics from these channels will be included in our final report.\n\nWe recognize this is a pivotal time for the DAO, but due to the time-sensitive nature of our project, we felt the need to proceed. Thank you for reading and considering this proposal. Let's take Prop House to the streets! üí°\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dAMtste.gif)"},{"blockNumber":18007678,"blockHash":"0x5155ef3de8f6a060374748e4be351cc99dccf88b24695eae684b73fea147a934","transactionIndex":105,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xcd9d8bf04a8655c928cd7400b5140415cabf7b244f5e21e5e08bf56d52b3894e","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":361,"proposer":"0x84044988e0754decAa7444d19c8BF069B977F128","signers":[],"targets":["0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5","0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["withdrawETH()","withdrawPaymentToken()"],"calldatas":["0x","0x"],"startBlock":18043678,"endBlock":18079678,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18007678,"proposalThreshold":2,"quorumVotes":82,"description":"# Withdraw from the TokenBuyer/Payer contracts\n\nThe treasury assets are currently held by the TokenBuyer/Payer contracts are not included in the forking calculation and in the upcoming Proposal 360 there is a ‚àº105 ETH refill for the TokenBuyer/Payer which might cause some disagreement just before a possible fork so I propose to withdraw from the 2 contracts.\n\nThe contracts will refill with the first USDC proposal after this one so it wont cause any issues."},{"blockNumber":18014498,"blockHash":"0xff9d7a3b738a35d4d2153bba023d26762eacc29dea5a3a6954b529e862479bcf","transactionIndex":106,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x88e60afd66016ffc2b45f4a5dc5ba498bb84ae34105cb62dd41d8435eb9b671d","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":362,"proposer":"0xd3e2e76e4Ab0322614fe7aaA3be0B04beD83d0D0","signers":[],"targets":["0x0B789Ef2A2cda2fb5B5c7cdB278C2Cb8BdC96e4C"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":18050498,"endBlock":18086498,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18014498,"proposalThreshold":2,"quorumVotes":82,"description":"# Place Dustin Yellin's Nouns Sculpture at Zero Bond (NYC)\n\nThe DAO recently acquired a Dustin Yellin sculpture (See Proposals 48 and 350).

Movements > Marketing.*\n\nSkateboarding and similar subcultures, despite their rise in popularity, grapple with commercial overreach and value retention. Some of the most pressing challenges include:\n\n1. **Commercial Exploitation**: Outside brands jumping into skateboarding often prioritise profit over authenticity.\n2. **Loss of Authenticity**: Many skaters, due to financial pressures, might promote brands they don't genuinely align with.\n3. **Skater Exploitation**: Many skaters, despite their talent, don't receive fair compensation, especially considering the sport's physical demands.\n4. **Mainstream Misrepresentation**: Media portrayals frequently miss the genuine essence of skateboarding, leaning into stereotypes.\n5. **Skatepark Commercialisation**: Once-communal skateparks are becoming increasingly commercialised.\n6. **Core Values vs. Growth**: Balancing foundational skateboarding values with growth opportunities remains a delicate act.\n\nThe skateboarding domain needs a thoughtful equilibrium. Brands that genuinely get and respect the skate culture have the potential to collaboratively benefit both parties without diluting the sport's spirit.\n\n---\n\n## üí° Proposed Solution\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreiflj5bgctvmzjujul3kvehilbgrzcag7zhomomfdtrtbit4sptjym)\n\nüìù *Check out the [Meier Skatepark renovation](https://www.gnars.wtf/dao/proposals/3) proposal that's currently being delivered*\n\nEmpowering individuals to step into the blockchain world is central to our mission. Shredders, akin to artists, can undergo transformative experiences through this. Our overarching goal is to amplify our influence, simplify operational processes, and champion those with genuine grassroots credibility.\n\n**GNARS** as an acronym crystallizes our ethos, mirroring the Nouns' virtuous cycle, acting as our serendipity machine:\n\n- **Goodwill**: Renewing skateparks and introducing new, shred-worthy sculptures\n- **Network**: Culturally sensitive contributions earn us both visibility and respect\n- **Advocacy**: Harmonising with communities helps us draw in new enthusiasts\n- **Releases**: Collective creative outputs with shared proceeds bolster funding\n- **Serendipity**: Getting onchain empowers shredders, opening fresh avenues\n\n---\n\n## üåü Opportunity\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreihhjrjim3rtjd6k2drh6r5gpy5i7xfp22gjcuouujecd2p4arkxhq)\n\nOur target of onboarding a million shredders might seem lofty, but it's just a fraction - 0.2% - of the 490 million participants in extreme sports.\n\nTo provide some perspective, skateboarding alone boasts 85 million participants.

The Small Grants Committee (later known as NSFW) and Prop House rounds have fueled considerable community contributions, propelling the protocol's momentum. Yet, during the latter half of Nouns Season 2, obtaining small grants grew challenging. Additionally, the continuous management of Prop House Rounds demands consistent coordination.\n\nWe want to help patch this bug in the protocol, and bring back the Builder-forward Nounish Vibes that brought many of us here in the first place.\n\nWe are a trusted group of contributors in the ecosystem who are willing to collectively take on the challenge of running a dynamic and transparent Small Grants Allocation Pod, as well as coordinating and championing a series of exciting biweekly Prop House Rounds over the next six months of Nouns Season 3. \n\n[![s2-noggles.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/W4SHH2bj/s2-noggles.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/SX2dXbMt)\n\n---\n\n## **THE PLAN**\n\n1. Coordinate with the Prop House team to set up two new \"Season 3 Grants\" Infinite Rounds, where anyone in the ecosystem can apply for retroactive funding up to a maximum of 5 ETH or proactive funding up to a maximum of 1 ETH. Our team will review grant applications on a rolling week-by-week basis, with a goal to allocate ~14 ETH per month.  \n2. Coordinate and champion a series of Biweekly Temporal Nouns Prop House Rounds, alternating between Open Grants Rounds and Themed Grants Rounds such as ‚ÄúVisual Arts‚Äù, ‚ÄúKeep Nouns Weird‚Äù, ‚ÄúGaming/Esports‚Äù, ‚ÄúCC0 Music‚Äù, ‚ÄúPublic Goods,‚Äù ‚ÄúMedia and Content,‚Äù etc. We plan to explore various token-voting methods across all the Prop House rounds we run over the next 6 months, engaging the wider nounish community in some cases.\n3. Maintain a [Public-facing Discord](https://discord.gg/qmN4sfsXmh) for community members to ask questions and receive feedback on their applications while also using Prop House‚Äôs built-in comment functionality to provide ongoing transparent, public feedback on builder ideas. \n4. Publish a public monthly summary of funds deployed for full transparency and accountability.\n\n---\n\n## **THE PEOPLE**\n\nFor an important program like this, it is essential to have a team that is 1) Known and Trusted, 2) Knowledgeable and Experienced About the Ecosystem and 3) Reliable at Execution.\n\nThe proposing team has all been active and trusted contributors to Nouns for 1+ years minimum, have an intimate knowledge of the Nouniverse, and have all delivered on past projects.\n\n*Core Team Will Include:*\n* [Al409](https://twitter.com/al409eth)\n* [BradQ](https://twitter.com/iambradq)\n* [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi)\n* [ChrisCoCreated](https://twitter.com/ChrisCoCreated)\n* [Joshua Fisher](https://twitter.com/JoshuaFisher)\n* [Maty](https://twitter.com/matyETH/)\n* [Prof Werder](https://twitter.com/ProfWerder)\n* [Sasquatch](https://twitter.com/PartSasquatch)\n* [SuperTightWoody](https://twitter.com/SuperTightWoody/)\n* [Tha Swami](https://twitter.com/tha_swami) and his daughter [Lil Purple Blueberry](https://twitter.com/lilpurpberry)\n* [Toady Hawk](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk)\n\nTeam will only be compensated based on individual participation via Coordinape rounds every month allocated by participating team members. Funds will be managed in a 3/5 Multisig. \n\n**All decisions on funding will be made by committee vote with a reasonable quorum and never at any one team member‚Äôs sole discretion. Members of the team will not be eligible for funding from either the Infinite Rounds or the S3G Prop House Rounds.**\n\n---\n\n## **THE PRICE**\n\n- Monthly Open & Themed Prop House Rounds: 100 ETH\n- Season 3 Grants Infinite Rounds: 85 ETH\n- Admin/Expenses: 45 ETH \n    - (Admin Expense Ratio: <20%)\n\n---\n\n## **THE PAYOFF**\n\nIt has been quite some time since we have seen the Nouns ecosystem buzzing with the energy of artists and creatives, the insights of talented developers and the vibes of passionate proliferators. \n\nWe will put our reputations on the line and bring our skills and dedication to bear to allocate these DAO funds as effectively and transparently as possible to the most passionate and deserving builders, coders and creatives in the Nouniverse. \n\nRecent Prop House campaigns run by BASE and ThankApe have shown that there are still thousands of builders in the ecosystem, who are hungry for opportunities. \n\n**We don‚Äôt want Nouns to miss out on capturing that

(w)stETH to rETH Treasury Diversification üêÆ\n\n## Description\n\nFollowing the [recent proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320) to test CronFi‚Äôs TWAMM solution for [LST diversification](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10) of Nouns treasury, we at CoW Protocol would like to propose testing execution using our unique batch auction process before proceeding with the full 7k ETH amount. \n\nThere‚Äôs been interest in diversifying¬†[Nouns DAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10), specifically¬†stETH‚ÜírETH. Recently some twitter avatars have [posted](https://twitter.com/0x70626a/status/1684936056443969536) a good analysis of the 500 ETH TWAMM trade, specifically, that the trade resulted in 518.51 rETH received for 500 wstETH (a whopping 1.25% slippage for a stable swap!). We believe CoW Protocol will provide a much more competitive execution price, that is compatible with fair market prices.\n\n## Background\n\nCoW Protocol has been using a multi-token batch auction on Ethereum mainnet for over two years, facilitating [>$27.3B of trading volume](https://dune.com/cowprotocol/cowswap). CoW Protocol uniquely allows its users to get best execution prices even with a lax slippage tolerance thanks to 15 competitive solvers participating in an auction mechanism that protects the users by granting the right to execute the trade to the solver offering maximal price improvement.\n\nCoW Protocol is used by a [number of DAOs](https://cow.fi/daos) for their trading operations including ENS, Aave, Nexus Mutual, Gnosis, Karpatkey, Olympus DAO, Badger DAO, Yearn and more. \n\n## Advantages\n\nCoW Protocol pioneered intent-based trading since its inception in early 2021. This allows users to define order parameters without specifying the actual execution path (`calldata`). Users should expect the most optimised execution route to be chosen by the winning solver at the time of execution. \n\n## Considerations\n\nGiven a sell order of 500 wstETH‚ÜírETH there are several options for order placement that can provide different properties. We'll focus on a *TWAP* order setup although it seems to not be necessary in a smaller 500 ETH trade - the purpose is to demonstrate how a larger order could be set up.\n\nFor a 500 wstETH‚ÜírETH we propose to use a TWAP order of 5 equal parts worth 100 wstETH each. This may result in an execution up to 525 rETH.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJfUbBKo2.png)\n\n### `TWAP` Conditional order\n\n* Launch date: August 17th, 2023. [See twitter post.](https://twitter.com/CoWSwap/status/1692152855694803112?s=20)\n* Transactional volume: ~$4.2M. [See dune query](https://dune.com/cowprotocol/cow-swap-limit-orders-kpis).\n* Value held within `ExtensibleFallbackHandler`-upgraded Safes: ~$12.3M\n\nThe TWAP [implementation](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow) uses a constant limit price across each. Given the stability of wstETH‚ÜírETH, the limit price may be set in advance with a high confidence that this will be representative at the time the proposal is executed (and for the duration of the TWAP).\n\nOrder parameters suggested for this proposal:\n* Limit price: 1 wstETH = 1.038 rETH. This includes 1% slippage tolerance to allow for charging a fee from the sell token and to get higher confidence in execution. **It is still expected to be executed with a much lower slippage in practice.** See the above mentioned dune dashboard's *'order surplus'* whereby the order's slippage is protected.\n* 5 equal parts of 100 wstETH\n* Time intervals of two hours between parts \n\n## Methodology\n\nTo achieve this TWAP, the proposed transaction bundle will:\n\n1. Wrap the required `stETH` to `wstETH` so that it may be traded.\n2. Create a `Safe` owned by the DAO treasury that is used as a staging contract for the TWAP.\n3. Trigger the TWAP, with the resulting `rETH` from each swap being sent directly back to the DAO treasury.\n\n### Use of `Safe`\n\n* Developers: `Safe`\n* Audits: [See their Github Repository](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/tree/af488f0a649a3be2ea01e0f7a6af1587d0250c2d/docs).\n\nThe `Safe` is used as a staging area for the funds used in the TWAP. As CoW Protocol uses intent based trading, the `owner` of the order needs to sign their intent (done using a private key for an `EOA`, done using [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) for a smart contract). \n\nWith this requirement in mind, the DAO treasury contract for Nouns doesn't support EIP-1271. This is why a `Safe` is used in combination with `ComposableCoW` (detailed below).\n\nThe `Safe` that is created in the proposal bundle **ensures that the only owner is set to the DAO Treasury**. At all times, the funds remain under the direct control of the DAO treasury with the same timelock conditions.\n\n#### Execution Risk\n\nIn the transaction bundle funds are sent atomically to a newly created `Safe`. This means that the `Safe`'s address needs to be calculated beforehand. This is done using `CREATE2` logic, therefore the `Safe` is created at a deterministic address. The flow:\n\n1. DAO Treasury sets an approval on `wstETH` for the to-be-created `Safe`.\n2. The `Safe` is created and initialised.\n3. The funds are **PULLED** from the DAO Treasury to the `Safe`.\n\nCritically, with the above methodology there is *no ability for funds to be sent to an address where they are not retrievable*.\n\n**CAUTION:** This candidate proposal assumes successful passage of [Proposal #359](https://nouns.wtf/vote/359) **AND** no intermediate proposal that interacts with the new treasury's balance of `wstETH`.\n\n### Use of `ComposableCoW` / `TWAP`\n\n* Developer: mfw78 (funded by CowDAO Grants Program, and now a [Core Contributor to CoW Protocol](https://snapshot.org/#/cowgrants.eth/proposal/0x0202a88c6792d1bd1e534cf1da94769130f495e72247e666b4afff8b22da9db0)).\n* Audits (jointly funded by `Safe` and CoW Protocol): [Ackee](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow/blob/main/audits/ackee-blockchain-cow-protocol-composablecow-extensiblefallbackhandler-report-1.2.pdf), [Gnosis Internal](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow/blob/main/audits/gnosis-ComposableCoWMayJul2023.pdf).\n* Other: Repository recently on-boarded to [CoW Protocol GitHub organisation](https://github.com/cowprotocol/).\n\n`ComposableCoW` is a conditional smart order framework that was [incubated by the CoW Grants Program](https://snapshot.org/#/cowgrants.eth/proposal/0xb7815ca1f5aea2ec537295fd452332680eb1be379f3356950dc8ba151d83f9c5). `TWAP` is an order type implemented in the `ComposableCoW` framework. The contracts are thoroughly tested and audited. To date, volume processed exceeds ~$4.2M.\n\nUsing `ComposableCoW`, a smart contract (such as the `Safe` deployed in the proposal) is able to autonomously indicate its intent to trade. This intent is monitored by a *Watch Tower* (currently a Tenderly Web3 Action, deployed by the CoW Protocol team), with the intent relayed to the CoW Protocol API. In this framework - for TWAP, unlike `Milkman` - the smart contract specifies the *entire order structure to be submitted to the API*. There are no trust assumptions placed in the Watch Tower (besides the Watch Tower not running, leading to a griefing attack, but CoW Protocol for reputational reasons are incentivised to keep the Watch Tower operational).\n\n#### Differences compared to `Milkman`\n\nBoth were funded by the CoW Protocol Grants Program. `Milkman` seeks to solve the issue of an autonomous swap from ABC‚ÜíXYZ tokens, whereas `ComposableCoW` provides an entire framework for producing *conditional* orders. TWAP is an example of a conditional order built with this framework - allowing a large trade to settle in multiple parts over time, minimising price impact.\n\n## Proposal Operations\n\nThe operations in the proposal are:\n\n1.

We believe the app will enhance voter participation and democratize decision-making. The app will also serve as a valuable onboarding tool for new members and complement our existing governance clients. \n\n## Description\nWe have been developing an iOS app for NounsDAO. Our primary objective is to boost voter participation by providing Nouners with a user-friendly app that simplifies interactions with the Nouns protocol. We firmly believe that casting votes should be as effortless as sending a text message.\nThe core features will empower Nouners and community members to access the latest information and interact seamlessly with the Nouns protocol. Additionally, our experimental features will open doors to new onboarding methods, enhance community engagement and discover new utility. This app will be a valuable addition to existing governance clients, such as Nounsagora, Voter, Mmmogu, Nounoclock, Shenounigans, and many others.\n\n## Core Features List\n* Feed tab: Featuring the latest community, auction, trade, and proposal information in a clean and concise format.\n* Community tab: Providing an easy and concise way to find Nouners and delegates.\n* Auctions tab: Displaying the latest auction and market information from platforms like Opensea, LooksRare, Blur, etc.\n* Proposals tab: Read, track, and share proposals.\n* Wallet tab: Connect your wallet, check your Noun bags, cast and delegate votes (with Metamask, Rainbow, etc., integration).\n* Push notifications: A flexible notifications center for all activities, including notifications for specific trait minting, trades, delegations, etc.\n\n## Experimental Features\n* AirPlay support: Stream \"A Nouns Movie: Rise of Blus\" from the app to a monitor or TV.\n* Maps support: Display cities where Nouners and community members travel and reside (limited to locality).\n* NFTs: Distribute commemorative NFTs to active participants (those who check auctions more than three times a week receive a code to mint a unique Nounish NFT).\n\n## Timeline\n* Core features delivered in 1-2 months\n* Experimental Features in 4 months\n\n## Git repo\n* We welcome PRs at\nhttps://github.com/fiveoceans-dev/nouns-mobile/tree/main/ios-swift\n\n## Budget\n10 eth -

The company was founded by artist, designer, filmmaker, and teacher Paul Andrejco after observing the burgeoning pile of puppets that had accumulated in his Hoboken apartment back in the early ‚Äò90s. Now, just a few blocks away, Puppet Heap is home to teams of artists, designers, writers, and producers creating character based narratives for clients around the world including **The Walt Disney Company, Sesame Workshop, and Nickelodeon**.

And I knew I had to make it a reality and see what it could eventually become!\n\n# **WHY SHOULD NOUNS FUND THIS?**\n---\n\nStorytelling is everything - always has been. And in a world where we are inundated with ‚Äòcontent‚Äô online, a playful, quirky and precise project like this will be a breath of fresh air to stand out against the noise.\n\nUtilizing photography as a medium and consistent characters as the subject will allow fans to come back, excited to see where the journey of Chip and Benny will lead and who they'll be trying to 'help' next. \n\nAnd by staging everything down to the last detail, each photographic story that comes out of ‚ÄòNoun en Sc√®ne‚Äô will simultaneously be a fine art piece, a Sunday (web)comic and continuous character development leading to a broader (and very Noun-curious) audience. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreid2an66kifpojvxdzq4pjmnw5ix2cynbqhwemincxiclap2a65i3y)\n\nAnd in the spirit of '**mint everything**,' we are planning to utilize Zora to **mint and document our progress** - design sketches, scripts, behind the scenes, etc. It feels like a great way to document the process of creation and build something creative in public. \n\n# **Speaking of creative, meet Benny!**\nHere's Paul's initial design for Benny:\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeiad34c4vymsclagkv3jrfzag6hzuzpys5ttuqrpejtekgjjh7j27u)\n\nArms and legs, oh my! With our puppets, we want to keep what makes Nouns distinct while adding a whole new flavor that brings them to life and gives them character. \n\n### **The (mis)adventures of Chip and Benny** \nBy creating empathy and connection with our two little Nouns through **visual storytelling**, the project will help spread Nouns and nounish-ness far and wide - just how Chip and Benny would want it. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreib5bcbujje7cllcnu4f7iiwympjh3hdlk6tnctarnv7tmpl52gv4y)\n(*One-shot example sketch - 'Chip and Benny Check for- AHHHHH!'*)\n\nAnd we plan to have this first leg of the project culminate in a **fun droposal** that takes Chip and Benny IRL in eye-catching ways (*see below for a tease*). \n\n# **THE ASK AKA THE BUDGET**\n---\n\nWe want to propose a tight, but realistic budget that still allows us to execute this at the highest professional standards, so that we can first not only prove the concept, but create something that rivals the quality of anything you'd see in a high budget studio release. \n\nWe want to go above and beyond everyone‚Äôs expectations for what 'Noun en Sc√®ne' can be because seeing is believing and we think this initial batch of scenes will prove the potential of building out characters in a uniquely nounish way and make people want to see where we can go with Chip and Benny in the future. \n\n**BUDGET:**\n* **$40,000 USDC (2 puppets x $20,000 USDC/puppet)** **one-time cost** for the design and fabrication of our ‚ÄòNoun Muppets‚Äô - this allows Puppet Heap to design, costume and build out Chip and Benny in their physical ‚Äòmuppet‚Äô-ish forms (**to be used again and again as the project continues and evolves**).\n* **$50,000 USDC** production budget to shoot and finish 5 'one-shots' - this will be a fully crewed up shoot with actors, set design, hair & makeup etc. and the budget will be used to pay crew, rent equipment, secure locations, finish photos in post etc. (all the production related expenses)\n* **Detailed breakdown** to give a general idea of how the funds will be used **[HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yym2vm-ojk9sXjrwziRHCDY6VYrSZPva3XBaryZLFUY/edit?usp=sharing)**\n* **1 NOUN post delivery** (*cookie head Noun 483*) - A big reason I want to do this is to become a more active and involved part of the Nouns community so I can more fully participate and build together with other Nouners\n\n**TOTAL BUDGET: $90,000 USDC + 1 NOUN (post delivery)**\n\n# **TIMELINE**\n---\n\nUpon prop passing, we can make our puppets and be in production in approximately **2.5 months** and aiming to have finished images ready **~1 month later**.\n\nAll the while **minting our progress and creative developments** on Zora.\n\n# **FUTURE STEPS**\n---\n\nMy aim for is to use the project to develop the characters and story of these two best friends on their journey to help and do good - even if it always seems to go a little sideways - in a surprising novel and onchain way. 'Noun en Sc√®ne' as the first piece will allow us to capture surprising, fun and shareable bitesize stories, which hopefully utimately brings Nouns into the real(ish) world and helps people fall in love with Chip and Benny.\n\nWhich brings me back to the aforementioned droposal! \n\nWhat better way to drum up curiousity than a **droposal** to help take Chip and Benny IRL.

Ed Balloon dropped the 1000 piece collection and it sold out, kickstarting production of the pilot. To help uplift other artists, Ed Balloon pledged 50 percent of the collection‚Äôs secondary sales toward The Ed Balloon Generational Wealth Fund, which collects work from Black and other under-represented artists in Web3.\n\n## CAST\n\n**Ed B ‚ÄúThe Puppet‚Äù** | Ed Balloon\n**Billy** | Seth Green (Robot Chicken, Family Guy)\n**Peggy** | Blair Socci (Comedian)\n**Savannah** | Destiny Lavigne\n___\n# Nouns Integration in New Episodes\n\nThe possibilities for Nouns integration within the Ed B The Puppet universe are infinite.

The Ed B ‚ÄòThe Puppet‚Äô Show will feature characters from different backgrounds, challenging stereotypes and fostering empathy among audiences. Through collaboration with the Nouns, we aim to elevate the visibility of diverse voices and promote a more inclusive entertainment landscape.\n\n## Utilize Satire for Social Commentary\n\nSatire serves as a powerful tool for social commentary, allowing us to address pertinent societal issues in a thought-provoking and engaging manner. By employing satire, we can challenge the status quo, stimulate critical thinking, and spark conversations that lead to positive change. Our collaboration with the Nouns will provide a platform for satirical content that encourages viewers to question and reconsider established norms.\n\n## Promote Collaboration and Solidarity\n\nOur project embraces the spirit of collaboration within the web3 community. By partnering with the Nouns, we aim to showcase the power of collaboration in amplifying diverse voices and driving innovation. Through cross-platform promotions, joint marketing initiatives, and immersive fan experiences, we can create a unified front that promotes solidarity within the industry. We will be using noun features (Noggles, characters, etc) in these episodes.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/LGpjxXz.jpg)\n# Creative Team\n\n## Ed Balloon [Series Creator & Creative Director]\n\nSpearheading cultural representation and identity through his music and digital art, Ed Balloon has solidified himself not only as a Web3 artist and musician but also as a community leader.

In the spirit of positive sum collaboration, we did not want to propose a total amount of PH funding that would be difficult to allocate to builders without diminishing returns. We also received some feedback recommending a reduced time scope to prove out MVP, and have taken this to heart as well. Ultimately, we do think there is room and need for some passionate parallel efforts when it comes to finding and funding good ideas in Season 3 of Nouns.*\n\n## **THE PROBLEM**\n\nNouns historically has used small grants and Prop House rounds to complement onchain proposals. The Small Grants Committee (later known as NSFW) and Prop House rounds had fueled considerable community contributions, propelling the protocol's momentum. But during the latter half of Nouns Season 2, obtaining small grants grew challenging. \n\nWe want to help patch this bug in the protocol, and bring back the Builder-forward Nounish Vibes that brought many of us here in the first place.\n\nWe are a trusted group of contributors in the ecosystem who are willing to collectively take on the challenge of running a dynamic and transparent Small Grants Allocation Pod, as well as coordinating and championing a series of exciting biweekly Prop House Rounds over the next 3 months of Nouns Season 3. \n\n[![s2-noggles.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/W4SHH2bj/s2-noggles.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/SX2dXbMt)\n\n## **THE PLAN**\n\n1. Coordinate with the Prop House team to set up two new \"Season 3 Grants\" Infinite Rounds, where anyone in the ecosystem can apply for retroactive funding up to a maximum of 5 ETH or proactive funding up to a maximum of 1 ETH. (Infinite Rounds are a newer piece of Prop House infra that allows orgs to deploy small grants funding in an organized and transparent way. See [Rug Radio Small Grants example here](https://prop.house/rug-radio-small-grants).) Our team will review grant applications on a rolling week-by-week basis, with a goal to allocate ~17 ETH per month, depending on submission quality.  \n\n2. Coordinate and trial a series of 3 monthly Themed Prop House Rounds with specific focuses such as ‚ÄúVisual Arts‚Äù, ‚ÄúKeep Nouns Weird‚Äù, ‚ÄúGaming/Esports‚Äù, ‚ÄúCC0 Music‚Äù, ‚ÄúPublic Goods,‚Äù ‚ÄúMedia and Content\" (Final themes to be Voted on by the DAO.) We plan to explore various token-voting methods, engaging the wider nounish community in some cases with a strong consideration for maintaining as much sybil protection as possible.\n\n3. Maintain a [Public-facing Discord](https://discord.gg/zY7jpzKwEN) and consistent messaging in the Farcaster Nouns channel, for community members to ask questions and receive feedback on their applications, while also using Prop House‚Äôs built-in comment functionality to provide ongoing transparent, public feedback on builder ideas as well.  \n\n4. Publish a public summary of funds deployed for full transparency and accountability.\n\n## **THE PEOPLE**\n\nFor an important program like this, it is essential to have a team that is 1) Known and Trusted, 2) Knowledgeable and Experienced About the Ecosystem and 3) Reliable at Execution.\n\nThe proposing team has all been active and trusted contributors to Nouns for 1+ years minimum, have an intimate knowledge of the Nouniverse, and have all delivered on past projects.\n\n*Core Team Will Include:*\n* [Al409](https://twitter.com/al409eth)\n* [BradQ](https://twitter.com/iambradq)\n* [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi)\n* [ChrisCoCreated](https://twitter.com/ChrisCoCreated)\n* [Joshua Fisher](https://twitter.com/JoshuaFisher)\n* [Maty](https://twitter.com/matyETH/)\n* [Prof Werder](https://twitter.com/ProfWerder)\n* [Sasquatch](https://twitter.com/PartSasquatch)\n* [SuperTightWoody](https://twitter.com/SuperTightWoody/)\n* [Tha Swami](https://twitter.com/tha_swami) and his daughter [Lil Purple Blueberry](https://twitter.com/lilpurpberry)\n* [Toady Hawk](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk)\n\nTeam will only be compensated based on individual participation via Coordinape rounds every month allocated by participating team members and will rotate through responsibilities. Funds will be managed in a 3/6 Multisig. \n\n**All decisions on funding will be made by committee vote with a reasonable quorum and never at any one team member‚Äôs sole discretion. We will seek input from Nouners on Discord and Farcaster early and often. If there are not enough good applications via Infinite Rounds to warrant the budgeted ETH, we will be mindful to stretch the funding beyond the 3 month mandate, or will return excess to the DAO. Members of the team will not be eligible for funding from either the Infinite Rounds or the S3G Prop House Rounds.**\n\n\n## **THE PRICE**\n\n- Season 3 Small Grants Infinite Rounds: 50 ETH\n- Trial of 3 Monthly Themed Prop House Rounds: 30 ETH\n- Admin: 25 ETH \n    - (Admin Expense Ratio: 23%)\n\n**Total Program Cost: 105 ETH**\n\n## **THE PAYOFF**\n\nIt has been quite some time since we have seen the Nouns ecosystem buzzing with the energy of artists and creatives, the insights of talented developers and the vibes of passionate proliferators. \n\nWe will put our reputations on the line and bring our considerable skills and dedication to bear to allocate these DAO funds as effectively and transparently as possible to the most passionate and deserving builders, coders and creatives in the Nouniverse. \n\nRecent Prop House campaigns run by BASE and ThankApe have shown that there are still thousands of builders in the ecosystem, who are hungry for opportunities. \n\n**We don‚Äôt want Nouns to miss out on capturing that creative energy in Season 3 and want to be a collaborative part of the solution.**\n"},{"blockNumber":18153307,"blockHash":"0x0200785a0d931a0238c1b27b4626ac616b5a3ec8e5e6f2735d2e36770207d442","transactionIndex":115,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xb7815027516072c2ab844afb29d1d639fa357a73808be477648adf9e4aad5cd5","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":374,"proposer":"0x696ed7b26f4B019CEeC78DC8b9140ad64A6f354B","signers":[],"targets":["0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":18189307,"endBlock":18225307,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18153307,"proposalThreshold":0,"quorumVotes":37,"description":"# Call for a Public Boycott on Nouns Auctions *** URGENT ***\n\nOG Nouners (like myself) are calling for a public boycott on Nouns auctions until 4156 voluntarily RESIGNS as a Nounder and FORFEITS his future distribution of Nounder‚Äôs rewards.

A proposal that generates more proposals.\n\n\nHave a look at the first iteration of [noundry-gallery.wtf](https://noundry-gallery.wtf/)\n![](https://imgur.com/kIF3iq6.gif)\n\n## **IDEA**\n\n### **BEYOND DISCORD**\n\nThe Noundry channel on Discord is one of the coolest places in the nouniverse, where dozens of artists share Nouns designs and riff off each other. However, it is somewhat niche, and not enough people are aware of it.\n\nTo address that, we want to create a public-facing gallery that will help us attract more artists and community's traits.\n\n### **PROP #348**\n\nThis idea took shape while considering the anniversary [prop #348](https://nouns.wtf/vote/348), when Goldy and team self-organised and stepped forward with some really nice traits. Thanks to them, Nouns had the opportunity to showcase its unique ability to redefine itself through user-generated content.\n\nHowever, the fact that they were the only ones to submit a proposal, despite the vibrant activity in the Noundry channel, highlights the need to make it easier for anyone to submit traits at anytime.\n\nWe took inspiration from [#348](https://nouns.wtf/vote/348) votes with reason and started building to solve this.\n\n**Noun40**:\n*\"1-Invite heads and accessories to be submitted whenever to a public place (have it be known that if your art gets included on the anniversary art update then you'll likely win X eth in retro funding enforced by tradition) \n2-Invite competition for curation through a mandated PH round 1-2 months ahead of anniversary. The mandated round selects the winning curation and includes a meaningful eth prize to incentivize and compensate for the work involved. \n3-The winning curation team submits the art update prop to coincide with the anniversary (given the legitimacy through the mandated PH round, it will likely pass)\"*\n\n**4156**:\n*\"(imho) the last step of removing the training wheels from the noundry should be the death of the convention that artwork only gets updated once per year and 8 traits at a time. It's a competitive advantage of nouns that the artwork is upgradable and the metaphor is open enough to support infinite heads, and we should be maximizing this advantage by engaging with artists, famous or anon, in every country, to make the heads collection as vast and high quality as we can. think of this as the Nouns version of the chain with the most proof of work. This could be especially important post v3. if many instances of Nounsdao have permissionless pools of capital, artists and collectors will be attracted to the instance that accumulates the most cultural capital, and new heads and other traits are an important part of this process\"*\n\n***\n\n## **NOUNDRY GALLERY**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/N21sSlv.jpg)\n*Light mode*\n\n[Noundry-gallery.wtf](https://noundry-gallery.wtf/) lets anyone with a wallet upload their 32x32 transparent pngs for head and accessory traits.Submit your traits, style them using existing NounsDAO assets, and share them with the community.\n\nNo strings attached: you retain all rights to your art until you choose to submit it to the DAO through a candidate proposal. If the proposal is approved, and your artwork is added to the collection, it will become CC0.\n\n*Note: We were reluctant on having glasses due to a potential high impact on the collection, but we might bring them back to satisfy other subDAOs.*\n\n ### **FIRST VERSION**\n\nSo far we've implemented: \n\n* Wallet connect\n* Style your traits with nounsDAO assets and publish them to the homepage and your profile page\n* Favorite traits\n* Sort traits by name, creation date, artists and likes\n* Sort through community members by names, total likes received, sign-up date and total traits submitted\n* Evaluate traits by combining them with nounsDAO assets by hitting the ‚Äúgenerate‚Äù button on the trait page\n* Edit your profile page and connect your Twitter account\n* Dark/Light mode\n\n![](https://imgur.com/CVAa70L.jpg)\n*\"Generate\" on the trait page to test different combos*\n\n![](https://imgur.com/UxdIrLW.jpg)\n*Community page with sorting mechanisms*\n\n### **NEXT FEATURES**\n\n*  Submit candidate proposal form: in a few clicks, select eligible traits from the site, generate images, encode traits using [Run-length encoding (RLE)](https://nouns.notion.site/Nouns-Protocol-32e4f0bf74fe433e927e2ea35e52a507#6bbc1162af90427bad2dda63a3b31254) and wallet sign a release form to make the trait CC0 if/when integrated with NounsDAO. This will output the transaction copy-pasta and the markdown, giving you all the necessary elements to create a proposal easily (see mockup below). OR/AND\n*  Autosubmit to the candidate proposal endpoint on Nouns.wtf using Nouns SDK and skip the markdown copy-pasta if that is a desirable option\n* Create a commission page where anyone can set up competition for a given trait ( 0.5 ETH for the best ‚ÄúGolf‚Äù or ‚ÄúBoat-anchor‚Äù trait for ex)\n* Twitter, Farcaster and Discord bots letting us know when new traits are uploaded\n* Integration with [Volky‚Äôs Noundry Studio ](https://studio.noundry.wtf/)(Create an ‚ÄúUpload to Gallery‚Äù button to directly open the \"Upload Trait\" modal on [noundry-gallery.wtf](https://noundry-gallery.wtf/).)\n* Ability to comment under each traits\n* Enable ENS avatars and usernames\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/11fHNmc.jpg)\n*\"Submit to DAO\" current mockup: Select trait, write a small description, generate sequential glasses and body color matrice to test combos, define compensation, attach release form, generate transaction with RLE encoding, and save markdown*\n\nWe want to leave room to learn from the community and see what features are desirable.\n\n**Budget: 21 ETH**\n***\n\n## **CURATION**\n\n### **NOUNDRY COMMITTEE**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/SQsJ0Zt.jpg)\n*10 Prop House elected curators NFT mockup*\n\nWhile [Noundry gallery](https://noundry-gallery.wtf/) can also be used for any subDAOs, when it comes to NounsDAO, we believe we should set up a process that guarantees quality and brand alignement. These pixels -along with the smart contract- support the treasury, and we should be considerate about what we choose to integrate with the current collection.\n\nWe suggest implementing a multi-step open process with a Prop House elected committee, akin to what large art institutions would employ, albeit executed on-chain.\n\nWe plan to conduct a Prop House round to elect 10 curators who will have the responsibility of selecting traits over the next 6 months. Each curator will receive a curator NFT and will be able to use their NFT to like traits on the platform.\n\nIf a trait receives likes from 8 curators or more, a 0.1ETH prize will be unlocked, and the trait can then be selected and proposed on-chain using the Submit to DAO page. While curators can post their own traits, they are not allowed to like their own submissions.\n\n**Budget: 10 ETH**\n\n### **ARTISTS REWARDS**\n\nArtists will get 0.1 ETH prizes when they receive more than 8 likes from curators. This budget is intended to attract artists and reach a critical mass, making the platform more appealing. With a 10 ETH budget, we can create 100 prizes. \n\nIf the experiment is successful after 6 months, we can consider repeating the process.\n\n**Budget: 10 ETH**\n\n### **MORE**\n\nIf other DAOs or Nounish projects are interested in using this platform, we could explore implementing workflows to facilitate their participation. Consider, for example, the recent 'Gardeners' concept from Nouns 40; it could be readily sourced from the community.\n\n## **CONCLUSION**\n\n[Noundry-gallery.wtf](https://noundry-gallery.wtf/) wants to help curate the great work and energy coming from the Noundry channel. I hope that in the future we can see many cool Nounish traits emerge from anons, community members, or even renowned artists. \n\nThank you for reading this prop. If approved, we will implement this next set of features in 3 months time and start the curation program in January 2024.\n\n**Total Budget: 41 ETH**\n\nAny questions or comments, feel free to reach out on twitter: [@Coralorca](https://twitter.com/coralorca)\n\n ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n\n***\n\n**About me**\nOne of the first nounish builder - started in June 2021 and never looked back.

There is no physical delivery on this support.\n\n## **Concept**\n\nA defining underground force in menswear in the 2010s, Palace here echoes the new and weirdness of Nouns through a series of pieces that will hybridize their creative universes ‚Äì inherently Italian, boldly new, translated anew. The initial inspiration will be built on the Palace catalog itself and on the undeniable influence of Nouns on nft culture.\n\n## **Introduction**\n\n[Palace Skateboards](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) needs little introduction, but for the uninitiated, the London-based skateboarding and clothing brand has become a mainstay in the streetwear scene for incorporating 1990s and pop culture influences with their VHS-style clothing ads. In other words, it‚Äôs kitsch, cool, and everything in between.\n\n# **Why Palace?**\n\n[Palace](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) began as a brand for skateboarders. It is now a brand for all. Models turn up for castings in Palace. Working class Glasgow dads sport Palace. Jay-Z wears Palace. So does Rihanna. Teenage girls sleep in Palace, dreaming of the heart-throbs they‚Äôve seen wearing Palace online. 2018‚Äôs Wimbledon finalists played on court in Palace. Soundcloud rappers adore Palace. The ICA exhibits Palace. Serious DJs with peerless techno collections adorn their record boxes with Palace stickers. Ravers ingest ecstasy pills produced in the shape of Palace‚Äôs Tri-Ferg logo. Socio-political causes, including the plights of both Jeremy Corbyn and the people of Palestine, have been smartly memed in versions of the Palace triangle.\n\nA middle-aged architect can slyly intimate he has better kids than his colleagues by picking something up at Palace, even if it‚Äôs just their socks. Virgil Abloh and Marc Jacobs wear Palace. London tube station walls are adorned by carriage-length adverts for Palace. The bigwigs at Ralph Lauren were so taken by the irrepressible rise of Palace that Palace became its first ever collaborator in 50 years of singularly myth-making fashion history.\n![](https://imgur.com/dlwqvv6.gif)\n![](https://imgur.com/OEHdbcQ.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/KsVOGlC.gif)\nFashion‚Äôs favourite photographers Alasdair McLellan, Juergen Teller and David Sims shoot for Palace. Silicon Valley is full of people in Palace. Blue-chip stylists buy Palace from their own pocket money to lend their imagery some of the company‚Äôs off-rail styles and indigenous London magic. i-D and British Vogue carry Palace ads. Madonna and child (Rocco) have been photographed proudly wearing Palace. All the while, a fat lad on a Midlands housing estate is looking great and feeling even greater in Palace while waiting for his Chinese takeaway and playing Fortnite.\n\n## Strength in Numbers\n\nThe large take on several already-created collaborations and communication from other brands to the nft audience is an excellent entry point for the brand to reach fans and a new market. Likewise, for the Nouns community;  **significant increases in brand awareness, favorability for further collaborations, and open public interest in the brand, consequently becomes a win-win.** To highlight the ROI of the collaboration, let's look at promoting the Palace brand among your collaborations;\n\n[Gucci](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjsKDzipOtF), [Mercedes](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CbXyjVPq0VI), [New Balance](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cr-s3WotGz1), [Adidas](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoHewHju2Ii), [RIMOWA](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoUlcMeqvAs), and many others.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/qCpbrcS.jpg)\n[PALACE JAPAN MAGAZINE](https://www.palaceskateboards.com/range/spring-2019/palace-japan-magazine/)\n\n**Approach**: Use public communication-powered resources to compare social media posts containing mentions of the Palace and Nouns brand, before and after the partnership.\n\"Outcome: Insight into the Marketing ROI of an NFT Dive from Palace\" **‚Äú Significantly increases the reach of Nouns by talking to two sets of customers instead of one and gives a signal from one brand that the other brand is trusted by the upscale market.‚Äù**\n\n# **Phase One and Phase Two.**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/liP7MrS.jpg)\n\nDetailed legal processes and collaboration building over the next four months; **Phase one**\n\n‚Ä¢ Recitals\n‚Ä¢ Purpose\n‚Ä¢ Confidentiality Clause\n‚Ä¢ Commercial Clause\n‚Ä¢ Investment Clause\n‚Ä¢ Duties and Obligations of Collaborators\n‚Ä¢ Reporting and Project Management\n‚Ä¢ Intellectual Property Rights\n\n‚Ä¢ Fashion product mix;\n‚Ä¢ Creation and style;\n‚Ä¢ Prototyping;\n‚Ä¢ Product development;\n‚Ä¢ Marketing and Sales Strategy;\n‚Ä¢ Collection management;\n‚Ä¢ Evaluation of results.\n\nFor the scope of this proposal, Synthetic team is acting as the liason on behalf of the Nouns community and will adhere to all non-confidentiality & legal agreements relevant to Palace's collaboration workflow. Synthetic will work closely with the Nouns community to share public work-in-progress updates regularly which do not breach the above said agreements.\n\nSynthetic is a mediator, and nouns have a proactive CC0 license, In short Palace would not need Synthetic for commercial construction, what we are doing is raising ideas and presenting about the Nouns ecosystem: the various subgroups, the vibe, and the importance.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/ObE6wW9.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/sC8GwqP.jpg)\n\n## Breakdown of legal conditions\n\n**Strategy**: Legal terms and already transcribed collaboration construction.\n\n(the terms below will be robustly written to avoid legal inconvenience)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/fPYHHdj.jpg)\n\n‚Ä¢ Recreate the look and feel of the Palace collaborative product; designing new products for that collaboration; concentrated on multiple tacit marketing and management ideas that they share.\n\n‚Ä¢ Synthetic and the built committee will be responsible for co-managing the community outreach and communication campaign during construction.\n\n‚Ä¢ Creative control, both teams have to work within the decided parameters and cannot go beyond that and after each step, they must report to the other brand.\n\n‚Ä¢ Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace team's design and construction team. (This is due to several cordial agreements that the brand already has with the media ‚Äì Vogue, WWD, Hypebeast and others.)\n\n‚Ä¢ Nouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n# **Palace Nouns: What to expect**\n\nThe special line is a connection to the ‚Äúnew‚Äù and will feature easter eggs throughout to make each piece truly special. The icing on the cake? Palace will launch women's ready-to-wear designs, making this collaboration one for all genders. The build will be designed to be a capsule of 5 distinct items. Because both aesthetics have been merged, expect logos to do the same.\n\nOn Palace‚Äôs classics ‚Äì we're talking tracksuits, jeans, football shirts, skate decks ‚Äì you'll see the Nouns identity scattered throughout. You‚Äôll see this synergy on other more luxurious pieces, like a shearling jacket, as well as other unusual collectibles.\n\nAnother surprise for collectors is noggles Palace ‚Äì a witty homage to the ‚Äòweird‚Äô collection, if you will. The idea came up and its design is about to be created as a double brand, wrapped in the Palace Nouns monogram.\n\n## Palace Nouns: What will be delivered with the execution of phases two and one\n\nEntitled ‚ÄúPalace Nouns,‚Äù the capsule ‚Äì comprises statement-making garments designed for the collaboration. Jackets, noogles palace, vests, and skateboard decks are some of the pieces that are designed to be present, all adorning the new graphics, intertwined with the unmistakable details of Palace and Nouns.\n\nGlobal communication, Palace maintains a standardization of communication between its clients to build and launch a new collaboration; In their coverage, many media outlets go into significant detail about their collaborations and make them public globally.\n\n‚Ä¢ Looking ahead: Building a capsule\n\nA capsule collection is essentially a condensed version of a designer's vision/collaboration, often in limited edition, that transcends seasons and trends by being functional. Thus, focusing on building and delivering key looks, without the style and theatricality of a fashion show.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/5qLsHLr.jpg)\n\n**Nouns Palace will be a 5-item capsule.**\n\n**a % (percentage) of collection sales will be directed to the NounsDAO Treasury.**\n\n## Building in public\n\n**There is no precedent for similar proposals in Nouns**, a collaboration like this creates demand for interaction and content that can be used by other builders and future collaborations.\n\nMany of the processes built to reach an agreement with a corporate are extremely tiring and even building their direction and a good presentation, most corporations prioritize closed and legal agreements to add clauses and prioritize their Intellectual Property.\n\n‚Ä¢ Create a [general structure](https://mirror.xyz/0x905Ca7a9479EA1B9a8CDeD74da98e3CC5E6E2949) together with lawyer consulting to detail the collaboration and develop material to serve as a reference for other builders.\n\n‚Ä¢ Unfortunately, the fashion collaborations have had terrible results in Nouns. What makes this different?\n\nYes, we are aware that we have seen several proposals without any results, this creates a history for the community to reject future approaches in the same segment, but the work we are building is extremely detailed to avoid any interruption or lack of communication. Open and detailed communication framework, creation of the capsule aimed at the general public and construction of an official approach.\n\nBuilding an official approach aims to contain everything that is expected from collaboration and has never been met;\n\n‚Ä¢Campaign\n‚Ä¢Communication published on the Palace's official social media containing a pre-announcement of the launch date.\n‚Ä¢Sending email newsletters to existing customers, with previews of collaboration lookbooks.\n‚Ä¢Mainstream coverage, Palace is known for the buzz it creates when announcing its collaborations, due to the coverage and attention its clients and media outlets create.\n\nCollaboration is the combination of numbers and audience as well as the introduction to a new group of clients. **When we mention that there are no precedents built for Nouns, we reaffirm.**\n\n**Accountability**\n\nForm a Steering Committee: composed of [DeGenData](https://twitter.com/degendata), [Ccarella](https://twitter.com/ccarella), [Oni-apenoun](https://twitter.com/apenoun) and 1 other noun who have intimate knowledge of the brands present in the collaboration.\n\nProvide this committee with **frequent updates on clauses, legal terms, construction and execution of the collaboration.**\n\n[Supriyo](https://twitter.com/next_roy) and [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi) also made themselves available to help us by monitoring the execution of the collaboration framework and giving us closer feedback.\n\n# **What has been done so far?**\n\nWhat has been done so far?\n\nThe Synthetic project is somewhat similar to Nouns, they are both test projects, so the constant change is aimed at future research and long-term construction.\n\nSome of our achievements and experiments during this period;\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/fYjLkWZ.jpg)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/YbbKqSa.jpg)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/QXeZfjv.jpg)\n\nIn several of our experiments with DAO we had constructions just for the meme without considering the funding request.\n\nA document is being built on the mirror detailing our experiments and will be available on our [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/synthetic_eth)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/aQHXdNh.jpg)\n\n# **FAQ**\n\n‚Ä¢ Will there be any activation exclusively for noun holders?\n\nYes, In short - we will be designing the capsule with a variety of nouns specific perks in mind. Details will be defined during the ideation of the capsule.\n\n‚Ä¢ Will the capsule be made available globally?\n\nYes, with the exception of one item that will be available exclusively in certain regions.\n\n‚Ä¢ Will sales also be available in physical stores?\n\nNouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n‚Ä¢ Does this proposal cover actually creating the capsule? So the end result is ultimately Palace x Nouns clothes I can buy online?\n\nThis proposal covers the consolidation of legal terms, as well as the construction of the idealization/concept for creating the capsule. The construction with already defined direction and execution of the capsule will start in phase two (second support).\n\n## Funding Request\n\nOperations & Admin Compensation - ‚Ç¨47.000\n\n‚Ä¢ Compensation + fees for 4 Months of two full-time synthetic team members. ‚Ç¨37.600\n**(‚Ç¨4700 per member/month)**\n\n‚Ä¢ Legal expenses - ‚Ç¨15400\nLawyer consulting on clauses clauses established by Palace\n\nTotal =\n**‚Ç¨62400**\n\n# **Conclusion**\n    \n‚Ä¢ A collaboration is being established between Palace and Nouns.\n\n‚Ä¢ The request for this support covers compensation for the next four months of the team and legal processes and the construction of the ideation and detailing of the designer's capsule/collection.\n\n‚Ä¢ There is no physical delivery of this support.\n\n‚Ä¢ Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace project team.\n\n‚Ä¢ The importance of this collaboration for Nouns is absolute, where you have a conversation between two audiences, one of which is global.\n\n‚Ä¢ The specific amount of mass production of capsule items is still under study and will be detailed in the second support raised for the second phase.\n\n\n# **Team:**\n\n[Synthetic](https://twitter.com/synthetic_eth): project dedicated to the creation and transmission connections. Through this model, Synthetic has already contributed to five projects for the Nouns.\n\n**Considering the inopportune timing and where much of the attention is being directed towards the fork. This proposal has been restudied and rewritten a few times in the last week with feedback from the community and the committee itself considering the current market.**\n\n**Questions or comments?

We will take Public Good Beer to these markets, also integrating them into our onboarding ecosystem and turning them into real Nouns builders.\n\nWe are asking for 4350 USDC for label printing, marketing material, initial beer production (minimum 1500 cans/bottles), and aftermovies/content production FOR EACH of our partners:\n\n**Canil** (Portugal) üáµüáπ¬†- already committed to 1500 bottles and will launch in October, ahead of various crypto events such as ZKdevsummit, Dune Con, ETH Lisbon, EBS2023, Nearcon and Web Summit, all happening in November.\n\n**Stillwater Brewery** (Seattle) üá∫üá∏\n**Against the Grain** (Kentucky) üá∫üá∏\n**Wooden Ship** (Minneapolis) üá∫üá∏\n**Brewski** (Sweden) üá∏üá™\n**Bierol** (Austria) üá¶üáπ\n\nIf breweries exclusively produce the subsidized batch, Nouns' maximum cost per can or bottle, which includes premium beer, label printing, a launch event, and ongoing marketing and sales throughout the batch, is only 2.90 USD. Should the brewery opt for a larger batch, as is the case in Brazil, or produce a second batch independently, this cost significantly decreases.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of the funding goes beyond a single event. It serves as a **catalyst for wider influence and regular integration of Nouns into everyday culture.** This is evident in the growing number of [reviews](https://untappd.com/b/cervejaria-narcose-public-good-ipa/5389905) on the popular Untappd app (over 70 to date), spontaneous shares on social media, adoption by various Gnars-related activities in Brazil, featuring in the Nounish Punk game, and our successful production management in Portugal.\n\nüëâ **Accelerating Public Good Beer expansion not only brings legitimacy but also sustains a lasting cultural impact for Nouns.**\n\n**BUDGET: 6x 4350 = 26100 USDC**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jvG8dTb.png)\n‚Äé \n**2) Proper marketing in Brazil üáßüá∑**\n‚Äé \nInternational expansion will not be instantaneous, as it demands a free schedule in the industry.

We had 0.5 ETH for everything (sub-300 cans and a very short-scale marketing activation). Thus, the proposed expansion would bring the deserved impact and tons of resources for further promotion of the Nouniverse.\n\nWe are requesting 4350 USDC per quarter for the next six months to fund the activities below. We commit to at least one IRL event every quarter, but given the rapid growth of the Nouns community in Brazil, we anticipate numerous opportunities to engage with new fans.\n\n- Public Good Beer distribution\n- Marketing materials (shirts, stickers, temporary tattoos, and more)\n- Brand activations\n- Professional media production\n\n**BUDGET: 2x 4350 = 8700 USDC**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5JpkcCz.gif)\n‚Äé\n**3) New product categories üëÄ**\n‚Äé \nBeyond beer, we have the opportunity to extend the portfolio to two synergic brands/categories:\n\na) BBQ sauces - for the weekly beer-fueled barbecues we do in Brazil; and\nb) Sunscreen - for our community along 7637 km of coastline, with bikinis, surf stars, and sunglasses ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® \n\nWe would like to allocate a total budget of 5000 USDC for working on this as the project progresses.

NFTR has never raised seed funding.\n\n# What is NFTR?\n\nNFTR (NFT Registry) is a universal, permissionless NFT Naming Registry on Ethereum.\n\nNFTR allows naming any ERC721 with a globally unique name across all NFTs.\n\nIt's comparable (albeit different architecturally) to ENS for naming NFTs instead of wallets.\n \nNaming an NFT grants the NFT a NFTR Profile with soon to be integrated ERC-6551 functionality (a new standard for Token Bound Accounts) and extensive utility. \n\nNFTR provides an API so that any platform can pull and display names alongside NFTs.\n\nFor more details on protocol architecture, visit [NFTR.name](https://nftr.name) to view our [Docs](https://docs.nftr.name), try our live dApp, view NFTR Profiles at [name].NFTR.name, or engage on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/frMSHsAvay).\n\n![*Nouns that have been named on NFTR.

A funding infusion will accelerate development at a critical time, facilitate NFTR‚Äôs first marketing efforts, and permit other initiatives to cement NFTR into its sensible role as a necessary and universally adopted public good. \n\nThe Nouns community is full of individuals concerned with innovation and the welfare of web3. We‚Äôd be honored to enlist your support and advocacy, both as a Nouns brand and as a collection of highly sensible and web3 native individuals. \n\n# ERC-6551 Integration + Enhancement\n\nFrom ERC-6551's [whitepaper](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551#abstract):\n\nERC-6551 Abstract: ‚ÄúThis proposal defines a system which assigns Ethereum accounts to all non-fungible tokens. These token bound accounts allow NFTs to own assets and interact with applications, without requiring changes to existing smart contracts or infrastructure.‚Äù\n\nAnother quote: \"Each token bound account is owned by a single ERC-721 token, allowing the token to interact with the blockchain, record transaction history, and own on-chain assets. Control of each token bound account is delegated to the owner of the ERC-721 token, allowing the owner to initiate on-chain actions on behalf of their token.\"\n\nIf ERC-721s (NFTs) are to be so active, they must be simply and uniquely identifiable.\n\nENS, fundamentally, provides this service to Ethereum wallets.\n\nNFTR, natively, provides this service to NFTs and ERC-6551 Users.\n\nAs ENS provides limitless value and utility beyond reach/reference, so does NFTR. \n\n# NFT Name Integration\n\nNFTR Names can be easily integrated by ABI/API call into:\n* Existing NFT Marketplaces (show names below NFTs for sale)\n* Metaverse spaces\n* Web3 Games\n* Social media apps that display verified NFTs\n\nIntegrated NFTR Names are:\n\n* Quickly reachable by web domain at [name].nftr.name\n* Clickable, directing to NFTR Profile for direct interaction with the NFT\n* Interactive via NFT Messaging, direct payments, bidding, browsing NFT history, etc.\n\n# How Does NFTR‚Äôs namespace work?\n\nNFT Names are registered in NFTR‚Äôs [Registry Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc662a8ce36392d4b9489d0b59605a1874711bfc6). They are unique, meaning that no two NFTs can simultaneously hold the same name. They are NOT tokens or NFTs themselves. This brings the following benefits:\n* NFTR Name transactions are light (not gas intensive)\n* NFT Names are bound to the NFT, and travel with the NFT\nNFTR‚Äôs native name marketplace facilitates free in-wallet name transfer and buying/selling/bidding between wallets. Names are integrated into existing dApps via API/ABI call.\n\nNames are alphanumeric strings with no leading or trailing spaces, and are case sensitive for display purposes. But case-insensitive for duplicity purposes.\n\n\n# Similar Props\n\n**107 Verse**: Narrowly passed before funds were returned.

Artwork was created by [Facu](https://twitter.com/facuserif)._\n\n---\n\n## Context\n\nEarly in Nouns' history, PH open rounds served an important role within the Nouns ecosystem. It was a place where new builders could receive a few ETH for their early to mid stage ideas with less governance overhead. It was also a way for the DAO to create open competition around a not-too-big commitment of ETH spending, and allow the DAO to harvest the long-tail of ideas rather than being limited to what makes it onchain.\n\nHowever, over the rounds, voter attention waned and PH open rounds started to show its governance weakness. Unlike onchain props where every large voter ultimately paid attention to every prop and voted when necessary, PH open rounds started to go largely unattended. What's worse, rounds increasingly ran the risk of being arbitrarily determined by whichever large voter decided to engage in a given round.\n\nAs a result, the PH open rounds lost much of its legitimacy and we were unable to continue funding through it. Towards the end, we were running 2.5 ETH single-winner rounds every other week, funding a grand total of 5 ETH(!) per month through PH. The last round's outcome‚Äî[Open Round 21](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round-21)‚Äîwas determined by a single large voter as the sole voter of the winning prop.\n\n---\n\n## Proposal\n\nLet's kickstart the PH open rounds again branding them as the \"Nouns Garden\" (to make them more fun and memeable) and run a mandated PH round to elect 24 \"Gardeners\" to vote on the DAO's behalf in these rounds.\n\nRepresentative voting should allow for a more attentive class of voters to vote on each open round while the election ensures that the DAO voters still indirectly maintain influence over the outcomes of PH open rounds. \n\n## More details:\n\n**The Art:**\nThe gardener art work was completed by [Facu](https://twitter.com/facuserif) and funded using PH team's funds.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJyrigaCn.png)\n\n\n**Minting & Distribution:**\nThis proposal mints 24 Nouns Gardener NFTs initially going to the [garden-admin multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD94F65a9BFa4Fcb04FFbc0A64687667FcB28110e) managed by Noun 40 and seneca. If this prop goes through, the PH team will run the Gardener election mandate round. The winners will then be sent the Gardener NFTs which will serve as the voting token in the Nouns Garden rounds. \n\n\n**Gardener Selection:**\nThe Gardener position should be open to nouners and non-nouners alike and everyone that's interested in having fun doing civic service for the dao is welcome to run for the position!\n\nIt's desirable that the PH layer doesn't end up with an entirely disjoint set of voters from the onchain prop voters. Ideally, there's a lot of overlap and as a result the props that win funding at the PH layer will have a good chance of success receiving continued funding onchain if they continue to execute well.\n\nThe Gardener position will be re-elected at a 3 month cadence. 6 months or a year feels like forever in Nouns time. 2 months feels too frequent.\n\n**Gardener Compensation:**\nThe Gardener position will be volunteer roles without specific compensation (outside of the NFTs!)\n\nThere's a notion that delegate positions should be paid b/c reading props and voting is \"work\". However, not all civic service positions are better performed when paid, and there's also definitely fun and prestige in serving as a PH delegate of the DAO. This proposal intends to explore the potential of representative voting at the PH layer without adding financial incentives into the mix.\n\n**Gardener Voting Power:**\nEach Gardener will have the equal voting power (10 votes to spread across props in each round). If we start to observe bad behavior amongst Gardenders such as collusion or self-dealing, then we could institute quadratic voting where the cost of voting for the same prop multiple times goes up linearly such that it is harder to effectuate collusion or self-dealing. We're proposing to start with the simple voting scheme so that we don't unnecessarily introduce complexity.\n\n**Gardener Count:**\n24 was chosen as a size that is materially larger than committee sizes we explored in the past with NSFW (4-10) and DCS pod (5), as to assuage the concern (or perception) that a few people can be influenced to sway outcomes, while also ensuring that the Gardener election is likely to be competitive. It is not hard to imagine that we can elect two dozen worthy candidates. It is not clear that we could elect fifty. \n\n**Garden Rounds:**\nNouns Garden rounds will start off as 5 ETH x 2 winners (10 ETH) rounds every other week. \n\nTwo 10 ETH rounds a month still amounts to a very small percentage of our overall funding allocated through PH open rounds. We spent around ~900 ETH per month the past year, so 20 ETH would be ~2% of our spending rate. Ideally, the open-ended, lower friction, competitive, mid-tail funding the PH open rounds promise can scale further to be 10-20% of our spending, but we likely shouldn't start where we want to end up. We should scale up as builders return to PH and rounds remain competitive even as more funding goes through.\n\nOnce the PH protocol is launched, the DAO could vote on these parameters concretely. For now, we have to trust the PH team to execute these rounds.\n\n**Garden Funding:**\nNouns DAO has granted the Prop House team a total of 550 ETH over the last 2 years to direct towards Nouns DAO related rounds of which 160 ETH remain. These funds will be used towards the first quarter of Nouns Garden (60 ETH).\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\nIf the Nouns Garden is successful and continues after the first quarter, each quarter we will mint new Gardener NFTs such that Gardeners can continue to own their old NFTs as an object that holds provenance of their service. We would not expect Gardeners to transfer or sell their NFTs to someone else before the quarter is over given their reputation is at stake."},{"blockNumber":18189041,"blockHash":"0x595fc29fcbdbd37ecf5104f7d0bf6417353a515b784ce43a6a215133bb2c3e7a","transactionIndex":44,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xf801a2856c18720fc22047ed24b2e3f76b013e88322b4eddd1121038a3a92fcd","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":382,"proposer":"0x0658f4eD17289144717713ADfFC2539eF7c2EF8e","signers":[],"targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)",""],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000a1b74d2280966a89ac7e0f3a8bc5f0867c776d9800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000045d964b800","0x"],"startBlock":18225041,"endBlock":18261041,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18189041,"proposalThreshold":0,"quorumVotes":38,"description":"# Bring a million shredders onchain (revised)\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeic7eqjinmflf6xdlcmczpihjt45us53x5hlpdnrjh55l32fn3ixke)\n\nüìù *This is a [Proposal 363](https://nouns.wtf/vote/363) revision, addressing feedback received.*\n\n**[Gnars](https://gnars.wtf)** proposes a strategic initiative to empower action sportspeople through communal funding, collective creation, and shared proceeds.

Some of the most pressing challenges include:\n\n1. **Commercial Exploitation**: Outside brands jumping into skateboarding often prioritise profit over authenticity.\n2. **Loss of Authenticity**: Many skaters, due to financial pressures, might promote brands they don't genuinely align with.\n3. **Skater Exploitation**: Many skaters, despite their talent, don't receive fair compensation, especially considering the sport's physical demands.\n4. **Mainstream Misrepresentation**: Media portrayals frequently miss the genuine essence of skateboarding, leaning into stereotypes.\n5. **Skatepark Commercialisation**: Once-communal skateparks are becoming increasingly commercialised.\n6. **Core Values vs. Growth**: Balancing foundational skateboarding values with growth opportunities remains a delicate act.\n\nThe skateboarding domain needs a thoughtful equilibrium.

We're improving DIY spots and skateparks, making them better for everyone.\n2. **Nouns-Themed Sculptures**: Introducing Nouns-themed obstacles and sculptures in skateparks worldwide.\n3. **QR/NFC Plaques**: Simplifying onboarding with intuitive QR/NFC plaques at skateparks.\n4. **Subculture Expertise**: Leveraging our deep-rooted expertise to enhance Nouns' outreach in various subcultures, such as skating, rollerblading, surfing, bodyboarding, flying and other extreme sports.\n5. **Grassroots approach**: Empowering Gnars Shredders to engage their local community and organise meetups, beach cleanups and other forms of experiences that cause positive impact on their daily lives.\n\nOur target of onboarding a million shredders might seem lofty, but it‚Äôs just a fraction - 0.2% - of the 490 million participants in extreme sports.\n\nTo provide some perspective, skateboarding alone boasts 85 million participants.

We aim to replicate our success across multiple locations that arise through grassroots discovery and Prop House infinite rounds funding. \n\nBased on previous project expenses, we estimate 24 additional projects is an achievable outcome over the next 12 months, especially when focused on emerging markets where every gwei goes such a long way:\n\n- **Continuous park enhancements - 240,000 USDC**\n    - Skatepark refurbishments: 140,000 USDC\n    - Nouns-themed sculptures: 50,000 USDC\n    - Supporting Ambassadors/Shredders: 30,000 USDC\n    - QR/NFC plaques for onboarding: 10,000 USDC\n    - Miscellaneous & unforeseen expenses: 10,000 USDC\n- **Administration of funded projects - 60,000 USDC**\n    - Coordinate community-driven outreach and promo\n    - Discord moderation and general administrative tasks\n    - Onboarding support for grant recipients and builders \n    - Curation and support for new That's Gnarly creators\n- **Onchain (gas) and other expenses - Self-funded**\n    - Codebase maintenance, improvements and bug squashing\n    - Implement auction settlement leaderboard to reward settlooors\n    - Provide regular \"[Propdates](https://propdates-app.vercel.app/)\" to keep Nouns updated onchain\n    - Releasing collective productions atop zora protocol rewards\n    - Deploy open source portfolio at gnars.com ([GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/))\n\nüìù *Through onchain governance, we will allocate funds as earmarked. Finer details are laid out later in this proposal. If you've any questions, please don't hesitate to [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/gnars) for a discussion. We are here to help!*\n\n## üó≥Ô∏è Funds Allocation & Voting\n\nThe funds will arrive at `gnars.eth` which is our onchain treasury and DAO executor contract. It functions exactly as the Nouns DAO treasury does. Decisions are made through the usual voting process by [Gnars holders](https://etherscan.io/token/0x558BFFF0D583416f7C4e380625c7865821b8E95C#balances).\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifw3mcxausdmec7lkjd7dnpcwj6dxsfremcdweuil5nqr2oidixau)\n\nAt present, there are 3980 Gnars in circulation across 696 holders. We'd like to bring attention to the 8 largest holders as shown in the above screenshot, as they're very influential within the DAO, and have our best interests at heart:\n\n1. **[Non-voting](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0x0658f4eD17289144717713ADfFC2539eF7c2EF8e):** Instead of a founders' reward, 10% of Gnars are directed to the `shred.gnars.eth (0x06...EF8e)` multisig for onboarding shredders who are new to web3 and wish to participate in governance. Gami, who initiated the Gnars project, is instead rewarded in ETH as chosen by each bidder when placing bids in our auctions, using the bid slider. By default it's set at 90% treasury (`gnars.eth`) and 10% founder (`gami.eth`).\n2. **[Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami):** Hyperactive Nouns contributor, founder of Gnars, [Art Haus](https://art.haus), [Omega](https://omega.build), and author of [The Hypercommons](https://hypercommons.wtf/): A Manifesto for a Positive-Sum World. Visit his personal website at [gami.wtf](https://gami.wtf) for more information.\n3. **[Ric Burton](https://twitter.com/ricburton):** Early contributor to the Ethereum ecosystem and talented kitesurfer/kiteboarder. Has shown huge support to Gnars and has even been known to offer Gnars holders access to his beachfront property.\n4. **[Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi):** Perhaps the first person to arrive in the Gnars discord server and cofounder of [Alps DAO](https://alps.wtf). Showing early support as a collector, he's been an avid community moderator and wearer of many hats. Nounish AF.\n5. **[Satori:](https://twitter.com/0xsatori)** Also an early collector and contributor across all facets of the project. He has since become a valuable asset within various Nouns related teams and is the author of our [Gnarly News](https://gnarly.news) newsletter.\n6. **[Geffenz:](https://twitter.com/geffenz)** One of the most active auction participants, known more recently for the creation of [Gnarsauce](https://thatsgnar.ly/shop/gnarssauce), settling more auctions than any other, and for creating our \"Be Kind & Settle\" meme that led to [settle.wtf](https://settle.wtf) being deployed.\n7. **[DjjD:](https://twitter.com/TheDjjDAbides)** long time collector of Gnars having spent many hours in our Auctions discord channel along with Geffenz and other settlooors. He's a curator for [Redlion](https://twitter.com/redlion) and has been supporting us since our humble beginnings.\n8. **[Blockbird](https://twitter.com/_blockbird):** prominent [Art Blocks collector](https://gallery.so/blockbird), photographer and world traveller, who 50/50 owns Noun 189 with Gami and was also responsible for the inception of Gnars over coffee at a cafe in Sydney, January 2022.\n \n[The multisig](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0x0658f4eD17289144717713ADfFC2539eF7c2EF8e) mentioned at the top of this list at `shred.gnars.eth` was the original Gnars treasury, prior to our migration to a fully onchain nounish DAO in June this year. As well as receiving Gnars for shredder onboarding, it's used for proposal submissions such as this one, and the signers are as follows:\n\n- [Gami (0x38...fffd)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x387a161C6b25aA854100aBaED39274e51aaffffd)\n- [Benbodhi (0x80...87f6)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x80826180A2629206E3499B5167aaC8440E3F87f6)\n- [Blockbird (0x6B...4DDD)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6B67623ff56c10d9dcFc2152425f90285fC74DDD)\n- [Davin (0xdf...d939)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdfB6ed808fADddAd9154F5605E349fFF96E3d939)\n- [Vlad (0x41...be4A)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41CB654D1F47913ACAB158a8199191D160DAbe4A)\n- [Oni (0x91...2937)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937)\n- [22 (agreed to be removed)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E)\n\nSince no Gnars are distributed as founder rewards, all holders purchased all their Gnars themselves including Gami. who owns Noun 189, offering Gnars community the opportunity for delegation.\n\n## üß≠ Approach and Strategy\n\n[![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifkzcdwnvktxhmf47i67iel4gqyqtqc6jkhqc2xfxxqnfnmjr5dja)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3unXaYpMl8)\n\nüìù *Watch this NounGnarversary celebration funded via Prop House [on YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3unXaYpMl8)*\n\nOur strategy is multi-pronged, ensuring we address both immediate needs and long-term sustainability:\n\n- **Skatepark Enhancement Projects**\nWe've already showcased our impact: \n    - Opstacle (noggle rail) installations such as [the original](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0xb63306dbfe950dd9754d5edcf8f48c6ff9bdd32eeeff4c644cb90c974a3055fa) in [Pra√ßa XV, Rio de Janeiro](https://twitter.com/vladhzc/status/1660451083427143681) (Brazil), and others in [Nairobi](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye/status/1688473570119131136) (Kenya), [Domingo de Guzm√°n](https://twitter.com/PagesAndres/status/1632145699256016900) (Dominican Republic), and [Chicago](https://twitter.com/webgnar/status/1703201471255187565) (United States) with more to come\n    - Skatepark refurbishments such as [Skate Park Maracan√£](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0xb6f1781ada377924f11500e81735dd60170984c7976a1267027b3bd67fca93f1) (Rio de Janeiro), [Gigoia Island Skatepark](https://nouns.wtf/vote/142) (Rio de Janeiro) and [Meier Skatepark](https://www.gnars.wtf/dao/proposals/3) (Rio de Janeiro) are great examples of our contributions and collaborations\n    - Nouniversary events in [Pereira](https://thatsgnar.ly/thatsgnarly/stories/femboard-x-gnars) (Colombia), [Niter√≥i](https://thatsgnar.ly/thatsgnarly/stories/noun-gnar-versary) (Brazil), [S√£o Paulo](https://thatsgnar.ly/thatsgnarly/stories/uncharted-waves) (Brazil), [Nairobi](https://thatsgnar.ly/thatsgnarly/stories/noungnarversary-celebration-nairobi) (Kenya) demonstrate our commitment to Nouns \n- **Operational Funds for Notable Contributors**: Recognising and compensating our most notable contributors for their relentless efforts, unearthing grassroots opportunities around the globe, and keeping thing running smoothly\n- **Continuous Park Enhancements**: Establishing a treasury for ongoing terrain park improvements, ensuring sustained impact and cultural relevance, all incredible catalysts for ongoing content production\n- **Intuitive Onboarding**: Implementing QR/NFC plaques for commemorative purposes and seamless onboarding of new members to our ecosystem\n- **Brand Outreach**: Collaborating with authentic brands and influencers in the action sports domain to amplify reach and earn the respect of our peers\n\nOur dual focus on the action sports community and local councils ensures that our initiatives resonate with authentic cultural value. We reject the zero-sum and seek out win-win, positive-sum outcomes for all involved.\n\n## üöß Project Discovery & Selection\n\nWhile we have showcased our past skatepark refurbishments, the future projects are yet to be determined. Gnars original focus was on sponsoring individual athletes, but we've learned that empowering them to uplift their entire community is far more impactful. We wanna help create local heroes!\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeigfvokrjnehnlajktaca4wnarcd322gb2srdgy6flfhx6izmxbfse)\n\nüìù *Explore our Nouniversary events with the new Stories feature on [That's Gnarly](https://thatsgnar.ly/stories)*\n\nSkatepark refurbishments and opstacle (giant noggle rail) installations have proven to be the gifts that keep on giving. Beyond our initial unveilings and launch celebrations, our creations are often seen across social media. As shredders become intrigued by our artistic installations, they are often inspired to capture and post tricks they perform on them.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeigfm66vmoqnarkg2fvgpyswwnio7wjupewbxqr3hytmk72tfbkkvi)\n\nüìù *One of many ways to see our creations surfacing on Instagram is [#gnars](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/gnars/top/)*\n\nThe selection process for which projects we pursue involves grassroots discovery by DAO members who are passionate about uplifting their communities.

We've been running an infinite round that funds artists to complete their designs that end up on skateboards ridden by Tom Rohrer in [his tutorial videos](https://www.instagram.com/toms_tutorials/). Once the protocol hits mainnet, we intend on being power users and believe Prop House is one of the most powerful tools available to communities like ours.\n\n## ü´Ç Notable Contributions\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeihr7uy7fgb2pz6inhpphj4kknd2aggrzszfg3an4plyoyb2vs2mfe)\n\nüìù *Visit [roko.dev](https://roko.dev/) to see our sustained growth of unique contributing users!*\n\nWe have a dedicated group of contributors who've naturally landed to fill certain needs.

Lowering the threshold increases arber competition, accelerating the process, decreasing their profits, and allowing them to drain less of the treasury.\n\n**Doesn't inviting arbitrageurs disrupt governance?**\nA lower threshold doesn't change that arbers will vote No on proposals and attempt to block spending.

Recently, I've seamlessly combined my passion for sailing with my deep affection for Nouns, crafting sailing events in both Seoul and New York, with the generous support of Props 102 and 173. Sailing, often hailed as one of the most esteemed sports, never fails to attract the attention of the media, guests, and local residents alike.\n\nIn much the same way that Nouns effortlessly align with cultures centered around skateboarding and running, they also harmonize beautifully with sailing culture. While sailing may be less popular or perceived as more challenging to engage in, it stands as one of the most inclusive sports, welcoming individuals of all ages, backgrounds, and walks of life.\n\nI am eager to extend my love for sailing to the Nouns community by curating a series of sailing events throughout 2024. These gatherings will provide a splendid opportunity to gather and share our ideas about future of NounsDAO.\n\n# Why Nouns Sailing?\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJjKkJqun.jpg)\nThe Nouns burgee flag debuted at the 2023 Nouns Sailing event during NFT.NYC, representing the spirit of Nouns and the tradition of the Nounish community. Sailing isn't just a sport; it's a symbol of dedication and camaraderie. Sailors are the ones we can entrust with building the legacy and traditions of the Nouns Burgee Flag.\n\n## 1. Sail with Nouns in New York Harbor for NFT.NYC 2024\n**[April 3rd, 2024]** Following the success of [Prop 102](https://nouns.wtf/vote/102) and [Prop 173](https://nouns.wtf/vote/173), I would like to organize a sailing event on April 3rd in New York with the help of the Manhattan Yacht Club. It is important to gather at least once a year to celebrate achievements, brainstorm ideas, and share thoughts. I believe New York is the best place for such gatherings. In April, it was an amazing experience to meet everyone for the first time in person. I think next year, we will have even more loyal people visiting New York.\n\n\n## 2. Support two Olympic sailors\n**[September 2024]** In 2024, all eyes will be on the Summer Paris Olympics. It presents a unique opportunity for us to showcase noggles during this prestigious event. Rather than simply purchasing advertisements, I suggest a more organic approach ‚Äì sponsoring Olympic athletes. My hypothesis is that by supporting these athletes during the qualification season, they will appreciate our assistance and, in turn, proudly display noggles at the Olympic games.\n\nShould this initiative prove successful with sailors, we can explore extending our sponsorship to athletes in various other sports. My initial proposal is to sponsor two Olympic sailors during their qualification season. The Olympic Sailing Competition at Paris 2024 will comprise ten sailing events, with a total athlete quota of 330. Qualification rounds commenced in August 2023 and will continue until April 2024.\n\n## 3. Road to J/24 World Sailing Championship\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7uN5xdw.jpg)\nThe J/24 World Sailing Championship stands as one of the most prestigious international sailing competitions. Our preparations for this championship will span an entire year. By fielding teams to compete in the J/24 World Championship, we aim to introduce Nouns to a diverse audience with different backgrounda encompassing professional sailors, Olympic medalists, seasoned veterans, all-female teams, collegiate squads, dedicated enthusiasts, teenagers, and newcomers who share a passion for sailing J/24 boats.\n\nOur goal is to bring the Nouns community along on this journey to the J/24 World Championship! This event represents the pinnacle of sailing competition, and every sailor aspires to participate (List of J/24 championships - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J/24_World_Championship)). All teams involved will take immense pride in representing Nouns on such a grand stage.\n\nThroughout the year, we will engage in rigorous training and proudly display Nouns-themed spinnakers in various cities across Korea. We have identified some of the most picturesque locations, including beaches, islands, and areas with industrial landscapes.\n\nTo further promote Nouns, we commit to maintaining an active presence on social media platforms. Sending teams to compete at this prestigious event presents a remarkable opportunity to raise awareness of Nouns.\n\nOur dedication extends beyond the competition; we plan to work tirelessly throughout the year to promote Nouns. Regular updates on social media will offer insights into our practices, races, and maintenance routines. We'll showcase the elegance of Nounish spinnakers, whether in leisurely cruises or intense competitions. Additionally, we'll allocate time to master sailing maneuvers that may be less familiar to us as racers, such as figure sailing and cascade formations, which promise captivating visuals for photos.\n\n### Meet the Teams\n1.

This is a proposal for a (very) low-risk test to earn yield for the Nouns treasury by utilizing Origin Ether ([OETH](https://oeth.com/)). Converting 1 ETH into 1 OETH (they are 1:1) for 30 days would act as a case study to test that Nouns can safely earn high risk-adjusted yields for the treasury by utilizing OETH. \n\nOrigin Protocol is an OG team that launched in 2017. We launched OETH about 4 months ago, with the goal of making it possible for retail users to earn the same kind of yields that institutional traders earn, without needing millions of dollars and a full-fledged trading team. OETH deploys collateral to blue-chip protocols, distributing the yield back to holders daily via positive rebase. Current OETH yield is 8.01% APY on ETH, or about 2x that of the largest LSTs. \n\nWe have seen much larger test case props to Nouns ([Prop 320 for example](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320)); in our opinion this is much too large of an amount to test a new technology with, which is why we are proposing to begin with a 1 OETH test, and can submit an additional proposal in the future for an increased amount as the Nouns community becomes more familiar with OETH. \n\nThis proposal will include two transactions: the first to convert 1 ETH into 1 OETH, and the second to opt the Nouns wallet in for yield generation.\n\nA more detailed overview on the proposal and on how OETH works can be found below. \n\n![OETH Graphic](https://imageupload.io/ib/3Uu8NmrrBr6axiU_1695230390.png)\n\n## Stacking Treasury Yield With OETH\n\nPrevious Relevant Proposals:\n18 - [Stake 1 eth in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/18)\n22 - [Stake 10% of treasury in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/22)\n30 - [Stake additional 10% of treasury in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/30)\n52 - [Increase Treasury stETH Position to ~20%](https://nouns.wtf/vote/52)\n217 - [Stake additional 5000 ETH in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/217)\n227 - [Stake additional 5000 ETH in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/227)\n313 - [stETH peg protection](https://nouns.wtf/vote/313)\n320 - [Treasury Diversification](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320)\n\n**Summary**: \n\nThis is a proposal to convert 1 ETH into 1 Origin Ether ([OETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/origin-ether)) to test OETH yield generation for the Nouns treasury.\n\n**Abstract**:\n\nThis is a low-risk test to increase the yield of the Nouns treasury ETH/stETH from 0-4% to 8-10% utilizing Origin Ether (OETH). Converting 1 ETH into 1 OETH for 30 days would form a similar hypothesis as proposal 18 - in this case, that Nouns can safely stack yields utilizing OETH. \n\n**Motivation**:\n\nFrom proposals 18, 22, 30, 52, 217, and 227, it is clear that the Nouns DAO was interested in earning yield on the treasury and extending the project runway. Proposal 313 signals that the community would prefer to continue earning yield with stETH, instead of eliminating risk completely and converting entirely back to ETH. Proposal 320 signals that other mainnet LSTs can be useful for treasury diversification. \n\nThe OETH TVL has been trending upwards at a rate of about $1m per day since launch and has been crushing it in comparison to direct competitors with the yield we are generating. OETH yield is currently at 8.01% APY, whereas icETH APY is down to 2.94% and Cian stETH strategy is down to 4.02% despite taking leverage.\n\nWe are proposing to begin with 1 OETH, and can submit an additional proposal in the future to increase the amount as the community becomes more familiar with OETH. OETH provides significantly increased yields while also protecting against centralization and slashing events. \n\n\n## OETH Overview\n\nOrigin Ether was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC20 LST aggregator that generates blue chip yield while sitting in your wallet. OETH is backed 1:1 by stETH, rETH, frxETH, ETH, and WETH at all times; holders can go in and out of OETH as they please. Similar to stETH, OETH yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.\n\nOETH yield, currently ~8.00% APY, comes from a combination of:\n\n1. Deploying ETH/WETH on Curve, Convex, and Morpho\n2. LST validator rewards\n3. A 50bip exit fee is charged to those who choose to exit OETH via the [dapp](https://app.oeth.com/) (completely avoidable if using a DEX), this fee goes back to OETH holders\n4. OETH sitting in non-upgradable smart contracts does not rebase, instead the interest generated from those tokens is provided to those that can rebase\n\nThese 4 yield generating functions combined enable OETH to generate higher yields than holding or farming any single LST manually. The current collateral allocation and yield strategies can be seen on-chain at all times via the [OETH analytics page](https://www.oeth.com/analytics). Future OETH collateral and yield strategies are governed by [OGV stakers](https://governance.ousd.com/stake).\n\nObtaining OETH is seamless, anyone can convert from ETH, stETH, rETH, or frxETH into OETH via any of the following methods:\n\n- Minting on [OETH.com](https://app.oeth.com/)\n- Swapping on [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-298/deposit)\n- Swapping on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x856c4efb76c1d1ae02e20ceb03a2a6a08b0b8dc3&outputCurrency=ETH)\n- Swapping on [Maverick](https://app.mav.xyz/pool?chain=1&tokenA=0x856c4efb76c1d1ae02e20ceb03a2a6a08b0b8dc3&tokenB=0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2&fee=0.0004&width=0.001) \n- Swapping on [Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x856c4Efb76C1D1AE02e20CEB03A2A6a08b0b8dC3&chainId=1)\n\nFor this proposal, Nouns will be using [The Zapper](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/the-zapper) to convert the 1 ETH into 1 OETH. A second transaction will also be included to ensure the Nouns wallet is [opted-in for yield generation](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/elastic-supply/rebasing-and-smart-contracts). \n\n**Benefits of Using OETH**\n\nThere are a few reasons for why Nouns would choose to use OETH over of attempting to use the same yield strategies: \n\n- The yield will always be higher with OETH than if you were to use any of the same yield strategies, since not all OETH is opted-in for yield, and because of the exit fee. At the moment 23,731 OETH is collecting yield and 21,280 is not, so Nouns would receive this boost in yield from the OETH opted-out. With the exit fee Nouns would get paid each time there's an exit - occasionally this puts the combined yield into the 100s!\n\n- The Curve/Convex strategy would be very difficult (if not impossible) to replicate without having a Curve pool with a gauge + millions in TVL - Nouns would essentially need its own token and voting power and would be competing for yield with the other large flywheel token holders. \n\n- If Nouns were to do the same strategies, someone would need to manage the position. The OETH protocol would be that manager, with collateral reallocated among the whitelisted yield strategies each week. \n\n- The OETH protocol chases not just the highest yields but also the safest. During the weekend of March 10 when USDC and DAI depegged, it took the OUSD strategists/Origin engineers about 4 minutes to notice the depeg, and 16 minutes to start the process of moving the funds to a safer strategy. $0 were lost! \n\n- The OETH protocol covers all gas costs for moving funds between yield strategies, which is happening weekly but eventually will happen daily. With the price of gas on Ethereum, this could get costly for Nouns if Nouns were to follow the same reallocation schedule. \n\n- The cost for security - Origin has OpenZeppelin on retainer! Every new OETH contract is audited before going live. OETH security is prioritized over new feature development. The same level of security would cost Nouns millions of dollars in audit and development costs. \n\n- Top-notch development team - OETH shares 95% of the same code as OUSD, which has been live on mainnet for more than 3 years - longer than the Nouns DAO! The battle-tested code that has seen almost $400m combined has been and continues to be developed by a team of 10 full-time engineers. This level of talent required to maintain the smart contracts would be extremely expensive for Nouns, if Nouns were to try and replicate the OETH strategies. \n\n\n## Usage of Funds Generated\n\nSince launch, OETH has earned a yield of about 2x that of stETH yield. With the extra yield generated for the Nouns treasury, there are several avenues for using the additional funds:\n\n- Subsidizing public goods spend - Nouns traditionally spends ~800 ETH per month on public goods\n- Subsidizing Nouns marketing - this would offset the cost for future Nouns movies, paid promotions, conference expenses, swag, and Noggles \n- Subsidizing Nouns infrastructure and auction expenses \n- Subsidizing cost for collaboration with other projects - Pudgy Penguins is just the beginning! \n- Funding large team efforts for less - it would take 50% of the stETH yield to fund another Nounish or Agora sized team effort\n- Extended DAO runway - Nouns would extend the project runway twice as long\n\n\n**Community Cases for Increased Yield**\n\nI also don't think getting to our eth position to 100% staked eth limits our spending in any way‚Ä¶ the ~500 ETH additional yield we'll get from staking the 10k ETH is not nothing. It's being able to fund another ~$1M / year sized team. That's like being able to fund another nounish or agora sized team effort, which is meaningful! - *Noun40*\n\nI think the DAO should maintain around ~6mo of operating spend as ETH‚Ä¶ diversify into other staking providers to reduce concentration risk. Overall in agreement with staking more ETH to increase runway. - *cfeng.eth*\n\nThe income generated from holding stETH also amounts to ~500 ETH / yr, which is more than 2 weeks of auctions. - *noun12.eth*\n\nstETH is a better way of holding eth - *fugazi.eth*\n\nI believe there is already too much of the treasury being staked in Lido. I am not interested in staking more, and if I were, I would want to use some other protocol that isn't Lido since we already have a lot in Lido. - *onnnnnnnion.eth*\n\n\n\n## Potential Risks and Mitigation\n\nThere are six possible risks when using OETH, and Origin is making sure to reduce each risk as much as possible:\n\n*New token risk* - Given OETH is a relatively new token, some may be worried that OETH is prone to new attack surfaces. While this may be true for other new tokens, OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. Not that long ago, [OUSD reached a market cap of $300m](https://defillama.com/protocol/origin-dollar) without breaking, and without diminishing the APY it was capable of generating. Origin continues to work on OUSD, despite the lower market cap.\n\n*Counterparty risk* - OETH is governed by OGV stakeholders around the world. Everything from yield generation to fee collection and distribution is managed by a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts are upgradeable with a timelock and are controlled by hundreds of governance token holders. While the initial contracts and yield-earning strategies were developed by the Origin team, anyone can shape the future of OETH by creating or voting on proposals, submitting new strategies, or contributing code improvements. We intend for all important decisions to be made through community governance and limited powers to be delegated to trusted contributors who are more actively involved in the day-to-day management of the protocol.\n\n*Smart contract risk of the yield strategies* - Origin is only using platforms for yield generation that have a proven track record, have been audited, have billions in TVL, maintain a bug bounty program, and provide over-collateralized loans. Over-collateralization in itself, combined with liquidations, provides a reasonable level of security for lenders.\n\n*Collateral risk* - Origin has chosen 3 of the largest LSTs to ever exist to back OETH, and they have maintained their peg quite well since launch. They have also demonstrated significant growth in circulating supply, so the Origin team is confident that the 3 LSTs will maintain their peg and that OETH will remain stable to ETH. To ensure accurate pricing at all times, OETH is using Chainlink oracles for pricing data for rETH and stETH, and a dual oracle for frxETH that combines two sources: the Curve frxETH/ETH EMA oracle and the Uniswap frxETH/FRAX TWAP oracle. In situations where any OETH collateral falls below peg, [OIP-4 disables minting](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-dollar/issues/1000) of additional OETH tokens using the de-pegged asset.\n\n*Slashing risk* - Since OETH is collateralized by multiple LSTs at the same time, OETH is protected from slashing from any individual collateral LST. If there is a small slash, the OETH yield will simply decrease, as income will likely exceed the size of the slash. During a major slashing event, both the slashed LST and OETH will experience a drop in value relative to ETH, but OETH should not fall as low and for as long as the slashed LST, as the remaining un-slashed OETH LSTs will soften the blow. There will never be a negative OETH rebase.\n\n*Smart contract risk of OETH* - Origin is taking every step possible to be proactive and lessen the chance of losing funds. Security reviews are prioritized over new feature development, with regular audits being done, and multiple engineers are required to review each code change with a detailed checklist. There are timelocks before protocol upgrades are launched, and deep dives into the exploits of other protocols are constantly being done to make sure the same exploits don‚Äôt exist on Origin contracts. Security is extremely important to the Origin team. OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. All audits can be seen on [Audits - OETH](https://docs.oeth.com/security-and-risks/audits) , and OpenZeppelin is now on retainer. On-chain insurance protocol InsurAce awarded OETH and OUSD the [highest possible security rating of AAA](https://app.insurace.io/coverage/buycovers), of which only 3 other projects on the InsurAce platform have received. Optional OETH cover is currently available for both OETH and OUSD on InsurAce. Origin Defi also maintains a $1m bug bounty through [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/explore/), with a resolution time of 7 hours. \n\n\nExternal OETH analysis:\n\n[Llama Risk](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/asset-risk-assessment-origin-ether) - Asset Risk Assessment: Origin Ether (OETH)\n[Auxo](https://mirror.xyz/auxo.eth/1NXxHhJmj44EfHmvA5pEH7mpSLtg-CbYRqmuEkaTRRk) - OETH - Protocol Analysis\n\n\nOETH in the news:\n\n[Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/16/origin-protocol-enters-competitive-ether-yield-market-with-oeth-offering/) - Origin Protocol Enters Competitive Ether Yield Market With OETH Offering \n[TokenInsight](https://tokeninsight.com/en/news/origin-protocol-launches-yield-aggregating-eth-derivative-called-oeth) - Origin Protocol Launches Yield Aggregating $ETH Derivative Called $OETH \n[Blockster](https://blockster.com/maximize-eth-staking-yields-with-oeth-a-yield-bearing-ether-pegged-token-by-origin-protocol) - Maximize ETH Staking Yields with OETH: A Yield-Bearing, Ether-Pegged Token by Origin Protocol \n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\nPeter is a core member of [Origin Protocol](https://originprotocol.com/) and is joined by the fully doxxed Origin team and community, which includes hundreds of thousands of members and open-source contributors. Many members of the Origin team, including both founders, are holding a significant portion of their personal wealth in OETH. Origin Protocol‚Äôs corporate treasury is also holding millions of dollars in OETH. We have skin in the game and are willing to put our own money at risk with the code we have written.\n\nThere are no lockups with this proposal, Nouns can move in and out of OETH as the Nouncil, core team, DAO, and community desires. OETH remains completely liquid at all times, and can be spent in the same way as its backing collateral, if unexpected expenses were to arise.\n\n"},{"blockNumber":18221189,"blockHash":"0xaeb9fb567b3e180d35764b1642a016f3f008419d5b92a19eba62466c67acd872","transactionIndex":66,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x9a89cd459ae98541a33043b556d4a0e2ec2c8541f9ab4c79fbbd0ba84f550b6d","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":389,"proposer":"0x32d1A53f6709a03f4b6cf4cb0501204ba188d4f5","signers":[],"targets":["0xf28ed835261b005C490D9d3D9eaADC54d9737d87"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":18257189,"endBlock":18293189,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18221189,"proposalThreshold":0,"quorumVotes":38,"description":"# Creative Commons retry\n\nat a glance it appears circulating Nouns supported this tx. \n\n"},{"blockNumber":18248626,"blockHash":"0x8d6d51248c5a34876701cf0fbf4e9cab800fc02eaf8e6f8094cb89c3f032b3b0","transactionIndex":96,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x12358ce00dc309b42eb57a27e2b0bd0ab09a131fc8c70d6b6d8394ab29a06e6c","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":390,"proposer":"0xE76fEfBE562c9484e670E6B0Da678FD5ef769236","signers":["0x8d2B28265bEE1C926433A25D951adb03De9Ab275"],"targets":["0xE76fEfBE562c9484e670E6B0Da678FD5ef769236"],"signatures":[""],"calldatas":["0x"],"startBlock":18284626,"endBlock":18320626,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18248626,"proposalThreshold":0,"quorumVotes":39,"description":"# Investing in the Growth of Nouns DAO in JapanüáØüáµ\n\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/ndj/ndj_banner.png)\n# TL;DR\n[Nouns DAO Japan (NDJ)](https://discord.gg/a5467Y2bGs) is the largest Nouns community in Japan. [NDJ's Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns-japan)  has been a cornerstone of our growth and community engagement. However, we have noticed a decline in activity since our last round, Round-10. Consequently, this issue has been concerned many of us who see the immense potential in our local community.\n\nOne Major hurdle is the language barrier. Many Prop House events are in English, limiting the participation of our largely Japanese-speaking community.\n\nTo address this gap, we would like to kindly request your financial support to re-launch and sustain our Prop House for a period of one year. We believe this will boost Nouns DAO's brand awareness in Japan and create valuable content. We'll also look for self-funding options during this period. \n\n**Total ask: 18 ETH**.\n- Rewards: 0.5 ETH * 5 props * 6 times = 15ETH\n- Operations & Public Relations: 1 ETH/year * 3 persons = 3 ETH\n\n# What is Nouns DAO Japan\nPokemon, Hello Kitty, Anpanman, Super Mario, Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto, etc...

Our objective is to establish a new branch within the DAO, a more mature and secure space where artists can freely express their interpretations of nounish in art space. Simultaneously, we encourage the DAO to approach this topic with an open heart and mind. By promoting dialogue and understanding, we aim to challenge preconceived notions and nurture a more mature, accepting, and diverse community.\n\n\n\n**Note:** The project's creators have chosen to maintain their anonymity, prioritizing a focus on the project's message and artistic vision rather than individual recognition. \n\n\n\n# First Shot : Sensuality\n\n**Introduction:** In the world of art, sensuality has always played a vital role in evoking emotions, pushing societal boundaries, and expanding creative horizons. This proposal aims to investigate the profound connection between sensuality and art, while seeking funding for a project that celebrates and explores sensuality in various forms. By delving into this captivating topic, we aspire to craft a thought-provoking experience that visually engages and inspires the community. \nKeywords: Sensuality, art, community.\n\n**Body:**\n\nThe proposed project aims to create seven immersive art pieces, each representing different expressions of sensuality applied to characteristic nouns, corresponding to the seven days of the week. By collaborating with four esteemed photography artists, our goal is to craft a visual experience that celebrates sensuality and its richness.\n\nThese pieces will be thoughtfully curated to explore various facets of sensuality, including its ties to human emotions and the natural world. Through meticulously designed works of art, we aim to prompt viewers to contemplate their own perceptions of sensuality and challenge societal norms surrounding this often-misunderstood concept.\n\nTo ensure the success of this project, we are seeking funding to cover several aspects, including artist fees, additional incentives, production, and the care of these pieces. By securing the necessary funds, we can provide artists and staff with the resources they require to create impactful and thought-provoking artworks.\n\nFurthermore, this project aspires to extend beyond its initial phase. Future plans include organizing more immersive and expressive materials, enabling viewers to engage visually and musically.\n\n\n\n**Rise of Sensuality:**\n\nSensuality, often considered taboo in many cultures, holds delicate curves and unique identity within the body. Art, in its purest form, serves as a means of self-expression for the body, a visual language.\n\nAllow me to introduce one of the guest artists - [Guido](https://x.com/guidodisalle), a renowned name in photography, known for his aesthetic sensibilities and indescribable visual prowess.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/k4RMWal.jpeg)\n\n[Guido Di Salle's](https://www.flowcode.com/page/guido)\n\n**Minting and Distribution**\n\nOut of the seven pieces produced, only two will be made available for minting as limited editions, created by our invited artists. Details will be provided on each guest artist's profile when unveiling their piece.\n\n**Cost:** 7E to cover team expenses, provide additional incentives, and compensate the artists + 4 NounsVision to be sent to invited artists.\n\n**Conclusion:** In conclusion, this project seeks to explore the captivating intersection of sensuality and art through an immersive experience that can enrich our cultural understanding and initiate a new community. With secured funding, we can embark on a journey with talented artists to create a transformative experience, challenging societal norms and celebrating diverse expressions of nounish in the world of art."},{"blockNumber":18266735,"blockHash":"0x82344c5f6bcea02c9576d43ecc4214ab42284b17837681116a4b67f15d1b0a32","transactionIndex":85,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x6d32f45a30cf4f6136a6332a7703d478b7bdf3f53ea0e6d51b04308c4e201c70","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":393,"proposer":"0x387a161C6b25aA854100aBaED39274e51aaffffd","signers":["0x16C88a1f5580d5a6dAE0F7701E0b7C1341B8BFA6","0x2666f0C8FB58d182f2Dd79475DCA4A07B3724607"],"targets":["0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03","0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5"],"signatures":["safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)","sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)",""],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef710000000000000000000000003dfd76a87cf769275e5bc8c4ab77e47d50ecda49000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000021e","0x0000000000000000000000003dfd76a87cf769275e5bc8c4ab77e47d50ecda49000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000037e11d600","0x"],"startBlock":18288335,"endBlock":18317135,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18284735,"proposalThreshold":0,"quorumVotes":39,"description":"# Gift Noun 542 to Bob Burnquist\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeicmfhrpam75ycjyf7rjmvcern5f7ba4wn2xwlagryuyqq2jy2dreq)\n\n**Requesting Noun 542 and 15000 USDC** to assist with the tax burden of being gifted a noun, to a [hardware wallet address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3dfd76a87cf769275e5Bc8c4AB77e47D50eCDA49) retrieved from and owned by Bob Burnquist, the legendary Brazilian-American skateboarding hall of famer, and repeat Nouns DAO contributor.\n\n## üõπ Meet Bob\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeidvgfdn65nvwugmodzlqumyvskclhpkjv5pdosdpe3rbwjqixz2oy)\n\n[Bob Burnquist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Burnquist), a name that resonates with innovation, audacity, and unparalleled skill in the world of skateboarding.

The launch of [SkateboardingCares.com](http://SkateboardingCares.com), a collective that's making \"concrete waves,\" is powered by [That's Gnarly](https://thatsgnar.ly) and further amplifies his dedication to merging skateboarding with technological advancements.\n\n[![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeidmc4oopw35og6e37gtv7fpppurjnfm3zcrjfurymgwf76rnyknl4)](https://twitter.com/bobburnquist/status/1604636743332159488)\n\nBob's advocacy for the NFT space is evident in his active participation at various events. His recent presence at **Blockchain Rio** and the upcoming engagement at **Rio Innovation Week** from October 3-6 showcases his dedication to promoting the onchain world. With **Skateboarding Cares DAO** being a pivotal component, he's ensuring that the skateboarding community is intricately linked with the latest in blockchain tech.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeice6gg7is34tfvkx4iwbifdjcvg64fimxbjwgdfted44rpbikf274)\n\nFor those keen on tracking real-time updates on these endeavours, Bob's [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bobburnquist/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bobburnquist) both serve as a window into his contributions and the broader impact of these initiatives. Or to get some further context on Bob's involvement with Nouns DAO, check out [Proposal 142](https://nouns.wtf/vote/142) that was sponsored by Gnars DAO.\n\n## üî• Bring on the \"Burnquest\"\n\nGifting [Noun 542](https://nouns.wtf/noun/542) to Bob Burnquist would be more than just a token of appreciation. It would be a celebration of a legend, an acknowledgment of his contributions, and a testament to the indomitable spirit of skateboarding. We'd be embarking on a quest of serendipity together, where the potential for collaboration is boundless.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreicn34ghkmznkjyfn7zhbnyni73hwfmldaqhthpqivpi7frksopu2e)\n\nBob's committed to repping Noun 542 and participating in governance, as both a voter and nounish builder. His creativity and groundbreaking track record are testament to what he could, and already does, bring to Nouns. If there are times where his full focus is needed elsewhere, there's ample opportunity for thoughtful representation through delegation, either by his team, vast network with deep industry experience, or as part of educational endeavours at his institute. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeideeb4fbkn2i3s37fmq5tnkzr3krmi5l4wyza7sx7a2tcchkwddge)\n\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è *[Click here](https://www.voxels.com/play?coords=E@1007E,1112N) to visit to Bob's Voxels property (got a tour on our most recent call)* \n\nI've followed Bob's career since I was a child, and as an amateur skateboarder, I'm thrilled to have even met him, let alone be collaborating with him directly.

The goals for the burn are described in the blog post above by wilson.\n\nThis is a first draft of the proposal candidate through which we will ask the DAO to fund one or two audits of the implementation. We are putting it up even before we have quotes from auditors, in order to raise awareness among voters, stimulate the conversation, and listen to feedback.\n\n## Technical spec\n\nWe plan to deploy a new contract, with a single function that lets burn excess ETH from the timelock.\n\n### How much will be burned?\n\nExcess ETH is defined as the difference between the treasury value denominated in ETH, and: adjusted_total_supply * trailing_N_day_mean_auction_price.\n\nadjusted_total_supply is the number of minted nouns, excluding nouns held by the treasury or in the escrow contract.\n\nIn order to calculate the treasury value in ETH, the contract will consider only ETH, stETH, rETH & WETH. All other assets are ignored.\n\nThe number of auctions looked at when calculating the mean price is a configurable parameter; we suggest starting with 90.\n\nExample based on numbers close to actuals:\n\nTreasury has 2857 ETH, 10830 stETH, 228 rETH.\nAdjusted total supply: 394.\nMean price of last 90 auctions: 30 ETH.\nTreasury value in ETH: 2857 + 10830 + 247 (228 worth of rETH) = 13,934 ETH.\nExcess ETH: 13,934 - 30 * 394 = 2114 ETH.\n\n### What is burned?\n\nOnly ETH is burned. If the Nouns runs out of ETH, it will need to swap other assets (e.g. stETH) into ETH to allow for more burn.\n\n### When can it be called?\n\nThe goal is for the burn to happen at predictable times. One parameter will define what will be the first noun id at which the first burn can happen. Another parameter will define how many noun ids need to be minted before the next burn can happen.\n\nExample:\n\nSuppose the first noun id is set to 1000, and the number of nouns between burns is set to 100. The first burn will be possible once a noun with id 1000 is minted. The next burn would be possible once a noun with id 1100 is minted.\n\nEven if the first burn actually occurs when noun 1002 is auctioned, the next burn will still be possible starting id 1100.\n\n\n### Timelock upgrade\n\nThe timelock will be upgraded to a new version which will allow the burner contract to call it an burn ETH.\n\nThe timelock will only allow the burner contract to call it.\n\nThe address of the burner contract is a configurable param. Setting it to the zero address is effectively turning off the burn mechanism.\n\n\n## Audit costs\n\nOur plan is to undergo a deep code review with solimander, and an audit with [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/). In a bit more detail:\n\n1. Soli review (+ verbs fix things)\n2. Sherlock audit\n3. Verbs fix things + soli reviews fixes\n4. Sherlock mitigation review\n\nWe are asking for 30K USDC to be sent to the Tech Grants Pod multisig to pay for the audit.\n\n## Next steps\n\nFunding the audit will let us know the DAO wants the burn to be deployed. Once funded we will finalize the code, undergo the audit, and follow up with a proposal to upgrade the auction house contract and the treasury contract.\n\nThe upgrade will leave the burn disabled, since it seems best to separate the deployment of the mechanism from reaching consensus on its parameters. We will of course support any voters who will want to follow up with a proposal to set the burn parameters.\n\nIt's also worthwhile for voters to consider converting stETH into ETH ahead of the burn, since as mentioned above this simple design only burns native ETH.\n\n## Appendix: pseudocode\n\nExcessETHBurner:\n\n```\n\n// configurable params:\n\nuint numPastAuctions;\n\nuint nextBurnNounId;\n\nuint mintsBetweenBurns;\n\nfunction burnExcessETH() {\n\n    if (auction().nounId &lt; nextBurnNounId) revert('Not yet');\n\n    \n\n    allowedTreasuryInETH = adjustTotalSupply() * meanAuctionPrice();\n\n    excessETH = treasuryValueInETH() - allowedTreasuryInETH;\n\n    amountToBurn = min(excessETH, timelock.balance);\n\n    \n\n    nextBurnNounId += mintsBetweenBurns;\n\n    \n\n    timelock.burnETH(amountToBurn);\n\n}\n\nfunction treasuryValueInETH() {\n\n    return timelock.balance + stETH.balanceOf(timelock) + \n\n        wETH.balanceOf(timelock) + rETH.getEthValue(rETH.balanceOf(timelock));\n\n}\n\nfunction meanAuctionPrice() {\n\n    return mean(auctionHouse.prices(numPastAuctions));\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\n## Appendix: current asset breakdown\n\nAt the time of writing this text, [according to Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71):\n\n\n\n* Total treasury value is roughly $23.15M.\n* Its two main assets are:\n    * ETH at $4.391M (2631.493 ETH).\n    * stETH at $18.061M (10830.768 stETH).\n* These two assets alone make up over 96.7% of the total treasury value.\n* USDC is roughly 1.1% of the treasury, and we‚Äôre comfortable ignoring it for the sake of code simplicity.\n* wstETH is roughly 0.11% and is ignored as well."},{"blockNumber":18285030,"blockHash":"0xd44658cdeb5bacd34f747c153f172b103885128c50f46be2cddd4c930b5863f2","transactionIndex":123,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xf34e4dba0a4ef39f149b382579c22a2d3f17e66c6c89b9765d70c70729e8f455","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":395,"proposer":"0xD1EAeFBeFFD4106A1A166CD26a1Fe23140D6a42e","signers":["0x3B60e31CFC48a9074CD5bEbb26C9EAa77650a43F"],"targets":["0x0fd206FC7A7dBcD5661157eDCb1FFDD0D02A61ff","0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2","0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2"],"signatures":["createStream(address,uint256,address,uint256,uint256,uint8,address)","deposit()","transfer(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000d1eaefbeffd4106a1a166cd26a1fe23140d6a42e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014d1120d7b1600000000000000000000000000000c02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006523428000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000659c8c800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000806a6cbeb8752a4973327da04230a02a12dbb5d4","0x","0x000000000000000000000000806a6cbeb8752a4973327da04230a02a12dbb5d40000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014d1120d7b1600000"],"startBlock":18306630,"endBlock":18335430,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18303030,"proposalThreshold":0,"quorumVotes":39,"description":"# Aburra (fka Alphacaster): Nouns x Farcaster\n\nTL;DR: Requesting 24 ETH for Aburra (formerly Alphacaster) to explore the frontier of Nouns x Farcaster and build a best-in-class web3 social app for the next 3 months. Payment via steaming.\n\n\n### Overview\n\nFarcaster represents a unique opportunity to decentralize Nouns communication and bring Nounishness to more onchain organizations.\n\nAt Aburra, we have been building at the intersection of Nouns and Farcaster since early 2023 and have won Nouns Hack Week for our MVP v1 in April.\n\nToday, Aburra has evolved significantly since its v1. In addition to being both a Nouns client and a Farcaster client, it allows anyone to host Farcaster spaces where listeners can directly vote for proposals.\n\n![Aburra iOS](https://i.imgur.com/Fm3kQS3.png)\n\n\nOur ambition is not just to create the best Nouns client, but to make all DAOs more Nounish by helping them communicate on top of an open and permissionless protocol (i.e. Farcaster).\n\nWe also hope to use this prop to see what is possible when you combine two of the best web3 ecosystems - we want to push towards a future where open communication protocol is favored over Discord and Twitter.\n\n\n\n### What Aburra has delivered so far\n\n**Applications developed**\n- [Alphacaster.xyz](https://Alphacaster.xyz) and WebView-based mobile apps ([iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/JLPtu4r8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.alphacaster.app) - to be combined with the new app): DAO-specific Farcaster feed, governance notifications, enhanced proposal pages with cast-based comments etc.\n- A proposal bot ([@alphabot](https://warpcast.com/alphabot)) to convert all props, votes, auctions and propdates into casts\n- Beta Aburra app ([iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/uLiAhdUA) and web): Been testing it for two weeks and it now supports Farcaster space with native DAO integrations (proposal and voting)\n\n![Nounish Emoji Reactions in Aburra](https://i.imgur.com/RQCt0fz.jpg)\n\n**Current traction**\n- Aburra has become the default way for Farcaster users to consume proposals and votes. In the last 30 days, it had 3.9K unique visitors. It also has Warpcast [integrations](https://warpcast.com/dwr.eth/0x3cec05).\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oT7WtK7.png)\n\n- Since we started testing the new app in early Sep, we've hosted 9 Farcaster spaces for Nouns, Purple and Nouns Builder. 80 users have installed the [app](https://testflight.apple.com/join/uLiAhdUA). More Nounish spaces are in [the](https://warpcast.com/aburra) [pipeline](https://warpcast.com/toadyhawk.eth/0x64bd48).\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rXUDxAX.png)\n\n### Plan for the next 3 months\n- Full integration with Farcaster channels, including reading Nouns channel directly in\nthe app (and in any space)\n- Phase out the old Alphacaster app and merge all functionality into Aburra: this\nincludes implementing everything (governance feed, proposal pages etc.) natively,\ninstead of using WebView, which will significantly improve UX\n- Better space UX, with native DAO features (NFT minting, droposal, smoother voting etc.)\n- Integrate with more Nounish DAOs (and others!)\n- Launch Android\n\n### Team\n\nAburra has 2 full-time team members, billzh.eth ([@billzh](https://warpcast.com/billzh) on FC) and blingbling.eth ([@16](https://warpcast.com/16) on FC). Both of us are experienced developers and have built production-grade consumer applications.\n\nSo far we have received 12.9 ETH grants from Nouns Builder ([9 ETH](https://www.alphacaster.xyz/dao/BuilderDAO/prop/48)), Nouns Hack Week ([3 ETH](https://prop.house/nouns/hack-week-developers-developers-developers/5256)) and Warpcast ([~0.9 ETH](https://warpcast.com/v/0xd74872)).\n\n\n### Ask\n\nThe ask is 24 ETH (0.2% of current treasury) to help us continue to build Aburra for the next 3 months. That is, 8 ETH per month for a team of two.\n\nThe team is lean and we are confident to deliver a top-tier application with significantly lower cost than comparable clients (House of Nouns at [95](https://nouns.wtf/vote/242) ETH, Agora at [220](https://nouns.wtf/vote/154) ETH and Prop Lot at [60](https://nouns.wtf/vote/244) ETH)."},{"blockNumber":18289407,"blockHash":"0xc0153e14a3b1b697f697e4a182a13523d436eb19789e494b06c0f7261b7a5192","transactionIndex":58,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x28571c8a836194f9f59725a842f74541eecc9bedfccf2b31c15a0c214df6b4dd","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":396,"proposer":"0xE26D78c6bFF297Bbc2dA3f80FEA9a42028a4260F","signers":[],"targets":["0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03"],"signatures":["setDescriptor(address)"],"calldatas":["0x00000000000000000000000025ff2fde7df1a433e09749c952f7e09ad3c27951"],"startBlock":18311007,"endBlock":18339807,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18307407,"proposalThreshold":0,"quorumVotes":39,"description":"# Update the Descriptor to Reduce Auction Settlement Gas\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal resolves a storage creep issue in the Nouns' Descriptor contract, which has caused the gas required to settle an auction to increase with each added batch of traits.\n\nA [new descriptor contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25ff2fde7df1a433e09749c952f7e09ad3c27951) has been deployed with a simple optimization that reduces auction settlement by 40,000 gas, and prevents future increases as traits are added.\n\nThe art in the new descriptor contract is identical to the descriptor that's currently used in production.\n\n## Technical Details\n\nFor those who are technical, you can find the full changes [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/804/files).\n\nSimulations of Reduction in Gas:\n\n- Before: [87,367 gas](https://www.tdly.co/shared/simulation/567299e9-05cc-4f10-ac66-6b71dceb3fcd)\n- After: [48,121 gas](https://www.tdly.co/shared/simulation/99ac1499-fb4f-4d8a-99e4-6c115e336f2d)\n\n---\n\nSolimander"},{"blockNumber":18294133,"blockHash":"0xfcbb07065e36ebadd8003d94b79b27409cab7c4229e9bc99d121207c595cde86","transactionIndex":63,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x280eea7e99c464f76f09b4ed510795cb22347a03f4d849fd6c757eccbc31e3e6","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":397,"proposer":"0x7549DCAad7d31af14DD8a4ADF7cF8241D04Fa91c","signers":["0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9"],"targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5","0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)","","sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x00000000000000000000000035aa2666c8bc0aeb68ea64b463cf57a74bdbf977000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d18c2e2800","0x","0x00000000000000000000000035aa2666c8bc0aeb68ea64b463cf57a74bdbf977000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d062283600"],"startBlock":18315733,"endBlock":18344533,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18312133,"proposalThreshold":0,"quorumVotes":39,"description":"# Nouns Stories + Stoopid Buddy = Shorts Galore\n\n# \n\n# \n\n## TLDR\n\nOn the heels of [Prop 180](https://nouns.wtf/vote/180)‚Äôs and [Prop 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73)‚Äôs overwhelming success, we‚Äôre rallying the creative forces once again on what promises to be our biggest and most impactful proposal yet. Nouns Stories is seeking $1,795,000 to develop, produce and distribute over 50 Animated Nouns Shorts on a global scale with nine time Emmy-Award winners Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, along with 50 of the best animators in the world.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyIYuo7gp.png)\n\n[Nouns Short Shorts Trailer](https://youtu.be/QxrvHepTh38)\n\n## NOUNS: FRONT AND CENTER\n\nMost sources of financing for animated content are tied to networks that move at a snail‚Äôs pace and that are not considered artist friendly. This is where Nouns steps in to disrupt the system. We want to provide the proper funding to attract the world‚Äôs best animators, help them bring their ideas to life, and in so doing ‚Äî put Nouns DAO on the map as the number one source for innovative, diverse storytelling in animation. \n\nNot only that, but by making Nouns DAO the seed funder we‚Äôre putting the Nouns IP (and the brand‚Äôs aesthetic) front and center on a series of innovative and hilarious shorts that are bound to get massive amounts of attention with animation fans all around the world. What better way to spread the Nounish vibes and garner some positive attention?\n\n## PERSON, PLACE & THING: 3 THEMATIC ROUNDS, 50 CREATORS, 1 YEAR\n\nOver the course of the next twelve months we‚Äôll onboard 50 of the world‚Äôs most innovate animators to create engaging animated shorts featuring great characters, engaging storylines, and Nounish vibes. By expanding the run times and upping the budgets, we‚Äôll give the animators the opportunity to produce even MORE engaging visuals and storylines!\n\nWe‚Äôll roll out the animated shorts over three themed rounds. Other than requiring the films to feature Nouns characters or Noggles, we‚Äôll encourage the animators to go absolutely wild with the best and funniest ideas: the ones that may not exist within the walled gardens of Hollywood. Because not every artist has the bandwidth to produce longer form shorts, we‚Äôll keep the Short Shorts 15 second+ format for some of our creators. \n\nIn total the three themed rounds will feature:\n\n- 12 x 2-3 minute Shorts\n- 38 x 15-30 second Short Shorts\n- 3 original shorts by the team at Stoopid Buddy\n\n## 50 OF THE WORLD‚ÄôS BEST\n\nWe‚Äôll cast our net wide to onboard the best animators we can muster, and by allowing them the creative freedom to ***************do what they do***************, we believe we‚Äôll get the very best out of them. Not only that, but many of these talented folks already have huge followings online which will further expose the Nouns DAO to their legions of fans when we go live with the shorts and the post them to their own socials.\n\n## 3 STOOPID SHORTS\n\nTo kick off each thematic round, Stoopid Buddy Stoodios will pour all of their Nouns-lovin‚Äô-energy (see: Rose Parade / forthcoming Nouns Documentary) into making something truly special for Nouns ‚Äî a love letter in animation like only they can. They‚Äôll tap their A-list Buddies to create and voice these fully original mini-movies, creating some hilarious cohesion to what promises to be a wildly eclectic program!\n\n## CC0 Heroes\n\nAs we did in the first Nouns Short Shorts Festival, we‚Äôll encourage each animator to embrace Nounish culture by opting in to making their shorts CC0. While it won‚Äôt be required, opting into to CC0 will make their films eligible for some damn [fine awards](https://twitter.com/nouns_stories/status/1670029456688418818) and cash prizes!\n\n## OH YEAH‚Ä¶ONE MORE THING\n\nWe‚Äôll be hosting a *Nountastic* IRL animation festival to premiere these amazing shorts, attracting Nounish animation fans from all over the world.   Why do this when we could just hide behind the safety of our computer monitors? Because as we experienced with the first screening at [Braindead Studios](https://studios.wearebraindead.com/) in Los Angeles (in conjunction with the Melbourne screening at Pixel), there‚Äôs an *energy* and *magic* to bringing communities together to share in a truly unique experience that will help put Nouns DAO on the map. We‚Äôll invite all our industry pals, and will we live-stream the whole thing just as we did before? Abso-fucking-lutely!\n\n## IMPACT: NETWORK EFFECT\n\nThe first round of shorts garnered over **a million views** in the first month of release across creator and owned social channels. Most of these views were native to the creator channels of the animators themselves ‚Äî providing a whole new audience for Nouns. This time around, we‚Äôll not only continue to seek out animators with their own audiences, but amplify views across all platforms with a social media marketing campaign and enlisting a PR firm to bolster [awareness](https://www.animationmagazine.net/2023/07/stoopid-buddy-stoodios-chris-waters-unzips-about-the-nouns-short-shorts-festival/) of what we‚Äôre up to. On top of this, to build anticipation and excitment for the festival as the year unfolds, we'll create original promotional content, including teasers and trailers, behind the scenes footage, and creator profiles.\nCheck out some of the postings from our first Shorts Shorts Festival below!\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy2i70Kxa.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ctm_qiRBIre/)\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/By3o7AtxT.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CttDyBBo33G/)\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S13oQ0Yxp.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtgbaWPJ9iK/)\n\n\n## THE NOUNS STORIES TEAM\n\n**Stoopid Buddy Stoodios**\n\n9 time Emmy-winning studio behind *Robot Chicken,* and producer of over 1,000 hours of animated television **including: *Crossing Swords, Mickey Saves Christmas, and Marvel‚Äôs MODOK.* Stoopid Buddy is a pioneering independent studio that has helped drive the tremendous growth in adult animation over the past decade. Co-founder Eric Towner and Head of Development Chris Waters have deep roots in the Nouns ecosystem. Their first proposal funded the Nouns Rose Parade Float (seen by over 30 million people) and both are producers of the forthcoming documentary about Nouns.\n\n**Walter Newman**\n\nFormer SVP of program development at Adult Swim who oversaw such shows as Rick & Morty, Tuca and Bertie, Smiling Friends, Black Dynamite, and more. Walter brings network experience and a deep talent roster to the Nouns Stories team.\n\n**Goldy** / **Pixel**\n\n**[Goldy's](https://twitter.com/Goldypix)** Oscar-Shortlisted hybrid production studio is behind **[nounish ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®](https://twitter.com/nounish)** and the animated short film \"**[The Wizards Hat](https://twitter.com/nouns_stories/status/1570433066900017152?s=20&t=T_vYbAun_YQEsZUlEwfjSA)**\" from the original Nouns Stories proposal.\n\n**Joshua Fisher**\n\nManager of Grammy-winning music producers, music publisher, SharkDAO Rep, Ugly Noun, The Nouns Square co-founder, Nouns DAO Builder and Nouns narrative advocate.\n\n**Joel Cares**\n\nCEO of **[Lobal Global](https://lobal.global/) / [ANOA](https://anoa.ca)**, creator of **[Nerman](https://twitter.com/nermanbot)**, founding member of **[Nouncil](http://nouncil.wtf/)**, creative director @ [**JoelCares.net**](https://joelcares.net).\n\n## OUR ROLES\n\nWe‚Äôve got the experience, knowledge, and relationships to successfully pull off this wildly ambitious proposal. Not only will we be identifying top-tier talent from our own networks of creators, but we‚Äôll also be recruiting on a global scale to identify and onboard the next generation of up-and-coming animation talent.\n\nWe‚Äôll be managing and coordinating a massive effort to create decentralized content and creatively package it in a way that connects with audiences around the globe. Not only that, but we‚Äôll be tapping our extensive network to best position our exposure and distribution of the program online, at festivals, and beyond. We‚Äôll be coordinating a social media / marketing and PR strategy, as well as presenting ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù access and status updates to the DAO as this undertaking fully develops.\n\n## BEYOND THE PROP\n\nThe Nouns Stories team has over 613,620ish hours of experience in animation development, production, marketing, distribution and sales. Our team is well positioned to take these Nounish creations beyond what is promised in the proposal. Our hope is we can continue to develop the best-of-the-best beyond their existence as a short, and seed Nounish content and characters into the mainstream zeitgeist. Think about it ‚Äî *The Simpsons*, *South Park*, *Rick & Morty*, and hell, even *Robot Chicken*, all got their start **********as animated shorts.**********\n\n## THAT‚ÄôS A WRAP!\n\nAnimation drives cultural conversation. There‚Äôs a white space in animation that Nouns DAO is uniquely positioned to fill. Nimble development. Artist friendly. Global reach. We believe there‚Äôs a more ‚ÄúNounish‚Äù way to produce the next great animated shorts, and that we have the team to help find them and make them. \n\nFor Nouns, there‚Äôs an opportunity to be front-and-center in one of the most passionate arenas in pop culture and create break-out successes that proliferate the meme.\n\nOur team has poured our hearts and souls into the Nouns experiment since it‚Äôs inception, and we‚Äôve proven we can develop world-class animation and execute on ambitious ideas. We believe in a new way of generating content and organizing passionate communities of creators and fans. Together we can change the culture and build Nouns DAO into the next great destination for animation, so slap on your dang Noggles and let‚Äôs do this!!\n\n## BUDGET BREAKDOWN\n\n**TOTAL: $1,795,000 USDC** \n50% distributed upon commencement, 50% upon completion of first round.\n\n**Animation** **************Content - $1,270,000**************\n\n- 12 x 2-3 min shorts (3 rounds, 4 per round, $20k/short) - $240K\n- 38 x 15-30 sec Short Shorts (3 rounds, 12 to 13 shorts per round, $7.5k/short) - $285K\n- Three Original Shorts + packaging from Stoopid Buddy - $450K\n- Nounish Trailers / Behind-the-Scenes / Festival Recap Docs / Creator Profiles - $150K\n- ‚ÄúCC0 Hero‚Äù Awards (3 rounds, 15K per round) - $45K\n- Animation Festival - $100K\n\n**Management and Production - $430K** \n\n- Exec Producer Fees - $300K\n    - artist outreach and curation\n    - creative oversight and curation\n    - promotion\n- Producer - $100K\n    - Animator management\n    - Scheduling, Accounting and Deliverables\n- Web build and upkeep - $30K\n\n************************************General Operations - $95K************************************\n\n- Publicist - $15K\n- Social Media Mgr - $15K\n- Legal+Accounting - $20K\n- Event Planner - $20K\n- Team Travel & Accommodation - allow $25K"},{"blockNumber":18295251,"blockHash":"0x12ae5f562335b08e4f13de47b1bb140979eb23f61622d104bd27f915aaebc26d","transactionIndex":68,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xc1f67cbc2343e6132cbfb34d56f03ed0b3c6c32273f38fa1dd27536a28da8254","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":398,"proposer":"0x80212D1d03CB6A12b61cf5E98cA98D30C293127C","signers":["0x10deC36B4AC9d3b60490dFE2799881287d4a74cc"],"targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)",""],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000006ccb83c907dbf0b4bc28f9bf83173b0ab943350b00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014f46b0400","0x"],"startBlock":18316851,"endBlock":18345651,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18313251,"proposalThreshold":0,"quorumVotes":39,"description":"# Noun en Sc√®ne (aka Mise en Sc√®ne with Noun 'Muppets') - TAKE 2!!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyewEPEla.gif)\n\n### This is a resubmission of [Prop 371](https://nouns.wtf/vote/371). \n\nAnd if you're asking yourself, **'What's changed, Chris?'** Let me provide you with a quick and handy summary up top: \n\n#### **The Noun Ask**\nSome nuance was missing in the previous prop. I love the idea of 'earning' a Noun, and since (at the present moment) there is no defined way to do that, I decided to build it into the prop itself as a way to indicate that interest. \n\n**This 'earning' is not, however, a transaction in the current prop** but will instead be in a future prop that allows Nouners to vote on whether a Noun is **deserved or not** once everyone has seen the epically awesome results!\n\n#### **The Story** \nSome of you also wanted to hear a little bit more about the story these images would be capturing and I'm more than happy to oblige because for me, it's the characters, story and nounish themes that are the most exciting things about getting to execute 'Noun en Sc√®ne'. \n\nI see the Nouns as little, innocent agents of change, who are chock-full of optimism and doing their best - pulled and directed by their noggles - to go around and help people, even if they have no freakin' idea how! They might screw up, they might not know what they're doing, but that's never going to stop them from trying their gosh darn hardest to do some good! \n\nAnd to explore these ideas, I did a fun jam session working on a series document and a pilot 'scriptment' (*neither are finished or definitive, but a step in the creative discovery process that gives me a jumping off point as we continue to develop character, story and themes*) for the nounish show, 'G‚ó®-‚ó®D INTENTIONS', that doesn't exist, but whose episodes 'Noun en Sc√®ne' will capture cinematic stills from, making it seem like this nounish 'Muppet' show IS a real thing: *[WORKING SERIES DOCUMENT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sNWmF0Lhlqe7bRMHra9EKHyoLSPr3B1CDIwSJJw8sTs/edit?usp=sharing)*\n\n#### **Distribution Clarification** \nThe main goal of this project is to get these images out into the world so that people can see them and get curious about Nouns. And I think putting these kind of high-quality, cinematic images in places where NFTs are not often seen (specifically billboards but  also super large format at a gallery show) will allow them to function as both **quirky advertisments for Nouns and high quality art pieces that connect with people outside of this space**. \n\nThere is not, however, an ask for funds for the billboards or gallery rentals in this prop because I intend to do a **Droposal** afterwards where all of the NFT sales revenue goes towards this exact distribution effort (Yitong, let's talk!). **Digital funding physical!**\n\nAs mentioned in the prop, we will also be documenting the process of the creation of these images, so I foresee quite a lot of BTS content that is going to be going up through Zora and socials (maybe we could even do a **Nounish vid about it??**).\n\n#### And finally, **Project Clarification** \nI could've used this prop to ask for development funds for a script and storyboards and gone a more traditional route, but **I think that the deliverables coming out of this being able to live as a **finished photography series/art project** unto itself is far more exciting!** \n\nThis doesn't mean that I want the project to end or plan to end it after this prop's deliverables - *I mean, c'mon, we're going to have two incredible Noun 'Muppets' to create with!* - simply that **utilizing funds to execute high-quality, finished images that we can use to make people Noun-curious in IRL spaces right away** is far better than having *only* developed material with the *intention* to do more. \n\nWe want to deliver something final AND ALSO intend to do more :) \n\n\n### **And with that...** \n**Please find the sturdy bones of the previous prop with these updates incorporated below** üëá\n\n---\n# **TL;DR**\n\n**Cinematic stills from a television series that doesn't exist (yet!) starring Chip - a cookie Noun - and Benny - a rabbit Noun- in the surreal, funny and over-the-top adventures they find themselves on while trying to do good in the world.**\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ1-5UUsh.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r17M9IIs2.png)\n\n\n# **TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT? WHY OF COURSE!**\n\nA single frame can tell an entire story. It can draw you in. Make you think. Send you tumbling towards what happens next‚Ä¶ \n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyoqtGsuh.jpg)\n(*let‚Äôs put some Noggles on Roger*)\n\nIt‚Äôs what the best films do. I mean look at that Roger Rabbit still. What are Roger and Eddie looking at? What‚Äôs about to happen? And why are they handcuffed together?! Not to mention location, costumes, use of lighting or even the colors! There‚Äôs a palpable tension and curiosity in that single frame that makes us **care**. \n\nI want to bring that to a fun art project focused on a pair of Nouns - Chip and Benny - and their adventures in the - slightly (or sometimes *very*) heightened and over-the-top - world of ‚Äò**Noun en Sc√®ne**‚Äô.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJmaYfou3.png)\n\nThink of it as a cinematic one-shot storytelling project that takes our pixelated, digital little Nouns, turns them into real life ‚Äòmuppet‚Äô-like puppets and then throws them into film scenes with flesh and blood people.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkwdXQiu3.jpg)\n(*cinematic scenes that make you ask questions and keep looking*)\n\nEvery one-shot tosses our sweet, little Nouns into a new dramatic scene where they're forced to deal with the crazy situation they've gotten themselves into by trying to help or do a good deed for a random human they've met. \n\nAnd through these scenic moments, the world of Chip, Benny and the 'Noun en Sc√®ne' project will grow, evolve and hopefully become something people want to see more of!\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJMTUmid2.jpg)\n\nBy utilizing ‚ÄòMuppet‚Äô-like characters mixed with real people and heightened, cinematically-lit scenes, the absurdity and beauty of life will become that much more stark, profound and hopefully very funny. \n\nTaking cues and paying homage to a variety of influences including Alex Prager, The Far Side, world cinema, the Kermitage Collection and many more, this project aims to utilize a couple Nouns to create captivating characters we just can‚Äôt get enough of. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1_riGoO3.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1dHszjOn.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkX_jzi_h.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1CuBtIjh.jpg)\n\n\nChip and Benny are just a couple innocent, little guys trying to help and do good in the world, but instead they keep finding themselves entangled in situations way beyond their depth. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJCRRGj_3.jpg)\n\n# **COOL. SO WHAT‚ÄôS THE PLAN?**\n\nThese shoots will be treated like an indie film production - the difference being that we are capturing **single shots** that tell full, rich stories while still requiring casting, makeup, lighting, location scouting/rentals, puppet styling etc. \n\nOn the casting front, while at first it will make sense to work with local working actors/models and friends, as the project gains traction and grows - or when I‚Äôm working on my next tv show - I think there is a fun way to bring known name actors into these scenes and add a whole other level of playfulness to the project. \n\nThe first step will be designing, modeling and manufacturing our Noun ‚Äòmuppets.‚Äô **Luckily, I‚Äôve gotten a very exciting collaborator on board for this!**\n\n# **PUPPET HEAP!**\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJrVNiKx6.png)](https://youtu.be/agxY_pJwo8o?feature=shared)\n\n\n**Puppet Heap** is a unique design and production studio specializing in storytelling through the creation of iconic characters for all sorts of media including film, television, advertising, theater, and new media. The company was founded by artist, designer, filmmaker, and teacher Paul Andrejco after observing the burgeoning pile of puppets that had accumulated in his Hoboken apartment back in the early ‚Äò90s. Now, just a few blocks away, Puppet Heap is home to teams of artists, designers, writers, and producers creating character based narratives for clients around the world including **The Walt Disney Company, Sesame Workshop, and Nickelodeon**. Puppet Heap has been entrusted with the care, maintenance, and creative support of the Muppets for Disney‚Äôs **The Muppets Studio** since 2006.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyX40MsOh.jpg)\n(*Puppet Heap team on set of Imagine Dragon's 'Radioactive'*)\n\nPuppet Heap loves the project - *I nounspilled them* - and will be joining to design and create the physical puppets of Chip and Benny. And as scale and scope continue to evolve in their journey (we have big plans), they‚Äôll be there, helping to tell their growing story - and all the other Nouns that come into play too.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJXG1rDp2.jpg)\n\n# **AWESOME! AND WHAT ABOUT ME?**\n\nMy name is Chris Martin - not of Coldplay, sorry - and I‚Äôve been making independent, global film and television productions for a decade plus now - primarily in Korea.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HklvCzid2.jpg)\n\nMost recently, I co-created, co-wrote, directed, showran,and EP‚Äôed 20 episodes of a show called 'Dramaworld' currently streaming on Amazon that stars well-known actors including Liv Hewson (‚ÄòYellowjackets‚Äô, ‚ÄòSanta Clarita Diet‚Äô), Brett Gray (‚ÄòI‚Äôm a Virgo‚Äô, ‚ÄòOn My Block‚Äô), Daniel Dae Kim (‚ÄòLost‚Äô, ‚ÄòHawaii 5-0‚Äô), Ha Jiwon (‚ÄòSecret Garden‚Äô) and K-pop star Henry Lau.\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryG2-7jun.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Dramaworld-2/dp/B09QWZ45Y1)\n\nWith everything I create, I try to lean into **a playful, magical realist tone that‚Äôs grounded in heart**, which is the kind of storytelling that I think is not only a perfect fit for Nouns, but also an incredible way to bring people into this journey of Chip and Benny as they go around trying to help.\n\n\n\nI love everything about Nouns - the ethos, the support for creative, weird projects, and did I mention the freakin‚Äô Noggles?! - and have been trying to figure out how I could do something creative that furthered that mission for quite awhile now. \n\nThen suddenly, while wandering around a street festival the other day, I saw this:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkmKCfj_3.jpg)\n\n**And bingo! üí°**\n\nThe idea for ‚ÄòNoun en Sc√®ne‚Äô landed fully formed in my brain! And I knew I had to make it a reality and see what it could eventually become!\n\n# **WHY SHOULD NOUNS FUND THIS?**\n\nStorytelling is everything - always has been. And in a world where we are inundated with ‚Äòcontent‚Äô online, a playful, quirky and precise project like this will be a breath of fresh air to stand out against the noise.\n\nUtilizing photography as a medium and consistent characters as the subject will allow fans to come back, excited to see where the journey of Chip and Benny will lead and who they'll be trying to 'help' next. \n\nAnd by staging everything down to the last detail, each photographic story that comes out of ‚ÄòNoun en Sc√®ne‚Äô will simultaneously be a fine art piece, a Sunday (web)comic and continuous character development leading to a broader (and very Noun-curious) audience. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r12QW7iuh.jpg)\n\nAnd in the spirit of '**mint everything**,' we are planning to utilize Zora to **mint and document our progress** - design sketches, scripts, behind the scenes, etc. It feels like a great way to document the process of creation and build something creative in public. \n\n# **Speaking of creative, meet Benny!**\nHere's Paul's initial design for Benny:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1YB-Han3.jpg)\n\nArms and legs, oh my! With our puppets, we want to keep what makes Nouns distinct while adding a whole new flavor that brings them to life and gives them character. \n\n### **The (mis)adventures of Chip and Benny** \nBy creating empathy and connection with our two little Nouns through **visual storytelling**, the project will help spread Nouns and nounish-ness far and wide - just how Chip and Benny would want it. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJIwS910n.jpg)\n(*One-shot example sketch - 'Chip and Benny Check for- AHHHHH!'*)\n\nAnd we plan to have this first leg of the project culminate in a **fun droposal** that takes Chip and Benny IRL in eye-catching ways (*see below for a tease*). \n\n# **THE ASK AKA THE BUDGET**\n\nWe want to propose a tight, but realistic budget that still allows us to execute this at the highest professional standards, so that we can first not only prove the concept, but create something that rivals the quality of anything you'd see in a high budget studio release. \n\nWe want to go above and beyond everyone‚Äôs expectations for what 'Noun en Sc√®ne' can be because seeing is believing and we think this initial batch of scenes will prove the potential of building out characters in a uniquely nounish way and make people want to see where we can go with Chip and Benny in the future. \n\n**BUDGET:**\n* **$40,000 USDC (2 puppets x $20,000 USDC/puppet)** **one-time cost** for the design and fabrication of our ‚ÄòNoun Muppets‚Äô - this allows Puppet Heap to design, costume and build out Chip and Benny in their physical ‚Äòmuppet‚Äô-ish forms (**to be used again and again as the project continues and evolves**).\n* **$50,000 USDC** production budget to shoot and finish (at least) 5 'one-shots' - this will be a fully crewed up shoot with actors, set design, hair & makeup etc. and the budget will be used to pay crew, rent equipment, secure locations, finish photos in post etc. (all the production related expenses)\n* **Detailed breakdown** to give a general idea of how the funds will be used **[HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yym2vm-ojk9sXjrwziRHCDY6VYrSZPva3XBaryZLFUY/edit?usp=sharing)**\n* **Potentially 1 Noun** - If the results are of a quality that Nouners think warrants it, I ask that **another prop be put up to vote on whether a Noun (Noun 483, cookie head Noun from the treasury) has been 'earned' and can be sent as a reward**. A big part of why I'm doing this is be able to participate more fully and help provide a voice to shape the Nouns ecosystem going forward and I believe becoming a Noun holder is the next step to that!\n\n**TOTAL BUDGET: $90,000 USDC + Potentially 1 NOUN (tbd by future proposal)**\n\n**PAYMENT ADDRESS:**\nnoun-en-scene.eth\n0x6Ccb83c907dBf0B4bc28f9BF83173b0ab943350B\n\n# **TIMELINE**\n\nUpon prop passing, we can make our puppets and be in production in approximately **2.5 months** and aiming to have finished images ready **~1 month later**.\n\nAll the while **minting our progress and creative developments** on Zora.\n\n# **FUTURE STEPS**\n\nMy aim is to use the project to develop the characters and story of these two best friends on their journey to help and do good - even if it always seems to go a little sideways - in a surprising novel and onchain way. 'Noun en Sc√®ne' as the first piece will allow us to capture cinematic moments that bring Nouns into the real(ish) world and, hopefully, helps people fall in love with Chip, Benny and their continued adventures.\n\nWhich brings me back to the aforementioned droposal! \n\nWhat better way to take this project out into the world than through a **Droposal whose sales revenue will 100% go to getting these images up onto billboards and putting together a gallery show of a select number of physicals.** \n\nMore on both those soon! \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJFGYFIi3.jpg)\n(‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®'s *on billboards?*)\n\n\nPaul and I have a ton of fun ideas for where to take this and how to grow it, so we're looking forward to what we can achieve this go round while keeping our minds open to how it can be expanded!\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and look forward to making the world a little more nounish!\n\n**Time for Chip, Benny and their friends to save the world.

It‚Äôs a 2 weeks long event gathering blockchain / AI artists and engineers, collaborating on the creation of new NFT collections inspired by the notion of CC-0 and Remix. GLITCH is a unique opportunity to build new types of public goods, past editions have led to the creation of several protocols (e.g. REMIX NFT, IMPACT NFT) as well as an open source NFT Token-Bound Licensing standard to embed Creative Commons-like licensing conditions directly into NFTs.\n\n## ART RESIDENCY\nGLITCH is a two-week focused residency at an 18th century chateau in France. About 40-50 participants will be invited to create, imagine, develop theories, build projects and standards aimed at supporting a new creative ecosystem of open creativity and digital abundance in the blockchain art world.  The participants will be a highly curated group of creative and smart individuals actively engaged with NFTs, art, music and AI. The goal is to bring the right people, in the right place, at the right time, and then let the magic happen.\n\nAt GLITCH, we strive to empower people with ideas, visions, and expertise, while providing space for our attendees to reach deep into their minds and forge better models together. We exist to disrupt the status quo and to manifest positive solutions for society.\nThe outcomes of the residency will be, first and foremost, a tight community of value-aligned people eager to collaborate with one another, new collaborations and synergies in order to shape the world of tomorrow. The residency will also promote a variety of new initiatives about how to promote the value of openness and interoperability in the blockchain art world. Expected deliverables include new NFT protocols that encourage remix and creativity, new NFT protocols geared towards maximization of social and environmental impact, as well as a variety of collaborative exhibitions for NFT artists. All content produced within the residency will be released and made available to all under Creative Commons licenses.\n\nMore details about the third edition of GLITCH can be found at the [following link](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1xWfm3HfZJHDdlb8-7bhrVE4fWmNJDOhd)\n\n![GLITCH overview](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1EHB6ZJxOhGZOb1wWWz1YobCez6UViYop)\n\n# GLITCH Prop House & Droposal\n\nGLITCH is an avant-garde hub for blockchain art and innovation. We aim to utilize Prop House's pioneering mechanism to fund the creation of artworks and public goods that will be stewarded and/or mentored by the members of the GLITCH collective (artists, engineers, curators, etc). By harnessing Prop House's governance system, we aim to democratize the funding process, foster cross-pollination between the Nouns and GLITCH community, and support projects that contribute significantly to the blockchain art ecosystem.\n\n## GLITCH Prop House\n\nGLITCH will create a Prop House round for blockchain artists and engineers to propose artworks and public goods to be created during the GLITCH residency. Artworks can range from NFTs to physical installations; public good initiatives can range from developing open standard or open-source tools, organizing educational events, or supporting initiatives to promote the blockchain art space. Collaboration between artists, technologists, and other stakeholders will be strongly encouraged, leading to the creation of groundbreaking initiatives in the blockchain art world, and beyond.\n\nAnyone can submit a proposal for a new artwork or public good and request a maximum of 3 ETH. The GLITCH and Nouns community members assess the proposals and vote to allocate funds to the initiatives that align with GLITCH's mission of openness, collaboration, and innovation. Votes can be cast both by Nouns holders and GLITCH-NFT holders (we will distribute a GLITCH-NFT to all current and previous GLITCH participants, around 90 people total). Nouns and GLITCH-NFTs have an equal weight of one vote. We want Nouns holders to have a say on the selection of the proposed projects so that we can get feedback from outside of the event, to ensure that the projects that are funded are relevant not only to the GLITCH community, but also to other communities across the Nouns and NFT space.\n\n## GLITCH DROPOSAL\n\nThe successful proposals, if applicable (i.e. to the extent that they include the production of a digital artwork), will be proposed as a Droposal for Nouns. The proceeds from the Droposal will be split equally between Nouns DAO, GLITCH and the creator(s) of the artwork.\n\n![GLITCH people](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LWgWO67u5aDXgF7vP5rQej8bkIDPJL1M)\n\n# FUNDINGS\n\nThe full costs of the residency is **$60,000** (inclusive of accommodation and catering for all participants). We are requesting **10 ETH** to cover 1/4 of the costs. \n\nThe Prop House will fund proposals for up to **3 ETH per proposal**.

Herein, I propose to sell some treasury nouns at prices above the fork0-BV price. This initiative would provide individuals with the opportunity to acquire nouns from Season 1, offer the DAO a chance to expand the Nouners community, in addition to daily auctions, and generate additional capital for proliferation or burn.\nA committee of five trusted members will manage listing of nouns via a 3/5 multi-sig.\n\n## Description\nThis proposal aims to replenish the treasury and secure capital for further proliferation activities. Nouns had historically limited market availability, however there are indications that nouns are in demand; for example, Noun8 was sold for 49 ETH. Now that we have a treasury with lots of rare and beautiful nouns, I propose listing 15 nouns on open markets. This will help the DAO to refill the treasury and also attract new Nouners who appreciate the art, culture, and value of NounsDAO.\nThe committee members will determine prices based on market sentiment and in the best interest of the DAO. All ETH proceeds from sales and any remaining nouns will be transferred to the treasury after one month, which equates to 30 daily auctions.\nHerein, I propose the following tiered pricing for nouns based on their numbers:\n\nids: 0-99 at 43~51 ETH\nids: 100-299 at 38~43 ETH\n\n## Requested nouns\nThe sale of the following nouns should contribute 595~685 ETH to the treasury.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1VxBo_e6.png)\n\n## Policy and Rules\n**1.1** The 15 treasury nouns will be sent to the multi-sig wallet, which is managed by 5 trusted members.\n**1.2** The nouns held in the multi-sig safe are non-voting, meaning that the committee cannot use them for voting purposes.\n**1.3** Committee members will determine prices in the best interest of the DAO.\n**1.4** No treasury nouns shall be sold below the fork0-BV price.\n**1.5** The candidate proposal feedback section shall be used for suggestions.\n**1.6** The community is encouraged to propose committee members, and self-nomination is also encouraged.\n**1.7** All ETH proceeds from sales and any remaining nouns will be transferred to the treasury after one month, which equates to 30 daily auctions.\n\n\n## Multi-sig signers\nThis is a pro bono position, and committee members will receive a small amount of ETH to compensate for transaction fees only.\n\n1. __\n2. __\n3. __\n4. __\n5.

We've demonstrated this in the past to the [tune of 500 ETH](https://www.nounsagora.com/proposals/108). Instead of continuing with direct donation, I'm proposing that we leverage our financial and creative resources to make a film about PG, and release it as a mintable NFT whose proceeds go towards the Guild.\n\nThis is not only great for PG, but also affords us a unique opportunity to use nounish imagery, characters and themes in a piece of media that will widely seen in our prime demographic of humans who love and care for ethereum.\n\nIt's true that \"donating\" via a mintable film is more risky than giving money directly ‚Äì but I think telling the story of Ethereum and Protocol Guild through the lens of Nouns is something we can uniquely do. Other DAOs like UNI and LIDO may be able to donate more due to their larger treasury ‚Äì¬†but none have the mission and mandate to fund creative endeavours like we do.\n\nA successful $400k investment in storytelling can have a **broader reach** than our previous 500ETH investment and drive far **more direct positive attention** to Nouns while at the same time providing financial and cultural support to Protocol Guild. And we have evidence this can work, both from our [past](https://www.thisisnouns.wtf/) [successful](https://www.premiere.wtf/) droposals and the [Stand with crypto](https://zora.co/collect/eth:0x9d90669665607f08005cae4a7098143f554c59ef) mint.\n\n## What's the story we're going to tell?\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJuogvxb6.jpg)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/npgcssj0xy1xyid9utxob/Nouns_Pitch.mov?rlkey=z8cgbr02oza3e6wl1h3scv54z&dl=0)\n\nPlease watch Bjorn, our director, tell you the story, settings, and characters in his voice. We're working with a draft story and visual references, and will be refining it all over time with input from the Nouns community. Our current draft story is something like this:\n\n>This is a story set in a floating port town, which metaphorically represents the Ethereum ecosystem. Everyone is gathered to celebrate the return of the Protocol Guild, a group of adventurers bringing back innovations that will improve the town (metaphorically EIP-4844). The Nouns play host to these adventurers by inviting them to a big feast. We follow a young child who looks up to the Protocol Guild and follows them across their journey around town, in hope of meeting his heroes.\n\nIf you'd like to check out [the draft script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T1Gw8W74_9BR_o6ADetRxnyxza-SPR7lZdof9jTPslg/edit?usp=sharing) yourself!\n\n\n## The world and its characters\nYou should definitely check out Bjorn's video explaining the world in his own words, but check these images for a preview! And feel free to [flip through the reference deck yourself!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NI_MTJSPafHsAi-W37BWFQeDsi-uBFQe/view?usp=sharing)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJaijgagp.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ6jogpl6.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryTijlpe6.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkpjolTx6.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r16ssgpea.jpg)\n\n\n\n## Who's making the film?\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1OnCNL1a.jpg)\n\nWe're working with The Line ‚Äì a BAFTA-nominated animation studio whose work span across work for major brands and original animation. They've worked extensively with top tier artists and brands like [Gorillaz](https://www.thelineanimation.com/work/gorillaz), [Lil Nas X](https://www.thelineanimation.com/work/lilnasx-star-walkin), and [Marvel Studios](https://www.thelineanimation.com/work/hero-marvel-snap), and [Nickelodeon](https://www.thelineanimation.com/work/nickelodeon-vines). Our director will be Bjorn-Erik Aschim, who's also a studio co-founder.\n\nI reached out to them not only because they worked on a [viral Chobani video about a solarpunk farm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-Ng5ZvrDm4) ‚Äì¬†which I think visually and emotively embodies the vision the aspiration of Nouns and Ethereum really well, but also because they are one of the best studios in the world, whose work is widely recognized in the creative industry.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H11spyae6.png)\n\n## Funding & milestones\n**Funding**\n\nI'm requesting $400k USDC to fund this short animation. 100% of the amount goes to The Line to fund the development of the film. The funds will be released over 2 milestones: 1/2 upfront, and 1/2 upon completion.\n\nMilestone payment will be held in an escrow multisig whose signers are the Agora team and will be disbursed to The Line upon milestone completion. In the unlikely event that the film cannot be completed, the remainder funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\nThen, trent.eth from Protocol Guild will submit another proposal to the DAO to release the short film as a droposal with 70% of the proceeds going to Protocol Guild, 20% to Nouns treasury, and 10% to Agora. \n\n\n## What's Agora / Yitong's role in this?\nI'm incredibly excited about more Nouns-produced short films released as Droposals, because there's a real flywheel here if we can demonstrate that Nouns can create super high quality short films that also have real mint value. \n\nIt's why we're working on an [easy Droposals](https://www.nounsagora.com/proposals/346) creator at Agora, and I can think of no better film than one about Ethereum itself to demonstrate the power of Droposals.\n\n\n## Timeline\nDates are approximate, and may change by a few days depending on exact timing of the candidate approval. During the process, Yitong will serve as liaison between The Line and the Nouns community to make sure we have the chance to provide feedback during each phase of production.\n\nw/c 19th Oct - Proposal approved (PAYMENT MILESTONE 1 50%)\nw/c 26th Oct - Creative Phase commences\nw/c 10th Nov - Creative Phase Deck Approval\nw/c 16 Nov - Pre-production commences\nw/c 30th Nov - Edit Lock & Designs approval\nw/c 21th Dec - Layout approve\nw/c 21th Dec - Production commences\nw/c 25 Dec - Christmas Break\nw/c 25th Jan - Animation approve\nw/c 25th Feb - Comp approved\nw/c 22 Feb - Final Delivery (PAYMENT MILESTONE 2 50%)\n\n\n## A story in chapters\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryKSTlTeT.png)\nIf we're successful with this first film, we can serialize this into a series of short animations celebrating major Ethereum milestones so that we can both create an ongoing source of funding for Protocol Guild, and tell an episodic story that builds into a larger narrative and universe that can stand on its own and be appealing to a mass audience who might not even know about Nouns or Ethereum.\n"},{"blockNumber":18332676,"blockHash":"0xc5667554f8b77ec15a04ec2c99e5b31a12c7f7e582ef870ce4cad784322cd6bd","transactionIndex":115,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xc400f7a479e6501fd0087a3c12024779e32e3b51965f51a2772753b3ce55a753","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":408,"proposer":"0x7c1282a7621F0e2f6169E151628552A8B8a57B2d","signers":[],"targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x0fd206FC7A7dBcD5661157eDCb1FFDD0D02A61ff","0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x4f2aCdc74f6941390d9b1804faBc3E780388cfe5","0x0fd206FC7A7dBcD5661157eDCb1FFDD0D02A61ff","0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D","0x0fd206FC7A7dBcD5661157eDCb1FFDD0D02A61ff","0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)","createStream(address,uint256,address,uint256,uint256,uint8,address)","sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)","","createStream(address,uint256,address,uint256,uint256,uint8,address)","sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)","createStream(address,uint256,address,uint256,uint256,uint8,address)","sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000a8c14159c435e973fef0693358ecdd6e4ffe89d1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000342770c000","0x000000000000000000000000a8c14159c435e973fef0693358ecdd6e4ffe89d100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000054847c6e00000000000000000000000000a0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb4800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000659200800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000066303480000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000073aa3d1725186b342eda39692c6975ca0215347c","0x00000000000000000000000073aa3d1725186b342eda39692c6975ca0215347c00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000054847c6e00","0x","0x0000000000000000000000007c1282a7621f0e2f6169e151628552a8b8a57b2d000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000059682f000000000000000000000000000a0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb480000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000065920080000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006630348000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006dc04de8d949648ca5cbff5f6153aab1790ad3c5","0x0000000000000000000000006dc04de8d949648ca5cbff5f6153aab1790ad3c5000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000059682f000","0x000000000000000000000000b2333d61ff847148fe89901f34f7d9201cec25cb000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000059682f000000000000000000000000000a0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006592008000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000663034800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e1aa028e078dd9cbec8d2b6991c35286972cce25","0x000000000000000000000000e1aa028e078dd9cbec8d2b6991c35286972cce25000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000059682f000"],"startBlock":18354276,"endBlock":18383076,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18350676,"proposalThreshold":0,"quorumVotes":33,"description":"# First IRL Nouns Themed Playground\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryfDKFf-p.png)\n\n## tl;dr;\n\n- Construct the first physical Nouns Themed Playground.\n- Expand Nouns network value as an open-source brand & infinite work of art.\n- Disrupt the status quo and provoke how establishment perceives cc0 assets.\n- Allow organic interaction while capturing attention with charistmatic and value aligned public good initiative.\n- Develop a media documentary to capture the essence of the project;

Although ambitious, we pride to ensure **smooth execution** upon passing of proposal thus, prior to putting this together substantial legwork were done specifically in regards to obtaining authorities agreement.\n\nThis unconventional endeavor serves as a gateway and boundless potential to redefine the idea of \"Nouns.\".

It stand as an **tangible manifestation** of an open-source brand for the public, an ever-evolving work of art that extends beyond the crypto sphere. The Nouns Themed playground encapsulates our interpretation of the essence of Nouns, serving as a powerful catalyst for the creation of public goods.\n\n## The Disruption\nThese Nouns public infrastructures will have heavy Nouns aesthetic incoporated into their design. No, we are not talking about slapping noggle onto readily available play structures; rather, we meticulously design and construct each one from the ground up. \n\n\nThe aim of this themed playground will be, first and foremost, to influence at the same time increase Nouns brand recognition in the public eyes by infusing Nouns aesthetic into **PLACES** & **THINGS** strategically where everyone is able to interact with organically. \n\nThe themed playground will additionally foster conversations enable us to disrupt and challenge the norms, to provoke a shift on how establishments & individual perceive cc0 assets such as Nouns. Consequently, allow Nouns community to sprout new positive-sum initiatives / co-creation. \n\nTo ultimately increase utilization of Nouns assets, harnesses its potential as an infinite canvas, innovate & co-create more public goods.

Additionally, it also serve the purpose of promoting the public good purpose for Nouns. \n\nWith content in hand, we will be able to seed our message surrounding Nouns Themed playground, a physical Nounish public infrastructure to media partners within our network who share our enthusiasm for portraying Nouns' values and ethos, thereby generating constructive coverage. Furthermore, we are able to leverage on Element 6's exisiting social media partners to bring on more attention to this thematic playground boosting the playground's visibility.\n\nIf supported, this documentary can be proposed as a Droposal to Nouns where a portion of the proceed from Droposal can be allocated to support public good-oriented Prop House round, with the remaining proceed directed back to Nouns DAO.  \n  \n## Budget\n\n### **Allocation**\nThe total proposed budget is 635,000 USDC for 6mths duration, with an allocation as follows:\n\n**1.

Our foremost objective is to showcase the essence of Nouns and Nounish elements to their fullest within this thematic playground.\n\n**Directing of Documentary**\nWe'll also be coordinating with a film crew to craft a captivating documentary that effectively narrates the story of Nouns through the lens of Nouns themed playground; providing a lore for communities memember to tap onto for future co-creation globally.\n\n**Liaison and Outreach**\nIn addition, we will leverage our extensive network, relationships and knowledge, utilizing the realzation of Nouns Themed Playground as a catalyze allowing us to further expand Nouns' network value.

Noun's Bidet Revolution!** \n# TLDR\nMakeWater is seeking $34,000 USDC to provide low-income families with Nouns-branded bidets, educate the community on their benefits, and produce high-quality video content showcasing the initiative.\n\n# Summary \n\nWith a $34,000 proposal, MakeWater aims to shift U.S. bathroom culture by promoting bidets, a net positive for the environment and households. Bidets can slash toilet paper costs, boost hygiene, and ease water infrastructure stress. Our pilot will provide Nouns-branded bidets to low-to-middle-income families, complete with DIY installation videos. \nThe initiative involves an educational drive where students, acting as citizen scientists, gather and share data on bidet usage and delve into water issues in their region. This hands-on approach also includes field trips to local water facilities, providing them with a comprehensive understanding of bidet advantages. By partnering with water utilities and local governments, we envision a self-sustaining model, continually championing bidet use. \nAs this initiative grabs headlines, Nouns will stand out as the pioneering force behind it. Your support will be the kickstart we need!\n\n**Update** We‚Äôve updated the proposal after listening to feedback and reduced the initial ask, explained our goal for a self-sustained program (no future nouns funding required), and highlighted how Nouns will be seen as the hero catalyzing this revolutionary change in bathroom culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How will it work?\n[![Screen Shot 2023-09-20 at 10.20.35 AM|690x388](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/original/1X/64fdc44ca71b4895023689cf724500b0b393e1b8.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o)\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o)\n\nOur  journey will start with our pilot program in South Texas which will be a pivotal step for data collection, refining strategies, and pinpointing best practices. We are delighted to have already gained the enthusiastic support and active engagement of local utilities and educators,  who will propel the growth of our community and our vision.\nThrough our ongoing community-building efforts, we will strive to gather a strong initial group of participants in South Texas, our pilot region. Far from being just beneficiaries, these participants will become pioneers, actively contributing to data collection and shaping a communal narrative through social media engagement. These authentic stories, personal experiences and testimonials,  will initiate a cultural shift towards bidet use and create a united front against water wastage.\nThe Nouns DAO can kickstart this effort, providing the initial push needed to get the ball rolling. But this isn't just a one-time splash; it's a tide of transformation! The real heart of this initiative is its ability to keep going on its own. Our goal is more than just handing out affordable bidets; it's about making a lasting change in how people use bathrooms in America.\nThis initiative will be a wave of change that keeps building and reaching farther. Our pilot program marks the first splash, but together, we have the power to reshape perspectives, enhance water sustainability, and fundamentally revolutionize water habits across the United States.\n\n**Want a Limited Edition Golden Nouns Bidet ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®?** \nDonate 0.05 ETH or more at  [https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592](https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592).\nAll contributions further our mission, and as a token of our appreciation, you'll receive the exclusive bidet.\n\n\n# Why Bidets?\nEnter the humble toilet-mounted bidet ‚Äî a nifty contraption that adds a touch of luxury to your bathroom routine. It replaces or fits beneath the toilet seat and uses a a nozzle to spray water for cleansing. Its installation is easy and doesn't demand a plumbing professional. Many models even showcase features like adjustable pressure, temperature control, and self-cleaning. Beyond all that, however, lies an ecological marvel‚Äî a cost-effective solution that promotes better hygiene while reducing toilet paper waste.\n\nBidets have garnered worldwide recognition for their remarkable water-saving abilities and paper-reducing magic. Embracing bidets translates to preserving trees, conserving water, and reducing the energy dedicated to manufacturing and transporting toilet paper.\n\nTheir appeal isn't just environmental; it's also rooted in hygiene. Bidets offer hands-free, pristine cleanliness, an invaluable health advantage, especially in a time when global health awareness is at its peak.\n\nOur aging water infrastructure poses yet another challenge. Sewage systems of many cities groan under the weight of non-degradable items. These infrastructures were designed for a different era, and non-degradable products like wet wipes weren't part of the plan. Despite their convenience, wipes don't break down in water like toilet paper does. This leads to stubborn blockages, damages to equipment, and ultimately, significant repair costs that households and communities have to bear.\n\nBidets, however, offer a sustainable lifeboat. By adopting bidets, we curtail clogs and damages, sparing households and cities from hefty repair costs. It's not just a bathroom upgrade; it's a blueprint for economic resilience, environmental harmony, and public health.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Our Background\n[![Screen Shot 2023-09-20 at 10.20.35 AM|690x388](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/original/1X/4d1175bec0882ed790ebee5f64ef9998d4ab6125.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE)\n[Video of our Lil Nouns Water Purification Kits built in partnership with the Light House for the Blind Nonprofit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE)\n![79685689a8627fcb69f5c7a138529474869a119a_2_1034x748|690x499](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/optimized/1X/79685689a8627fcb69f5c7a138529474869a119a_2_1034x748.jpeg)\nLil Nouns Kits at our Black Girls Code Event in Houston. \n\n![|217x384](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/S_Kp1aNv2LHDB43Vd7I0bRW3nyPCIiP2lVjTWbgxXiDGTn70Y_I0Se93u0w_tHlnoWD1LzBKB4_w7iqBBz-8_Ogbj9kYiRXvt1rOCAVEyVv9r_UjpoFAu0OBOYZCEgScAS1bb44qldiFXtw4YtwVXWI)\n\n*View MakeWater Endaoment Donation History https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592\n* In June 2022, Lil Nouns passed our 3,000 nouns kits for students proposal by a resounding 211 to 4 vote (‚û°Ô∏èsee [here](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/16)).\n* We teamed up with Lighthouse for the Blind to create these kits, and we marked our partnership with a video (‚û°Ô∏èwatch it[ here](https://youtu.be/0thwr7QItyE)).\n* Our victory streak continued with a win at the FoodNouns Prop, where our proposal to create video vignette for our water education curriculum (click to watch our video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYrK_6Y_qUU), ‚û°Ô∏èand check out our [tweet](https://twitter.com/makewaterorg/status/1659299148066177024?s=20)) garnered unanimous support (‚û°Ô∏èsee our %100 positive votes in [here](https://www.foodnouns.wtf/vote/3)).\n* We‚Äôve also received a positive response Lil Nouns PropHouse (Open Round 12) for our proposal asking Lil Nouns to be a 3D printer prize sponsor for World Water Day youth competition (‚û°Ô∏èsee [here](https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-12-open/3649)).\n* Nounish Team also highlighted our work on World Water Day, with a reel showcasing our work and our ongoing partnership with the community (‚û°Ô∏èsee [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/4rzK2iCFoWA?feature=share)).\n* Beyond our cherished Nouns community, our network encompasses educators, water utilities, and beyond.

With contracts built by Wilson, Propdates is the best way to keep up with Nouns proposals after they pass, and an entirely new design space within the greater Nouns ecosystem. We‚Äôve never had any consistent, onchain way to keep track of contributors‚Äô work, and no way to recommend regular updates. Down the line, one could imagine Propdates as an onchain oracle for proposal progress.\n\n## PROGRESS SO FAR\nI built the Propdates site and public graph, inspired by Krel‚Äôs [requests.wtf](http://requests.wtf). What started as a weekend experiment has grown into something much bigger: it‚Äôs clear that we‚Äôve tapped into something special. In fact, Propdates has already become part of the pre-proposal conversation process - it is expected that a proposer regularly updates the DAO on their work. In just a few weeks, we already have had 17 unique posters, and more coming.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/mt9nCgz/metrics.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/CzXyQrg/other.png)\n\n## LOOKING AHEAD\nWe‚Äôd like to move Propdates from an experiment to a fully-featured Nouns app and a key part of the ecosystem, on par with teams like Agora, Federation, Prop House. Our end goal is for Propdates to be a protocol any contract or app can plug into to determine a proposal‚Äôs success. It is clear that it could expand further than just Nouns.\n\nWe are asking for three months of funding (more on the team below). Martin will be close to full-time, but working on other projects as well (similar to almost all software proposers). We expect Onion to be part time for two months or so. For these months, our priorities will be:\n1.  Contract improvements to expand functionality  & data\n\t- New channels to post updates in: prop house entries, user channels, custom channels\n\t- Revamped admin system / permissions + ‚ÄúSuper Admin‚Äù to unlock proposals where proposer is unresponsive\n\t- Explore contract to update/revoke streams based on a proposal's updates\n2.  Improved editor, claiming and submitting UX\n\t- Easy image upload via Arweave or IPFS (and potentially expand as a public good for Nouns ecosystem)\n\t- In-app markdown editor and previews for better UX\n3.  Farcaster integration for likes & comments on updates\n4.  Open Editions to celebrate Completed Props\n\nOur goals by January 31st, 2024 are:\n-   150 proposals marked as completed\n-   400 updates posted\n-   30 weekly updates on average\n\nAdditionally, we want to encourage past proposals to share updates on their work, but recognize it‚Äôs often hard for contributors to track down their sponsoring proposers (pre-v3). We are requesting 0.05 ETH to send to each of the first 100 successful props (before prop #363) that posts a non-trivial update as an incentive to kickstart the protocol. At the time of writing there have been 225 successful proposals, so this would go a long way to getting all proposals marked as completed.\n\n## TEAM\n\n-   [martin](https://twitter.com/anquetil) worked on [Mogu](http://nouns.wtf/vote/321), [Explorer Grants](http://nouns.wtf/vote/178), [Hack Week](http://nouns.wtf/vote/253)\n-   [onnnnnnnion](https://twitter.com/onnnnnnnion) (solidity) worked on [BLOCKS](https://mint.fun/zora/0x1F781d47cD59257D7AA1Bd7b2fbaB50D57AF8587), [onions renderer](https://twitter.com/onnnnnnnion/status/1639045062595170307), [PH Infinite Round Committee](https://prop.house/infinite/nouns-retro-grants)\n\n## FUNDING\n-   Team: 30 ETH for three months (via Stream)\n-   Incentives: 5 ETH (100 * 0.05 ETH)\n-   OpEx: 2 ETH\n \nWe commit to posting updates on [updates.wtf](https://updates.wtf) bi-weekly to keep the community updated on our progress.

Our new audience is highly engaged and consists primarily of artists, designers and other creative types from around the world.   Our goal in season 3 is to 10X our followers from 80K to 800K in 6 months with $969K in funding.\n\n----\n\n## Who are we\n\nWe are nounish, a team funded three times by Nouns DAO ([pilot](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/64), [season 1](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/143), & [season 2](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/289)). We started as a marketing studio for the DAO, producing dozens of videos about Nouns-funded projects, including the [11 minute explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa79nN4gMPs) on [nouns.wtf](https://nouns.wtf), as well as videos about [Gnars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQSmfSnRGVk), [Free Glasses for Kids](https://x.com/nounish/status/1601906808716566530?s=20), and most recently, [Mucho Love](https://twitter.com/nounish/status/1675846336909033472) & [Esports](https://twitter.com/nounsesports/status/1694196803015479399).\n\nWe are a team of 10 who transformed our commercial production company, [Pixel](https://pixel.melbourne), to focus full-time on Nouns, and we are based in Melbourne, Australia. We are led by [Goldy](https://twitter.com/Goldypix) & [142](https://twitter.com/noun142) ‚Äìtwo Nouners, and early community members.\n\n----\n\n## Season 2: The Quest for PMF\n\nThe content we produced up to the beginning of season 2 was highly useful for explaining Nouns to the world and resonated well with Nouns enthusiasts and their networks on Crypto Twitter, and has been cited by Nouners, builders, and fans as their gateway into the ecosystem. But in season 2, responding to [feedback from our last proposal](https://www.voter.wtf/?proposalid=289&proposalId=289), we set out to find PMF and distribution beyond the existing Nouns community. We wanted our content to resonate with a clearly defined audience that was large enough to have a significant impact on Nouns.\n\nSo we developed a framework to test  hypotheses for different audiences and content, and in our recent [proposal update](https://www.updates.wtf/prop/289), we go into details on the different tests we ran.\n\n---\n\n## Finding PMF\nThree months into our testing, we created a hit with our new reality TV-style concept, \"3 Artists, 1 Noun.\" The show features a short and playful competition between three world-class artists to create a new piece of art inspired by the day‚Äôs noun within just five hours.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b46zY6k.jpg)\n\nThe show quickly became popular on Instagram, with the top episode receiving over 1 million organic views. We have released eight episodes so far, which have received over 2 million views and brought us over 70,000 new followers.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KhoDu0v.gif)\n\n\nOther signs of PMF include a very high engagement rate: our top episode got 140,000 likes (a 14% like/view ratio), and every episode receives hundreds of comments, saves, and shares.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SpVe7hi.gif)\n\n\n---\n\n## Our Audience\nThe audience that the show is attracting is consistently identifiable as what we call \"The Creatives.\" Our followers are designers, artists, creative directors, filmmakers, animators, illustrators, and so on. We also have attracted some well known brands in the creative sector, including [Wacom](https://www.instagram.com/wacom) and [Artlist](https://www.instagram.com/artlist.io).\n\nWe see this as a chance to build a community outside the crypto bubble that is a perfect fit for Nouns, a group of talented and inspired creative people.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/k2yxgRA.jpg)\n\n\n---\n\n## More Than Growth: A Relationship With Our Audience\n\nBy turning the camera back on ourselves we are making ourselves a tangible representation of the Nounish values they can relate to ‚Äì joyous, welcoming, playful, creative, and collaborative.  \n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dPMAnxm.gif)\n\n\n\n\nAs we share our inspiring culture (one completely in line with Nouns' own values) our audience will grow to love the show and the people on it. And in the long term, as the connection between us and our audience deepens, we give ourselves the best chance to galvanise them to engage with Nouns in a more meaningful way.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UONjU3I.jpg)\n\n---\n\n\n## Season 3: 10X again\n\nIn season 3, our goal is to 10X our audience again from 80K to 800K followers in 6 months.\n\n**How will we achieve this?**\n\n* Double down on 3 Artists and keep on iterating to reach tens of millions of people\n* Develop new content that will resonate with our community\n* Experiment with new formats (e.g. length of show) to breakout on YouTube\n\n---\n\n## Longer term\n\nOver the next few years, we will reach tens of millions of people and build a massive followership via content that engages, entertains, inspires, and educates about Nouns. We think nounish can help build the distribution Nouns needs to reach mass market. We are fired up and excited to build this and to bring Nouns mainstream!\n\n---\n\n## Our Ask\nWe are asking the same budget from the past two seasons: $969,000 USD\nFor the same amount of time: 6 months.\n\n## Transactions\n* 30% up front ($290K USDC)\n* 70% streaming over 6 months from December 17, 2023 to June 17, 2024 ($679K USDC)"},{"blockNumber":18371195,"blockHash":"0xcccb199b3e7ba7f98985e5f28d65202da94ce51717cf44f087af5739c561b8da","transactionIndex":158,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0xcb30ab2d8d35a67acfa776892aa15dcb07e6d47fe5edaa74dc3516c0d56032db","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":414,"proposer":"0xF952A0788137Cef8Cba0B315a042262Ddc12c3aF","signers":["0x2666f0C8FB58d182f2Dd79475DCA4A07B3724607"],"targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000001cd2f6a466e12136a9e0b691bf86b0ca5f7a70ec0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001176592e00"],"startBlock":18392795,"endBlock":18421595,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18389195,"proposalThreshold":0,"quorumVotes":34,"description":"# One Noun, Every Day, Forever... in an Action Rogue-Lite Game!\n\n# PROPOSAL\n![NounsTown Promo](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Ff8c8617c-3190-4fc4-8dcc-2b088b4fd397%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=4e47bfa8-37e1-4112-bde8-7b1e0b996a25&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\nPlay as ***One Noun, Every Day, Forever***, in an action rogue-lite game developed in collaboration with ***Nouns*** and ***Forgotten Runes Wizard‚Äôs Cult*** to be released on ***Steam/PC!***\n\n###### TL;DR\nWe are asking for ***$75,000*** ***to fund the first 3-months of production*** for our indie Nouns game.  Check out our playable demo here (use Safari for MacOS users):\n[NounsTown Demo](https://thepixelshop.itch.io/nounstown-demo)\n\n\n# PROLIFERATION\nOur proposal aims to proliferate Nouns by focusing on a ***specific target market of the PC gaming community*** that is interested in indie games, specifically ***the rogue-lite genre***.  A rogue-lite indie game provides a compelling opportunity for Nouns to enter the gaming sector due to the following reasons:\n\n##### Rising Popularity\n- Indie developers have had incredible success in recent years due to their ability to design ***innovating*** and ***creative*** new games that AAA studios often avoid\n- Developers have gained access to multiple ***mass distribution platforms*** such as Steam, Nintendo Switch, Itch.io, and Epic Games to reach a wide audience\n- Available resources and advancements in game development have provided a landscape for small teams, or even individual developers, to produce games with a ***powerful cultural impact and longevity***\n\n##### Lower Risk Entry to Gaming\n- We conceptualized the game design to ensure as much value and ***replay-ability*** while maintaining a ***reasonable scope*** of work and ***longer-term scalability***\n- Our proposal provides for a ***phased funding and development approach*** to ensure a ***transparent production*** process, opportunities to receive ***community feedback***, and provide multiple ***tiers of content***\n- We will use ***Steam as our distribution platform*** to launch the game; however, we will explore porting the game to Nintendo Switch after the initial launch and financial considerations\n\n##### The Charm of Pixel Art\n- Our art team collectively has over ***30 years of pixel art experience*** and will design a game aesthetic that will resonate with indie gamers and pixel art enthusiasts\n- Pixel art games have had tremendous success with nearly ***13,000 games available on Steam.***  Some household names including Stardew Valley, Shovel Knight, Celeste, Terraria, Hyper Light Drifter, Enter the Gungeon, Octopath Traveler, and Baba is You\n- Our game will showcase many different pixel art styles including our ***modern aesthetic gameplay, retro style UI and game map, and high resolution portraits***\n\n##### Creative Commons\n- All of the ***art and animations*** that we produce during development will be ***open-source*** and available to the community to use!\n- ***After development***, we will ***consider making the game open-source*** to collaborate with game developers and artists to contribute new content\n\n# GAME OVERVIEW\n##### Game Engine\nThe game will be developed using ***Godot 4***, a free and open-source game development engine!  \n\n##### Genre\n**Rogue-Lite**\nThe key feature of a Rogue-Lite genre is a game loop that results in ***permadeath***.  Each time a player begins their attempt or run, they will either defeat the final boss or die trying.  A Rogue-Lite game generally involves some ***permanent progression*** that takes place ***outside of the run***; usually in the form of upgraded weapons, statistics, abilities, or skill trees.\n\n**Bullet Hell**\nBullet Hell combat mechanics emphasize ***complex bullet patterns*** for the player to navigate and dodge.  Our bullet hell game will be designed as a twin stick shooter where the player is on a ***flat plane with a top-down perspective***.  They will then use one joystick to control the player and the other joystick to control the direction of shooting, or for the real ones, mouse for shooting and keyboard for movement!\n\n**Non-Linear Progression**\nOne of the unique selling points of our Rogue-Lite game is that it will have Non-Linear progression.  The two main features to highlight in this design include a ***unique map that is generated each run*** and the freedom for the player to ***decide their order of progression***.    Each location will have distinct characteristics that the Player may take advantage of depending on their weapon selection and upgrade composition.  \n\n**Inspiration**\n[Enter the Gungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/), [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/), [Risk of Rain 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/), [Nuclear Throne](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/Nuclear_Throne/), [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/)\n\n\n##### Story\nWelcome to the world of ***Nouns Town***, a charming community nestled amidst pixelesque landscapes.

Nouns Town desperately needs a hero to put an end to the invasion!\n\n##### Primary Game Mode: One Noun, Every Day, Forever\n- Play as a new Nouns character every rolling 24-hour period beginning with Noun #1 and all Nouns that follow\n- Every player will attempt the daily run with the same weapon, world map, upgrade choices, and enemy spawns\n- The map seed will change each day along with the playable character\n- Compete against all other players on the leaderboard for the fastest clear time\n- All daily winners will secure their place in the game‚Äôs history!\n\n![A Noun A Day Promo](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Febdf3ba8-dbc9-460f-8931-857889572ea5%2Fstage_nouns_v_souls.png?table=block&id=cbaa22ac-9c9d-4d42-856c-64c595492dde&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Traditional Game Mode: Protonoun\n**Play as the Protonoun in a traditional rogue-lite game mode**\n- Select your starting weapon and begin your run in a unique generative map\n- Gain Upgrades as you progress through each room of enemies\n- Search for two hidden keys to unlock each stage Boss\n- Encounter NPCs and Events as you explore the map\n- Complete achievements during your run to unlock new content\n- Defeat the final boss, the Lich King, to beat the game\n\n![The Protocave](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F91f59fde-3358-41dc-8a8a-14f1721c4141%2Fprotocave.png?table=block&id=dd19d7a6-e01a-4bd6-86b1-838af593bf3d&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Weapons\n\nThe player will begin each run by selecting a single weapon type.

All minions will be designed to have a diverse range of attack styles and bullet patterns.  Early attack style concepts include melee, burst range, sniper range, summoners, and complex bullet patterns for elite minions.  \n\nWe will use rare NFTs from the Forgotten Souls collection as our Stage Bosses and the Lich King as our final boss.  Our first Boss engagement will be designed and implemented in Phase I of production.\n\n**Sample** **Minion Designs:**\n![Minion Concepts](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Fed2d7a9a-3f76-484b-9c3b-a8bef7f00f4a%2Fminions.png?table=block&id=c90faec9-9a19-40dc-9b9a-aeab46b202ab&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Map and Room Design\n\nWith the game‚Äôs setting taking place in Nouns Town, our protagonist will progress through the map to clear each location of the Forgotten Souls.

The design will have the following characteristics:\n\n**Unique Generative Maps**\n\n- Each run will generate a new Nouns Town map seed with approximately 30 - 45 Locations, 2 Stage Boss chambers, and 1 Final Boss chamber\n- The Player will have the freedom to decide which locations to clear first\n\n**NPC and Event Rooms**\n\n- We will include friendly NPCs and locations to provide healing, potential upgrades, and/or narrative progression\n- Additionally, we are exploring various Event Rooms that occur random times throughout each run that provide new challenges for the player\n\n**Room Architecture**\n\n- We will design a large library of Locations and Rooms that the map generator will pull from to maintain a unique and diverse world for each play through\n- Room types within each location will have consistent thematic designs to provide new challenges and allow the player to associate location aesthetics to gameplay characteristics\n\n**Room Decorations**\n\n- We will produce a library of tile sets, decorations, barriers, and destructible objects to fill each room with a fun and unique personality inspired by Nouns\n- We will mix and match each room‚Äôs architecture to various aesthetics to give each room a unique personality and provide diversity between each run\n\n**Sample assets:**\n![Tile Set Preview](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F440c398d-3d22-4e10-93c7-1ed447b2e1ca%2Ftileset_sample.png?table=block&id=7419a6e2-cfd2-4208-9a47-5d3715964af5&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Sound Design\n\nFull sound design will include sound effects and an original soundtrack.

Held at the Melbourne Convention Exhibition Centre, this event has touched the lives of over 165,000 children since its inception in 1986. The massive event is completely FREE for 5,000 children and 3,000 carers to attend, ensuring that each child receives a gift and experiences an inclusive day of fun, activities, stage entertainment, carnival rides, all-abilities sport and an all-important visit from Santa. For many, this celebration is the only one they have during the Christmas season, and the gifts they receive at the party are often the only ones they receive. The Variety Kids Xmas Party is a safe space for children living with disabilities or experiencing disadvantage or illness, allowing them to be themselves without fear of judgment from their peers. This remarkable event is made possible by the dedication and hard work of the small Variety team and over 600 volunteers.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkJSDa1xp.jpg)\n\n\n### ‚åê‚óß-‚óß Profound Impact:\nThe Variety Kids Xmas Party is more than just a day of fun; it&#39;s a lifeline for families who often feel isolated or overlooked. For many children, the event offers a rare opportunity to experience joy, laughter, and a sense of belonging. Parents often remark on the transformative effect of the party, noting the boost in their children's confidence and self-esteem. The ripple effect extends beyond the children to their families, providing them with a much-needed respite and the chance to see their children thrive in a supportive environment. The memories created during the party serve as a source of strength and inspiration for families throughout the year.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkJ5cjkxT.jpg)\n\n### ‚åê‚óß-‚óß Testimonials:\n\"You have no idea what this means to us.

It serves as a day of joy and inclusion, often providing the only Christmas celebration and gifts these children receive. For over three decades, this event has been sustained by year-round contributions from our dedicated individual of donors and fundraisers.\n\nThe current cost-of-living crisis has intensified the needs of our most vulnerable families, increasing the demand for our support. Simultaneously, community donations have become less frequent, as they are no longer as possible for some individuals as they once were.\n\nIf the Nouns prop passes to fund the 2023 event, the money previously allocated for it will be redirected to our individual grant program, which provides essential items like wheelchairs, communication devices, scholarships, education programs and assistance dogs for kids experiencing disadvantage or living with conditions including Cerebral Palsy, Down Syndrome, Autism, global development delay, muscular dystrophy, brain\ninjury, spinal injury, rare and chronic disease and more.\n\nVariety ‚Äì the Children‚Äôs Charity requests a total of ~USDC 47,479 (28.99 ETH) to fund the Nouns brand fun and entertainment zones.

We seek Nouns DAO's support of 47,479 UDSC to enhance this iconic event, held across 39,000 square metres, with the Nouns bringing the FUN and ENTERTAINMENT, ensuring a memorable experience for all attendees including:\n* 5,000 kids in need\n* 3,000 parents and carers\n* 600 corporate volunteers\n* 100 VIP guests\n\nThis year's party will be held in mid-December 2023.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SybKqjyga.jpg)\n\n### ‚åê‚óß-‚óß Background:\nFor over three decades, the Variety Kids Xmas Party has been a beacon of hope for kids in need. Held at the Melbourne Convention Exhibition Centre, this event has touched the lives of over 165,000 children since its inception in 1986. The massive event is completely FREE for 5,000 children and 3,000 carers to attend, ensuring that each child receives a gift and experiences an inclusive day of fun, activities, stage entertainment, carnival rides, all-abilities sport and an all-important visit from Santa. For many, this celebration is the only one they have during the Christmas season, and the gifts they receive at the party are often the only ones they receive. The Variety Kids Xmas Party is a safe space for children living with disabilities or experiencing disadvantage or illness, allowing them to be themselves without fear of judgment from their peers. This remarkable event is made possible by the dedication and hard work of the small Variety team and over 600 volunteers.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkJSDa1xp.jpg)\n\n\n### ‚åê‚óß-‚óß Profound Impact:\nThe Variety Kids Xmas Party is more than just a day of fun; it&#39;s a lifeline for families who often feel isolated or overlooked. For many children, the event offers a rare opportunity to experience joy, laughter, and a sense of belonging. Parents often remark on the transformative effect of the party, noting the boost in their children's confidence and self-esteem. The ripple effect extends beyond the children to their families, providing them with a much-needed respite and the chance to see their children thrive in a supportive environment. The memories created during the party serve as a source of strength and inspiration for families throughout the year.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkJ5cjkxT.jpg)\n\n### ‚åê‚óß-‚óß Testimonials:\n\"You have no idea what this means to us. Without Variety, we were having no Christmas.\" Kayla\n\n‚ÄúBeing on your own and battling to afford the basics, you are so conscious of trying to make Christmas special. I will be forever thankful that Variety did that for me and my boys this Christmas.‚Äù Shelly, parent of Jaxon and Dylan.\n\nTo make the day even more special, each child receives a gift bag full of age-appropriate toys and games (including Nounish items) to take home and enjoy. For some children, this was the only gift they received that Christmas.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryvQ5jklT.jpg)\n\n\n### ‚åê‚óß-‚óß Videos and imagery:\n\nWatch the party in action ‚Äì news coverage of last year's event \n[7 News Click here to play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8bpybGRlZY&themeRefresh=1)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H17HSTyea.png)\n\n[9 News Click here to play ](https://youtu.be/GXfgo3frPww)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJx9B6yxa.png)\n\nMeet some of the families who attend and hear what it means to them \n[Click here to watch Seth & Teagan's Variety Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhk80WxPSyk)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1gBLaJea.png)\n\n**Click here to view our gallery** of [pictures of the day](https://photos.app.goo.gl/GATPZpPnU5TEy7nTA) \n\n\n### ‚åê‚óß-‚óß A Nounish Christmas Deliverables:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1AOkl6x6.png)\n\n\nTo elevate the 2023 Variety Kids Xmas Party, we propose the Nouns brand activations in synchronicity with the Variety red branding where Nouns bring the FUN and ENTERTAINMENT!

On average, previous Xmas Parties have cost USD $160,000 and have been funded from Variety's non-profit funds.\n\nVariety is committed to continue to fund this event with the knowledge that it is crucial for thousands of families whose children are living with disabilities, illnesses, or experiencing disadvantages. It serves as a day of joy and inclusion, often providing the only Christmas celebration and gifts these children receive. For over three decades, this event has been sustained by year-round contributions from our dedicated individual of donors and fundraisers.\n\nThe current cost-of-living crisis has intensified the needs of our most vulnerable families, increasing the demand for our support. Simultaneously, community donations have become less frequent, as they are no longer as possible for some individuals as they once were.\n\nIf the Nouns prop passes to fund the 2023 event, the money previously allocated for it will be redirected to our individual grant program, which provides essential items like wheelchairs, communication devices, scholarships, education programs and assistance dogs for kids experiencing disadvantage or living with conditions including Cerebral Palsy, Down Syndrome, Autism, global development delay, muscular dystrophy, brain\ninjury, spinal injury, rare and chronic disease and more.\n\nVariety ‚Äì the Children‚Äôs Charity requests a total of USDC 47,479 to fund the Nouns brand fun and entertainment zones. Variety will be contributing the balance of event costs as outlined in our budget section funded by donors who contribute to our Christmas appeal and throughout the year.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryuBcikxp.jpg)\n\n\n**BUDGET**\n\n* Entertainment ‚Äì all on-stage performers, Santa, dancers, character performers such as the Grinch and Real Dinosaurs, carnival rides including a ferris wheel, sideshow alley, Santa‚Äôs grotto, all-abilities sports activations, silent movie cinema, and main stage visual, LED screens, audio, staging, stage lighting & rigging $32,511 USDC\n* Photography/filming and package creation $3,219 USDC\n* Nouns Noggles - donated $0 USDC\n* LEGO - donated $0 USDC\n* Colouring sheets - printing $645 USDC\n* Free standing foam Noggles sculpture $645 USDC\n* Nouns signage x 25 $804 USDC\n* Nouns character costume $4,506 USDC\n* 600 Nouns branded tees worn by corporate volunteers across the venue $3,862 USDC\n* 2,000 temporary Noggles tattoos $1,287 USDC\n* TOTAL $47,479 USDC\n\nIn addition, Variety will be paying USD $128k (funded across the year by our donors) as follows\n* Catering extras (90% catering sponsor)\t$7,443\n* Event management and non-main stage venue AV, staging & rigging\t$31,900\n* Venue hire cost\t$15,400\n* Gift bag of toys for every child\t$64,169\n* Transport, freight, couriers and postage \t$2,951\n* Staffing, logistics, and marketing\t$6,416\n\t\n    \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1L_0i1x6.jpg)\n\n\n### ‚åê‚óß-‚óß The Team\n**Georgie Smith - Variety Project Lead**\n[Georgie](https://https://twitter.com/RoxbySmith) has a twenty-five-year career in not-for-profit fundraising, marketing and event management and currently leads Variety ‚Äì the Children‚Äôs Charity digital innovation program including crypto philanthropy.

These three artists in particular were very early builders in the nouns ecosystem, all were members of the first group of Nouncillors, and all have openly helped others in the ecosystem to help proliferate Nouns.\n\n**Prop Inspiration:** Important note - this idea came from me not Mr. Boney, Messhup or Sidenoun. As I was reflecting on my own nounish journey, these three kept popping up in my story, sometimes in obvious ways, other times just in the background, but always there. There are so many others who have also made strong contributions and should be recognized as well but this seemed like a great place to start.\n\nI reached out to all three and confirmed they would accept a Noun if given the opportunity and all agreed to hold it for a minimum of one year since we do not yet have a vesting contract in place. (Actually each one said they'd never sell when asked.)\n\nAs long time contributors to the ecosystem, I can think of no better future Nouners.\n\n### Mr. Boney\n\nLaunching just a couple months after Nouns on October 10, 2021, **[The Boneys](https://opensea.io/collection/theboneys)** combined Nouns and Cryptoadz to create a new spooky take on cc0 art. The collection has some well known holders, among them [**David Horvath**](https://x.com/davidzhorvath/status/1448014564159799307?s=20) (a Boney whale) and Luca Netz. \n\nIn addition to The Boneys, Mr. Boney also created [**The Boney Bats**](https://opensea.io/collection/the-boney-batz), [**UniToadz**](https://opensea.io/collection/unitoadz), [**$PepeToadz**](https://opensea.io/collection/pepetoadz) and has contributed advice and assistance on numerous other projects including the [**Yellow Collective**](https://x.com/theboneys/status/1711251203093626976?s=20).\n\n \nThe Boneys continues to captivate and provide a unique character in the Nouniverse, recognized all on its own as well as part of the Nouns ecosystem, even finding its way to the NFT mural in NYC, the first piece of nounish art to do so.\n \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyjYkq4Gp.png)\n\n\n\n---\n\n### Messhup\n\nAt the core of almost every iconic piece of nounish art is Messhup, including pieces such as the **[Meta Noun Square](https://opensea.io/collection/the-meta-square-a-special-open-edition-by-messhup)**, the [**Rose Parade open edition**,](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x628d8222f064e3a29a69814bd13974b0160e8538) and **[the Nouniversary](https://opensea.io/collection/nounniversary-01)**, and the incredible nounish sails for NFT.NYC. Whenever a banger art piece is needed, Messhup is tapped and always over-delivers.\n\nBeyond these amazing individual pieces of nounish art, [**Messhup**](https://opensea.io/Messhup/created) has launched multiple cc0 collections of his own including PeeperToadz, [**Meme Seizer**](https://opensea.io/collection/meme-seizer), and [**Serial Collectors**](https://opensea.io/collection/serialcollectors).\n  \nAlso an original member of Nouncil, Messhup created the **[Nouncil logo](https://nouncil.wtf/)** and supports nounish builders with his art, even recently dropping a piece out of the blue to honor the **[Boneversary](https://x.com/messhup/status/1712625204684333166?s=20)**.\n\n ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1cZNqNfp.png)\n\n \n\n---\n\n### Sidenoun\n\nOne of the first recipients of a small grant from Nouns, Sidenoun launched the **[SideNoun](https://opensea.io/collection/sdn)** NFT project at the end of 2021 ‚Äì an art project of cute nouns with their shifty eyes and the tagline: isometric nouns, looking highly suspicious. **[I personally came in through the SideNoun door](https://https://paragraph.xyz/@nounishprof/sidenoun)**, where I first encountered David Horvath in the discord and he set me straight on nouns traits.

Distribution will be digital and physical, with plans for translation in 4 Languages. The project development will be shared through videos, live streams, and Open Editions, aiming for completion in 10-12 months.\n\n---\n\n## **A Graphic Novel (Vol 1)**.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkNjEYyzT.png)\n*Draft Cover/Poster*\n\nI‚Äôm targeting Graphic Novel readers (15+) who love both sci-fi and fantasy + adventure, usually read action-packed stories, but also love tech, and (included but not limited) are crypto users. The artwork will include concepts related to decentralization, blockchain, and internet technologies, and Nouns will be the characters that inhabit this universe.\n\nI firmly believe that we can find the right audience in Web3 at first, it‚Äôs an amazing niche to build a tech-oriented story and ultimately an onchain mythology, in which Nouns could be not only at the core of it but represent great values and a positive-sum culture.\n\nTo me, nouns are not only pixel characters, but something more, they are storytelling vehicles full of potential. And at the same time, there are dozens of small elements in our community lore to include in the story. \n\n---\n\n## **Evolution of the Nouns aesthetics (from my POV):**\nWe all love the original Nouns, they are perfect as the source material, but they are also really adaptable to using them in different styles.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyPczHAWa.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ-R9gHga.png)\n*The last two images are from April-June 2022.*\n\n In this world-building adventure, I've given the term \"Noun\" a fresh perspective, digging into its meaning both on the surface and at a deeper, symbolic level. This project isn't just about testing how Nouns look; it's also about spinning an engaging tale. We want to hook current Noun fans and introduce new readers to our world, even if they're not blockchain or DAO experts.\n \n---\n\n## **Distribution:**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJE-Pclfa.png)\nDraft Cover.\n\n**Digital First:**\nThe main distribution strategy will be online (Free download from the website, manga/comic reader apps like Comixology, Viz Media, Kindle, and P2P/torrents).\nMost of the dedicated comic reader apps have more than 500K users minimum, but in the case of bigger apps like Comixology or Viz Media, they have millions of users combined in both the App Store and Google Store.\n\n**Physical:**\nPhysical copies will be handled through Amazon (highly efficient, global coverage, and no upfront costs). Plus, in case we can make a deal with regional publishers, it's easy to shut down the distribution of a translated version directly on Amazon.\n\n\n**4 Languages:**\nEnglish, Spanish, Japanese, and French. \n\nI cannot emphasize enough the significance of translating the graphic novel. Translating the artwork can create opportunities for publication by one or multiple publishers in Europe, Asia, or North America. Since many major publishers prefer to review a complete work, and this being the first volume, it could serve as an ideal means to engage regional publishers worldwide.\n\n\n---\n\n## **Concept Art:**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJoFWSRZT.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJYtXrR-a.png)\n\n---\n## **Summary of the story (subject to changes):**\n\n\nMeet Shady, a Noun who doesn't quite fit the mold of an obedient or exemplary citizen in a world teeming with adventurers, mysteries, and high achievers. His existence is a quiet rebellion in a society that prizes conformity. However, it seems destiny, if it exists, has grander designs for Shady. His insatiable curiosity catapults him into the uncharted territories of unexplored worlds.\n\nAs Shady embarks on this enigmatic journey, it becomes clear that more than just his life is at stake. The fate of his entire kind rests on his shoulders, and time is of the essence. He's faced with a dilemma: will he seize this opportunity to change the course of history or let it slip through his fingers?\n\n\n\n## **Sample Pages**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryDRkBRWp.png)\n\n\n## **Characters from the first volume:**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk-7xu1zp.png)\n\n**Featuring the NounBots:**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJVbJ9xza.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1nzkqeMa.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkRmycgM6.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Building in Public + Key Milestones:**\n\nI‚Äôm also building a graphic style to present the development of the project to the public in a more entertaining way using videos and/or live streams. This way people can follow more closely the development of the graphic novel and can ask questions about nouns and their ecosystem.\n\nThe goal is to make 2 videos per week (1 to 2 hours each) showing the process of the Graphic Novel, the idea is to use Twitch or YouTube (ideally both).\nI can also use propdates.wtf to show the latest news of the prop and the Manga channel in Farcaster.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyO0trwWa.png)\n*This is a sample of how the videos could look like*.\n\n## Key Milestones:\n\n**Concept and Team (Months 1-3):**\nDevelop the storyline and artistic style.\nAssemble and prepare the creative team.\n\n**Production and Marketing (Months 4-10):**\nCreate the 64-page graphic novel while translating it into multiple languages.\nImplement marketing and promotion strategies on online platforms.\n\n**Distribution and Launch (Month 11-12):**\nPlan and execute the distribution strategy for both digital and physical copies.\nOfficially launch the graphic novel, including online and potentially in-person events.\n\n**Audience Engagement and Public Building (Ongoing):**\nContinuously engage with the community on various platforms.\nAdapt the project based on audience feedback and reception.\n\n**Global Expansion and Future Planning (Ongoing):**\nStart the conversations with external publishers to get the graphic novel.\nEvaluate the project's performance and plan for the next chapters.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByWvFmvG6.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Scope and Budget**:\nSince this is a graphic novel of 64 pages I will need around 10 to 12 months to finish it.\nThe ideal deadline would be the next Nouniversary and I‚Äôll push myself and the team involved to do so, but I‚Äôm organizing the dates including all the team efforts and the standard timeframes to make the deadline more realistic so it could be released in October/November next year.\n\n---\n\n## **Budget Breakdown:**\n\n- **Preproduction -

Episode 2 will also be the first multi-client droposal in collaboration with Nounsagora. Droposal will come soon.*\n\n### Tl;dr:\nThis specific prop is seeking funding to create **Episode 3, 4 & 5 with a run-time of 10.5-11 mins each** delivered within 240 days.\n\n#### What is Atrium?\nAtrium is a crypto-native network of independent artists and creators. Disciplines represented on Atrium currently include Screenwriting, Animation, Concept Art, VFX, Voice Actors, and Music production. Together, creatives on Atrium bring the best ranging experiences from **Pixar, Marvel, Luma Pictures, Sony, Netflix & many more.**\n\n---\n### Proposal Ask:\n 1,125,000 (375K X 3) USD for a time-period of 240 days.\n\n> Note: *Ask is following the funding breakdown shared in the original kick-off [proposal 245](https://nouns.wtf/vote/245).*  \n\n#### Proposal timeline progress\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/wBLDJgz6/3244.png)\n\n#### Why Ask for 3 episodes at once?\n- Working on 3 month-long milestones at a time was tuned in to showcase proof-of-work to DAO and drive accountability forward.\n\n\n- Since then [Nouns Movie](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie) team has led by example, on what it means to be transparent in production process and keeping community at large in the loo.\n\n\n- What we realised however, this introduced inefficiency in securing long-term senior talent to be available to work on the film as they have no guarantee on whether they will still be working on the film after 3 months (*for e.g. followup proposals not passing*). We are often competing against traditional studio contracts for senior talent.\n  \n- Funding 3 episodes upfront will enable us to introduce batching of tasks for pre-production and animation, making the process much more predictable to manage. \n\n\n- More funding committed for the film will enable us to pre-empt discussions with distribution partners who will have a clearer picture of financing on the project and high likelihood of it being fully completed once they commit.\n\n---\n#### Where will the funds go to?\n- **Story and Scripting** for the Episode 3, 4 & 5 \n- **Preview Work in Progress and BTS** delivered through out the proposal duration\n- **Finished Episode 3,4 & 5** - delivered by 240 days time period.\n- Propdates published all along the way.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r19IfQTw3.png)\n\n\nAs we continue production, the timeline becomes more efficient and shrinks, ultimately leading us to the film conclusion. \n\n#### Kickoff Notes for EP3 onwards\n- After Episode 2 release, the team will be on a short hiatus for the rest of November (2 weeks).\n- Team ramps back up slowly throughout month of December and sporadic availability due to holiday month.\n- Expected to fully iron out EP3 script during this time period.\n- Team back at full capacity starting January and full production loop resumes. \n---\n\n### Recap and Progress Updates so far\nYou can follow Ep2 Propdates [here](https://www.updates.wtf/prop/317). \n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/2/2415348f7943c8a429024b648b3eb68b24a0d7fa_2_1380x862.jpeg)\n\n**Tl;dr:** Its bolder, bigger and better! \n\n\n#### Cast Announcements so far\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1zVh9NsW/19.png)\n\n- [Elijah Fox](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1701347725407838288) (Voice of Gi)\n- [Lisa Stanley](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1656100844763496448) (Voice of Mrs Waxman)\n- [Ray Hurd](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1710009700341928121) (Voice of Go)\n- [Cesar Romero](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1711863323967578591) (Voice of Leader blunt)\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/253cSV1K/environment-factory-hallyway.png)\n#### Behind the Scenes\n- [Discourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E_7XtzU47c&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation) with the directors : How Nouns Movie enabled them to do something unthinkable, completely remotely.\n- Understanding the intricacies of Blus [Musical Score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4OavIimoXs&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation).\n- Fun Trivia about the world [sound design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7umbTCiMTmk&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation) with Jordan - our SFX Lead.\n\n#### First Casting call\n- Casting call complete. 15 characters from other Nouns-values aligned communities were selected to make cameo appearances through out the Episode 2.\nhttps://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1686797509765840896\n- We intend to do more of these along to way opening the world of Blus outwards for others to participate in.\n\n#### Team Expansion Announcements\n- Dan Waters\nhttps://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1693785090340643078\n\n\n### DApp / UI Updates\n- **Nouns.Movie** was created to publish the story (dedicated webapp built with minting UX on top of Zora & cumulative leaderboard built-in)\n- Added Multi-episode support. \n- Introduced Worldview mints: Inexpensive art mints from different locations from the world of Blus that adds to cumulative ranking on the leaderboard.\n- Dedicated Behind the scenes section for audience to watch and explore auxillary content.\n- Planned token-gating for streaming content.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1Xd6YyB7/11111.png)\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/fTsHzvSg/2222.png)\n\n---\n\n### Story Updates\n**Genre**: Action, Comedy\n\nScript for the delivered Episode 2 can be found [***here***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gdInCNXaLvKA5Vrxe6aCTiOtE67jNpG6/view?usp=sharing)\n\n*We also created a rough outline of how the story progresses through completion.

Designed to be worn day and night, it reaches places that the Noggles glasses can't. This watch represents a powerful demonstration of what the Nouns community can achieve, extending the brand's narrative into an entirely new realm of self-expression. It seamlessly combines nounishness and horology, on the verge of becoming **the most personal and novel product Nouns has ever created**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PleFEx9.png)\n## The NounsWatch cc0 design: accessible to everyone\n\nCreated by renowned watch designer Rafael Miranda, the bold Noggle-inspired design is **half a watch and half a ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®**, literally. And like all nounish things should be, it‚Äôs cc0!\n\n\n\nIt's as much about functionality as it is about meticulous attention to detail. It features an exquisite *mysterious hours* full day half display, with a glass mirror and a black dial. The hour and minute handles are individual pieces that combines every hour to form the Noggles symbol. On the NounsWatch, **every hour is Noun O'Clock!**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NC00WLn.gif)\n\n## The most personal Nouns product yet\n\nExplore a diverse range of personalization options with the interchangeable straps.

With 128 unique combinations, the NounsWatch will fits various styles.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9ptDzga.png)\n\n## First Prototypes\n\nTo demonstrate our unwavering commitment to the project, not only have we developed two 3D-printed prototypes, as shown below, but we've also field-tested the product for comfort and fit on the wrists. Just imagine how stunning these will look when adorned with the final production finish and colorful straps! Watch the prototype live in video: [here](https://x.com/rsmiranda/status/1714557390241059120?s=20) and [here.](https://x.com/fabioseva/status/1714901327631843711?s=46&t=OnA_W289RIsplarDuhpSrg)\nNote: The current brand identity will be revised for production version.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PekUrdI.png)\n\n## Final Product Specs\n\n**Case:** Injected Polycarbonate, 42 mm x 42 mm x 6 mm.\n**Movement:** Japanese.\n**Dial**: Exquisite half display reading system, black dial with contrasting numbers.\n**Glass:** Mineral glass with anti-reflective coating.¬†\n**Strap:** Soft Silicone.\n**Water resistance:** Yes (3ATM)\n\n---\n\n# Dwiss: a decade of innovation\n\nDWISS - the manufacturer - is a¬†niche watch brand founded in 2011 by Rafael Miranda, a former professor of watch design in Milan, Italy. His accolades include several design awards and publications in the watch industry.\n\nThe brand is committed to craft distinctive timepieces that¬†stands out with innovative designs and¬†groundbreaking features, including the use of pioneering materials and early adoption of¬†web3 technology such as cryptocurrency, NFTs and metaverse experiences in the watch space.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p8gK5Fi.png)\n\n![](https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1694722112/t9ce7v5l3t52g3azgydp.png)\n\n![](https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1694722042/xhyf0mdtyqkfiip0plmr.jpg)\n\n\n## Contemporary distribution methods\n\nDWISS also excels in modern distribution methods. Leveraging the power of crowdfunding and Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) strategies, launching multiple campaigns and mastering influencer and digital advertising. These accomplishments attest to DWISS's strong marketing and sales capabilities, setting a **solid foundation for the success of our Go-to-Market strategy for NounsWatch**.\n\nCrowdfunding campaigns that generated more than USD $1.5 million.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/U5gHT6Y.png)\n\nDwiss have a portfolio of influencers that have millions of followers especially in Youtube, but also instagram, facebook, blogs and magazines.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JS08Qcu.png)\n\nDwiss masters Digital Advertising, generating 9.4 millions of impressions, and 109k clicks in 2023 alone.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f3G84AV.png)\n\n---\n\n# A unparalleled opportunity to reach a new audience\n\nWe meticulously planned a winning Go-to-Market Strategy to make the most of it with optimal resources. **The NounsWatch collection seizes an unparalleled opportunity of introducing Nouns to a whole new audience.** \n\n## Step 0: Entering the Affordable Fashion Market\n\nIn an industry that generated over $70 billion in 2022, fashion ranks as the second most significant reason people wear watches, trailing only behind timekeeping. This largely accounts for why the fashion watch segment records the highest annual unit sales in the tens of millions. **The NounsWatch collection pricing and style aims to secure a position in the largest portion of this growing segment: the sub-$200 fashion watch market.**\n\nThat said, time to sell.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DprKVhF.png)\n\n## Step 1: A pre-sale shortcut to meet 10 Million customers on Indiegogo\n\nA common challenge to IRL products is meeting the minimum order quantities (MOQ) whilst ensuring enough demand for the product. And for custom designed watches, the MOQ of 1000 pieces makes the equation a bit challenging. \n\nThanks to Dwiss successful track record on Indiegogo campaigns we can have a reputable access to create a Drop.\n\nAn Indiegogo Drop is an exclusive offer for qualified business that serves a discount pre-sale channel without the need for the regular crowdfunding. The highlight is the added layer of marketing to reach the fullest of Indiegogo‚Äôs 10 million monthly visitors and 1 million combined social media followers from 235 countries.\n\nDwiss will launch a NounsWatch Drop pre-sale for the price of ~~$189.00~~ $129.00 with [teaser videos and images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7ZsbPHqzFw) that will feature Nouns on the homepage of the Indiegogo website, as well as in related content such as carousels, newsletters, and social media.\n\n**By doing so, we aim to generate sufficient demand for NounsWatch, particularly from outside the Nouns and watchmaking communities, thus bringing it closer to mainstream media and markets.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/exRMxAh.png)\n\n## Step 2: Continuous sale on the NounsWatch Shopify store\n\nAfter the presale window concludes, sales will resume in our website [nounswatch.com](http://nounswatch.com/) for $189.00 ($169.00 for selected communities), where we will accept both fiat currency and cryptocurrency. Leveraging the same proven digital marketing strategy that Dwiss employs for its products, we are going to use a share of the sales profit in Digital Advertising to generate millions of impressions and drive hundreds of thousands of clicks to our website, until the point of delivery and after. If demand falls short, Dwiss name is in play. We bear the risk and will undertake the responsibility of selling the product.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jIsZVSV.jpg)\n\n## Step 3: Ding-dong! Delivery Time\n\nUpon receiving the initial shipment from the factory, we'll start fulfilling orders through both Indiegogo and Shopify channels. At the same time, we'll ramp up our marketing efforts to stimulate new demand, focusing on a broad [influencer campaign and a user-generated content initiative](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5h5gh3ZqPzjm_Rrt6FKdrTbbJ00IF9Es). **This is a pivotal moment for the NounsWatch and Nouns history, and we are committed to maximizing its impact.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wztkALV.png)\n\n## Step 4: The NounsWatch Legacy\n\n**Spin the Flywheel (new!)**\nRegardless the supply, **10% of every NounsWatch collection sales revenue will be sent back to the Treasury** and submitted to Propdates. Assuming a pre-sale sold-out of 1000 pieces, the gross revenue would be $129,000. 10% of this ($12,900) goes back to the DAO treasury, further reducing the actual costs to the DAO. Sales out of the pre-sale window generate more revenue.\n\n**Release the IP (new!)**\nThe NounsWatch blueprint and 3d files **will be cc0, fully available on the public domain**.\n\n**Everyday, forever (new!)**\nThe objective for NounsWatch is not to exist as a limited edition, but rather to establish it as a standard product in the Dwiss partnership lineup. **We will sustain production for as long as consumer demand remains**, and may release new straps, models, and features when deemed appropriate.\n\n**Warranty and Customer Support**\nDwiss will provide a world-class ongoing support and warranty for customers after 2 years they have purchased NounsWatch.\n\n---\n\n## **Funds Allocation**\n\nWe have meticulously planned the budget to ensure optimal allocation of funds across all critical aspects of the project. Our financial strategy for V2 has been redesigned to sustain our competitive pricing strategy while accommodating the increased workload of the team until the sales take-off. \n\nWe have estimated the financial requirements for the NounsWatch project as follows:\n\n- $5,000 - Development\n- $90,000 - NounsWatch and straps (1,000 pieces)\n- $10,000 - Packaging\n- $25,000 - External Labor and Taxes\n- $14,000 - First-Class Video and 3D Production (third-party services)\n- $7,000 - Indiegogo Drop Paid Feature Package\n- $18,000 - Team Compensation\n\n**TOTAL ASK: $169,000 USDC**\nWallet: [dwiss.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x80b0b325D6A1E19953dFffb6Cc117263916796F8)\n\n## Timeline\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UK7lhJP.png)\n\n---\n\n## Team\n\n[Fabio Seva](https://x.com/fabioseva) - Concept & Marketing\nLilNoun#125, nouns-pilled founder of [Public Good Beer](https://twitter.com/publicgoodbeer?s=21&t=OnA_W289RIsplarDuhpSrg)\n[Rafael Miranda](https://x.com/rsmiranda) - Design\nLilNoun#7753, watch designer and Dwiss founder\n[Dwiss](https://x.com/dwisswatch) - Production and operations\n\n---\n\n**Acknowledgments:** we would like to thank the dozens of comments we received during V1, which enabled us to develop this new version.

Looking forward to your thoughts!\n\n---\n\n*‚ÄúIs Nouns activity growing?‚Äù ‚ÄúWho is helping increase engagement and spreading the meme?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhich proposals are driving growth?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs our spend rate?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow many builders are contributing to the Nouns ecosystem?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre the amount of proposal candidates increasing?‚Äù*\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\nWe aim to create a single-purpose website where Nouns activity metrics are published. It will integrate activity across social channels and highlight which Nouns, advocates, and proposals have best supported the Noun‚Äôs meme propagation. Our creative motto is: *Track Memes, Not People.*\n\nAs a starting point, this proposal focuses on [1] onchain activity (supported by the Nouns subgraph), [2] two sources of social media (Farcaster and Instagram), and [3] a limited set of metrics ‚Äî such as proposal submissions, votes, comments, posts, and engagement. Opportunistically, we will incorporate additional sources and expand the set of metrics.\n\n## Background\n\nAs of the moment, the Nouns‚Äô community and audience members produce a wide variety of data. Over time, more data is likely to migrate onchain (e.g. similar to vote comments today) and data will be produced across even more digital localities. The *United World of Nouns* will have a wide-ranging data footprint. Combining data across these localities can become a powerful tool for proposal development and decision-making.\n\nHowever, as @Krel mentioned in their [Request for Proposers](https://www.notion.so/Nouns-DAO-Request-for-Proposers-94dadff999ac493b9902aa002e4b296e?pvs=21):\n\n> *‚ÄúNouns DAO does not have a reliable way to measure ‚Äògrowth‚Äô or ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô. Its not clear what should be measured, or what growth in the context of Nouns even means.‚Äù*\n> \n\nThis project will create an initial repository of activity growth combining onchain and offchain data. We are long overdue to experiment on this front!\n\n## Scope\n\nThe metrics tracker will be in the form of a single-purpose web application.\n\nTo begin, we will include onchain data available in the Nouns Subgraph and two social media channels: Farcaster and Instagram. We will publish a selection of core metrics that provide clarity to Noun holders and the wider community.\n\nMost importantly, the underlying data pool (Meme Activity Database) will serve a first step towards a data-driven Nouns culture, which community members and potential builders can use to find opportunities for proposal submissions.\n\nSuccess of this project will be measured based on web application usage (unique visitors), proposal references (e.g. This project will increase X metric supporting Noun activity growth), and data pool connections (e.g. external usage of the Meme Activity Database).\n\nAs a stretch goal, we will look to expand the data sources, for example including key derivative NFT projects (Gnars, LilNouns, cc0-lib) and other dominant social spaces (Discord, Discourse, X, Lens, etc).\n\n*Note: X (formerly Twitter) has been deprioritized due to its cost ($5k per month) until initiative is proven useful. It would be included in future proposals.*\n\n*Note: Discord has been deprioritized due to its fragmentation (there multiple Nouns servers) until initiative is proven useful. It would be included in future proposals.*\n\n## Product Components\n\n### \n\nWhenever we want to test our internet speed, we can easily go to a speed test website. If we want to see how our activity on X (formerly Twitter), we can go to profile analytics. \n\n**Where do we go to check how the Nouns ecosystem is growing?** We go to *.*\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByD5JEHfp.png)\n\nThe Pulse is a single purpose website showcasing onchain and offchain activity metrics. This includes public conversations related to the **********************United World of Nouns.********************** The main graph, which we are currently calling *‚ÄúActivity Momentum‚Äù* will showcase daily activity growth, a proxy for the Noun meme adoption and mind-share online.\n\nOur data analytics approach will combine methodologies from (1) traditional media broadcasting (e.g. combining data like number of views, replies, likes, proposal submissions, unique voters, etc.), (2) crypto-native metrics common across DAOs, and (3) materials science and engineering (read more about how engineers develop [material selection indexes here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_selection)).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJSJgVrGp.png)\n\nData will be synchronized in real-time directly from the Nouns‚Äô Subgraph, Farcaster, Instagram to an SQL database. The sync mechanism will be architected in a uniform adapter interface for easier future integration with other onchain data and offchain sources, such as Twitter, Discourse, Discord, Telegram, DeSo, and Lens.\n\n**Example Onchain Metrics:**\n\n- Treasury\n- Treasury Usage Rate (Monthly Spend)\n- Burn Value\n- Candidate Props Growth\n- Proposal Submissions Growth\n- Active Proposals\n- Percent of Proposals Funded\n- Total Unique Builders\n- Average Auction Price\n\n**Example Offchain Metrics:**\n\n- Number of Posts\n- Total Engagement (Likes+Comments+Shares)\n- Engagement Rate (Ratio of Engagement to Posts)\n- Most Engaged Content\n- Total Followers\n- Follower Growth Rate (Updated based on API opportunity)\n- Noggles Score: Count of posts using ‚Äú‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®‚Äù on Farcaster*\n\n**In the first phase it won‚Äôt be possible to index Instagram posts by content, only be hashtags. As a result, the Noggles Score won‚Äôt be able to include Instagram posts.*\n\n### Meme Activity Database (a.k.a. The MAD)\n\nCurcially, the product‚Äôs underlying data model will be available for others to query and contribute to. That way, others can embed the index into their own Noun interfaces. Anyone should be able to get clean and reliable **meme-data-as-a-service** to support a diversity of Noun initiatives. Imagine a world where active proposals have conversation hype trackers, or ongoing projects can easily see total impressions across social media channels.\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to facilitate the use of data across the Nouns ecosystem. As the cc0 library enables media usage, the activity database enables tracking and impact analysis.\n\nThe Web API interface will be available publicly in the form of parametrizable JSON endpoints. The data will be distributed per specific sources (onchain Nouns, Farcaster, and others) as well as in aggregated form to enable the development of tools such as alerts, bots, and analytics dashboards.\n\n## Product Roadmap\n\nThe execution of this project will be done in an iterative fashion. By building in public and getting ongoing feedback, we can deliver what the community needs, and data that will support Nouns decisions.\n\n**Iterative Phases:**\n\n- **Phase 1:** Deliver basic UI w/ limited branding and processed Farcaster data displayed in form of metrics. Deliver mock-up UI for onchain metrics and Instagram metrics. Host open Q&A with Nouns (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 2:** Deliver basic UI w/ Farcaster metric feedback, plus Noun Subgraph indexing and onchain metrics. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 3:** Deliver basic UI w/ Farcaster, Onchain metric feedback, and Instagram metrics for specific accounts and hashtags. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 4:** Complete UI polishing and metrics calibration. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to celebrate launch and discuss future opportunities (where next).\n\n## An Ambitious Vision\n\nThis project aims to uncover what ‚ÄúNouns-Native‚Äù analytics could look like, and what data infrastructure is necessary to feed this analytics into the broader Nouns governance and participation process.\n\nWe‚Äôve already intuited that we want to ***Track*** ***Memes, Not People*** ‚Äî and we‚Äôre certain there will be other innovations along the way. After all, we need to address challenges in crossing the web3-to-web2 data pipeline chasm. Is it possible? We think so.\n\nNouns is a place for ambitious ideas, and we are an ambitious team.\n\n## Team\n\nThis project will be led and executed by Rafa Fernandez (Farcaster: @rafa) and Rafi Gutkowski (Farcaster: @rafi). \n\n- Rafa Fernandez is a community architect with a focus on building [Digital Public Utilities](https://www.notion.so/General-Networks-e4615b9b52294f8bab34a82b47023d11?pvs=21). He has decade of experience in corporate analytics and studied materials-science and engineering. He is the founder of Folklore (Folklore.Institute), a community that curates and commissions research on digital cultures. Most recently, he was part of the Summer of Protocols research program looking at [online swarms](https://www.notion.so/Welcome-to-the-Swarm-41c114211ac045f087c44c16bd993748?pvs=21). Previous to the program he worked at Mirror where he worked in creator partnerships and community development.\n- Rafi Gutkowski is a software engineer and data scientist ([libred.org](https://libred.org/), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/rgutkowski)). He started mining bitcoin in 2015 but only after exiting from his recent startup, did he double down on web3. Since then Rafi has been working on sementic analysis of decentralized social graphs, as well as creating web3-web2 bridges, such as Folklore‚Äôs web3-signature to feed [broadcast applet](https://www.notion.so/Folklore-5d34757913064064b87119c4593eda74?pvs=21).\n\n## Funding\n\nWe are a stream of 22.5 ETH to fund this project over approximately 10 weeks.\n\nThe funds will be allocated to a two-person team (Rafa and Rafi). They are split roughly 25-75 between planning and iterative engineering. There is about a 40-40-10 between data engineering, visuals and handoff. There is approximately 10% reserved for bugs and issue resolution.\n\nWe expect that once the initial traunch of data engineering and visuals is complete, then we can make a decision on what the community needs more of (if anything), such as expanded data, or expanded analysis\n\n## Our Commitments\n\n- We commit to posting updates on¬†[updates.wtf](https://updates.wtf/)¬†with sprint plan and outcomes, in alignment with each of the community Q&A feedback sessions.\n- We commit to cancelling the stream based on community feedback.\n- We commit to executing this work as an open-source project, such that other onchain communities and organizations can benefit.\n\n## Other Notes\n\nThis proposal was built based on the Basic Nouns Proposal Template, built by Rafa and available here: https://hackmd.io/@rafathebuilder/BkPAmHZbp\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to learn more about this proposal, the first Q&A conversation on Aburra is available here: https://youtu.be/_dr2yZulMG"},{"blockNumber":18471858,"blockHash":"0x1acff2dda573f53233d67cbfcd34c04ed00ece22bd668aa6ad5ec30195db56bf","transactionIndex":102,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x5784e12b30813a73247bba0074de3aa8c33eb99ee0141927ed45eaa6be197446","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":428,"proposer":"0x2666f0C8FB58d182f2Dd79475DCA4A07B3724607","signers":[],"targets":["0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03"],"signatures":["safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef71000000000000000000000000e3f27deff96fe178e87559f36cbf868b9e75967d00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b5"],"startBlock":18493458,"endBlock":18522258,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18489858,"proposalThreshold":0,"quorumVotes":36,"description":"# Gift Noun 181 to Sasquatch\n\n## The Legend of Esports\n\nSasquatch founded Nouns Esports 1.5 years ago, swiftly establishing it as one of the premier esports organizations globally.

People involved in seemingly different fields, such as social contribution organizations and the web3 community, will gather together with the aim of creating new support and revenue methods that combine social problem solving and web3.\n\n- Simultaneously with the charity event, we will be hosting ‚ÄúNoggles Jack Nagoya‚Äù and the ‚Äúweb3 Community Exhibition,‚Äù expecting over 1,000 attendees. In line with the event, there will be talk sessions, Nouns' booths, workshops, promotional merchandise distributions, and planned social contribution activities.\n\n- Prior to the event, we will have a booth for Nouns at the Design Festa in Tokyo on Sunday, November 12, 2023. Following our previous Proposal 228 ‚ÄúNoggles Jack Tokyo,‚Äù this will be our second event where we will display and sell Nouns merchandise. Moreover, we will also be promoting ‚ÄúBright Any Colors with ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®.‚Äù\n\n## Background & Challenges\n- While individuals possess various facets, society often fails to accept them, because it's easier to manage by measuring everyone against a uniform set of values, leading to a tendency to avoid complexity.\nI believe that the biggest societal issue lies in the attempt to oversimplify intricate matters. Many people in today's society are bound by existing frameworks, having forgotten how to create new concepts and systems on their own accord.\n\n- The utilization of web3 technology for societal transformation is in an trial phase, but leveraging Nouns' autonomous decentralized system has the potential to assist.\nThere's a need for support towards technology that encourages ‚Äúpluralistic‚Äù decision-making and collaboration, as well as the activities that accompany it.\n\n- In October 2022, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities pointed out that Japan's education for persons with disabilities is lagging behind and made [recommendations.](https://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=6QkG1d%2FPPRiCAqhKb7yhsox6sZe%2Fik6d3iDJzISRPhvIaActFR9I%2FAIZ%2Be8dEYc3x9pGI%2BAqnUjiYnhf%2BzLRJLqW2mBzZdcaW0%2B10tvwrA97qOnmCuV89Qwl7dhkmc1B) However, there has been still no progress in understanding and awareness of disabilities, and the separation of special needs education from regular classes has been seen as a problem.\nFurthermore, research and studies on rare and congenital diseases are struggling due to the influence of market principles and an emphasis on efficiency.\n\n- ‚ÄúBright Any Colors‚Äù is aimed at supporting individuals with disabilities, children, and students. Participants will be able to exchange opinions within the event, increasing the potential for new ideas and solutions to emerge.\n\n## Theme & Objectives\n‚ÄúBright Any Colors with ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®‚Äù aims to enjoyably learn about DAOs through Nouns, aspiring to pave the way for a future where everyone shines their brightest. Our passion for enhancing the lives of all resonates with the public, and we've designed this event hoping that the concepts and systems of web3 naturally gain broader recognition. Relying on the insights and experiences from this endeavor, we will continuously engage in activities that leverage web3 technology to address societal challenges.

This is a fun initiative would accomplish a few things:\n- Further cement Nouns into BasePaint works (noggles have shown up in a few works already: [BP1](https://opensea.io/assets/base/0xba5e05cb26b78eda3a2f8e3b3814726305dcac83/1), [BP33](https://opensea.io/assets/base/0xba5e05cb26b78eda3a2f8e3b3814726305dcac83/33), [BP47](https://opensea.io/assets/base/0xba5e05cb26b78eda3a2f8e3b3814726305dcac83/47) and [BP71](https://opensea.io/assets/base/0xba5e05cb26b78eda3a2f8e3b3814726305dcac83/71)).\n- Ten Nouns artists will be whitelisted for bronze BasePaint brushes to collaborate with the BasePaint community. If you're interested, [apply]([link](https://tally.so/r/3NlAMB)) and mention Nouns.\n- Support BasePaint crypto native artists \n- Make our first transaction on an L2!\n\nI've been in contact with the cofounders of BasePaint ([Zach](zherring) and [WINTŒûR](https://twitter.com/w1nt3r_eth)) to set the themes for the days on which Nouns would be minting. \n\n## Logistics:\n- We‚Äôd be using the [BasePaint bot](https://www.basepaintbot.com/) to commit the ETH. \n- The proposal would be calling [Base Portal contract on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x49048044D57e1C92A77f79988d21Fa8fAF74E97e#readProxyContract) which would both deposit and call the [BasePaint bot contract](https://basescan.org/address/0xb129419F9B035E9d80B4a320ffcf5BE93Cb7994B#code). \n- We'd be minting 699 each day (at a cost of 0.00286 per mint) for a total of 1.9999 ETH per day (699 * 0.00286).\n- The mints would be under the [DAO's alias address](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/deposits.md#address-aliasing) so that the DAO can call it from L1 if it chooses to move them.\n\n\n## Timeline:\n\n- Assuming the proposal passes, the mint would start 9 days after the proposal is put onchain (7 days vote turnaround + 2 days queued). \n\n## Where the ETH would go:\nThere‚Äôs a 10% fee that the BasePaint bot takes at mint. Once minted, 90% of the profits of the OE are distributed to the artists proportional to the number of pixels they painted. 10% goes to the protocol.\n\n--- \n\n*A big thank you to [solimander](https://x.com/_solimander_), [backseats](https://x.com/backseats_eth) and [wilson](https://x.com/wilsoncusack) who helped put the tx together*"},{"blockNumber":18521260,"blockHash":"0x21daffceae535d17783b5c88a12884da47c93cc648b9b11e28d737e2d64b83d5","transactionIndex":81,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x31b0f78350b647d178b0fc361904cc1fb237e2efcfb4e51bbd5ea54ba818b032","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":432,"proposer":"0x8e6aB6D4F70cc6E00a61498A427DF5e9407dDf0e","signers":["0x3B60e31CFC48a9074CD5bEbb26C9EAa77650a43F"],"targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000008e6ab6d4f70cc6e00a61498a427df5e9407ddf0e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ba43b7400"],"startBlock":18542860,"endBlock":18571660,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18539260,"proposalThreshold":0,"quorumVotes":37,"description":"# One Noun 3D Animation, Every Day ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® (Revised)  \n\n# \n\n\n**This is a  revised version of [Candidate: 2 YEARS OF EVERYDAY 3D ANIMATIONS ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®](https://www.nouns.camp/candidates/0x8e6ab6d4f70cc6e00a61498a427df5e9407ddf0e-2-years-of-everyday-3d-animations---), which incorporates all the given feedback via Twitter, Discord and Candidate comments.**\n\n\n## **TL;DR**\nNounsLATAM is seeking $50K to develop, produce and distribute daily 3D animated Noun-themed videos on a global scope for six months. \nOur initial aim was to develop, produce and distribute over 800 engaging 3D animated Noun-themed videos on a global scale for 2 years of everyday animations.

If you have already read our Propdate (thank you), skip ahead to the Section \"Our Guiding Goals for Season 3.\" Otherwise, please read on! ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®*\n\n# **Proposal Summary:**\n\n**The Noun Square Onchain Media Collective is one of the most committed, effective and [Lindy](https://postimg.cc/tYtDP1vt) teams ever funded by Nouns.**\n\nWe have been making an impact on our community daily throughout Season 2 via Spaces, art contests, community support, video content and more, with a highly engaged network of fans that has produced nearly **6 Million unique content impressions** so far this year on X alone. \n\nWe've responded to Nouner feedback and leaned down our operations this year as much as possible, shifting focus to the creation of more rich video content, including a promising new weekly video podcast called **[Zero Rights Reserved](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTVC2ZZHVXuArObREO5PTfJr5S4uHTArB&si=oKkJ2sO4v5IN-iXQ)**, which has racked up over **350,000 views** across our socials in just 4 months. \n\nWe've also been trailblazers when it comes to Nouns on Ethereum L2's, onboarding our community to **Optimism, Zora** Network and soon **BASE** through various initiatives and educational content. \n\nUnique among funded Nouns projects, we have raised more than 20 ETH in operations funding from non-Nouns sources so far this year, and have stretched our previous 6 month mandate to 9+ months. \n\nToday, we are requesting 130 ETH (~6 Noun auctions at current FMV) to support the growth of our various initiatives for 6 more months.  \n\nEducational media and onboarding resources are an **integral Public Good** for the Ethereum ecosystem, and when a Nouns-funded initiative like TNS brings consistent value to our own sphere, while also spreading that love to other onchain communities... **we think that's Nounish to the core.**\n\n\n# Last Season, On The Noun Square...\n\n**A Short List of Notable Things We Accomplished During Season 2:** \n\n- We have remained steadfast in our commitment to act as a reliable daily touchpoint for the nouniverse, **hosting more than 500 Noun O' Clock LIVE shows in a row without missing a single day**, accumulating almost **40,000 total Spaces listens** year-to-date and impressive overall engagement metrics from our X Community, including an average of **20,000** impressions, **215** Likes and **112** Re-Posts **PER DAY.**\n- After receiving Nouner feedback, we pivoted much of our team energy into creating more pieces of engaging video content like **[\"This Week in Nouns\"](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTVC2ZZHVXuBZaPBVC__DW_HdEQim5a6w&si=be3WF3y0mAi4UYMV)**, **[Educational Tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTVC2ZZHVXuBM692fS5fW15VZ0tGBjts1&si=fij7H6coaiHs__JE)**, and our new weekly video podcast **[Zero Rights Reserved](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTVC2ZZHVXuArObREO5PTfJr5S4uHTArB&si=2iXB-u-jIpMeerjz)**.\n- We scaled back our original project scope considerably by sunsetting/\"open-sourcing\" the SoapBox program (more on this below), and leaned down the core team to do more with less, ultimately stretching a 6 month engagement to 9+ months.\n- We have raised a total of 20+ ETH so far towards the funding of our operations and contests via a combination of trial sponsorship collaborations with values-aligned groups, non-nouns grants awards, and our daily NOMO Edition mint proceeds. \n- We have positioned ourselves as a vanguard of nounish activity on Ethereum L2, educating and onboarding our community to the Optimism network via NOMO, the Zora Network through our weekly podcast open editions, and soon the BASE L2 with our imminent Yellow Collective launch. \n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n# 1) Consistency and Community-Building \n\nSo far this year, we have hosted **311** consecutive Noun O' Clock LIVE X Spaces, bringing our lifetime running total to **510 straight Spaces**. If you include our various other nounish Spaces as well, the total year-to-date jumps to 857 Spaces, which equates to 921 total hours on air, or a total of **38 full days of broadcasting nounish content**, with a total of **37,800** cumulative listeners. \n\n[![spaces-stats-red-bg.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/d1xdLB4R/spaces-stats-red-bg.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/wyD3rhK3)\n*YTD stats from Superspaces.ai*\n\nOn top of our daily Spaces participation, we have seen tremendous X/Twitter timeline engagement from the TNS community on our art contests, video content and other daily posts, with an impressive **5.9 Million impressions** so far year to date, which equates to nearly 20,000 impressions, 215 Likes and 112 Re-Posts per DAY. We've also completely organically grown our following by almost 100% to **9100 followers**, which makes us the largest nounish account by follower count on X after @nounsdao and our friends at @nounsesports.   \n\n[![spaces-stats-copy-fixed-full-year.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/SKbTM93h/spaces-stats-copy-fixed-full-year.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/FYGVtYhW)\n*YTD stats from X.com*\n\n\n\n---\n\nIn addition to serving as a consistent and reliable content hub for Nouns fans, we have also strived to be **a helpful media liaison to nounish subDAOs and funded Nouns projects**, helping to coordinate and host Twitter/X events, Discord events and more, and generally amplify their messaging to our network.\n\n**Some examples of this kind of community support:**\n- Supporting the \"Nouns: A Movie\" team by coordinating and hosting a watch party for their Rise of Blus Episode 1 Premiere, and amplifying their various announcements and initiatives like open casting calls, etc.\n- Supporting the Nouns AI pod by cohosting a weekly Update Call in our Discord that was free for anyone to join and keep up to date on what that team was building, as well as general news from the AI space. **([Example archive recording.](https://youtu.be/iKzf5ALz01A?si=Ajb4lsPNkOIGJANz))** We also produced this **[awesome video](https://x.com/TheHeroShep/status/1714689055248838840?s=20)** summarizing everything Nouns AI accomplished in 2023. \n- Supporting Nouns Esports by amplifying various contests and announcements, co-hosting weekly Twitter/X Spaces, and hosting a live **[watch party](https://x.com/nounsesports/status/1717691609356132612?s=20)** by request during their TI12 faceoff against Gaiman Gladiators.\n- Collaborating with Nouns Agora to host a **[Nouns Governance Discussion](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40thenounsquare%20%40nounsagora&src=typed_query&f=live)** most weeks on X Spaces with Yitong.\n- Supporting Brennen's **[Tavern project](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1717724845188796846?s=20)** by recently moving one day per week of Noun O' Clock LIVE to tavern.fm. (Not a Nouns-funded project per se, but Brennen is a Nouner and we like the duck.)  \n- Collaborating with Lil Nouns DAO's The Lil Nouns Show, and producing a feature video on their funded Lil Bevs proposal (tentative release date late November.)\n- Collaborating with subDAOs such as Lil Nouns DAO, Gnars, Food Nouns, Nouns Amigos, Nouns Japan, NounsCN, Nouns BR and more to host and cohost regular spaces for their communities.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Discovering and Empowering Nounish Artists:**\n\nOur art contests have continued to be very popular in terms of engagement, and also continue to impress in terms of quality and quantity of output. Here are a couple examples of winning entries from some of our many art contests this year:\n\n**Nounish Halloween Contest**\n\n[![halloween-contest-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/wBDnZ878/halloween-contest-gif.gif)](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1719770338379141525?s=20)\n\n**TNS Anniversary Art Contest Winners**\n\n[![anniversary-contest-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/28nVS3qP/anniversary-contest-gif.gif)](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1668684529484148736?s=20)\n\n\n\nWe constantly see new people tuning into our Spaces and engaging with our content, asking questions about Nouns, etc. in the days following an art contest. This is part of the reason why we have centered the vision of our upcoming Yellow Collective launch around funding and empowering as many nounish artists and creatives as possible (more below.)\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Crowd-Sourced \"FOMO\" Auction Settling:**\n\nSpeaking of art, another way that TNS has contributed to the Nouns ecosystem is by making a fun daily spectacle of choosing the new Noun of the Day on Noun O' Clock LIVE. \n\nWith the help of our audience, we have settled some pretty amazing Nouns this year, including some special ones for occasions, such as a Halloween Ghost, a Birthday Cake for Aug 8, a Black Cat for Token 666, etc. Some of these aesthetic Nouns have sold at auction for above-average prices, even despite the fork dynamic. Noun 658 (Dark Factory) for example **sold for 51 ETH, a full 25 ETH more than the average Noun was going for at that time.**\n\nWe also challenged ourselves earlier this year to try and mint every unminted Noun head, and succeeded just prior to the 2nd Nouniversary. We then challenged ourselves again to mint all the newly added heads as quickly as possible, and succeeded in less than 2 weeks. As a result, **[Proposal 401](https://nouns.wtf/noun/904)** was able to award every contributing artist an existing Noun with their own created head. \n\nHere is a small selection of the many very aesthetic Nouns we helped to mint so far this year: \n\n[![aesthetic-nouns.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/vB6qcD16/aesthetic-nouns.gif)](https://postimg.cc/0MPd4k08)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n# 2) A Fresh Focus on Video Content:\n\nDuring the earliest months of this season, TNS was producing and facilitating an average of 40 Twitter/X Spaces per week for various nounish communities. We sought and received feedback from nouners and our audience, and learned that their favorite content was our educational/informative video content on YouTube and TikTok, and so we decided as a team to shift our resources and attention towards **increasing the production of this kind of rich media content on a more regular basis.**\n\nSince that time, we have been producing an average of 5-8 high quality pieces of video content per month. Here are some notable examples of content produced by TNS this year: \n\n\n\n---\n\n**This Week in Nouns** Series (FKA Prop Talk): A 3 minute weekly video summarizing everything exciting that's happening in Nouns. Primarily an **[X-native release](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40thenounsquare%20%22this%20week%20in%20nouns%22&src=typeahead_click)**, these have received a combined **70,000+ views** so far this year.\n\n[![twin-gif-for-prop.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/D0Mn1F5S/twin-gif-for-prop.gif)](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1709595587232890942?s=20)\n*(Click GIF to Watch Video)*\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Crypto Advocacy / Gitcoin:** Nouns doesn't celebrate its wins often enough, so we decided to make a **[short video about our 100K donation to the Gitcoin Crypto Advocacy Round.](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1678837682565152770?s=20)** This piece of evergreen content has received nearly **30,000 views so far.** \n\n[![gitcoin-gif-for-prop.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/T2qk1ChX/gitcoin-gif-for-prop.gif)](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1678837682565152770?s=20)\n*(Click GIF to Watch Video)*\n\n---\n\n**Nouns AI pod** asked us to produce an engaging video about everything they had built in 2023. This was primarily an X release, but you can also watch it **[here on YouTube.](https://youtu.be/dvRuodQLXoc?si=Sv1NobSjXa8aK5Mu)**\n\n[![nounsai-gif-for-prop.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/j2mCtyp3/nounsai-gif-for-prop.gif)](https://youtu.be/dvRuodQLXoc?si=Sv1NobSjXa8aK5Mu)\n*(Click GIF to Watch Video)*\n\n---\n\n**Tutorials and Educational Videos About Onchain Life:** Our community loves learning about Ethereum, how to use L2s, how to apply for grants, etc. and our TNS Tutorials Series helps them along that path. Our **[Tutorials videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTVC2ZZHVXuBM692fS5fW15VZ0tGBjts1&si=vsbbrErNy6ILUUuh)** have accumulated over **50,000 views** this year across our socials. \n\n[![Screen-Shot-2023-11-06-at-4-26-47-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/NfxfNqMP/Screen-Shot-2023-11-06-at-4-26-47-PM.png)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTVC2ZZHVXuBM692fS5fW15VZ0tGBjts1&si=vsbbrErNy6ILUUuh)\n*(Click Image to Visit Playlist)*\n\n\n---\n\n**Notable Video Archives of Popular Twitter Spaces** Events such as our **[All About that Base event](https://youtu.be/U1B50NrIqVM?si=X7vDN5QEnIryZ2oC)** featuring Jesse Pollak, this Nouns **[RageQuit Debate](https://youtu.be/cRG2Zb3Cz4Q)** moderated by the Verbs team, this **[open discussion of Private Voting](https://youtu.be/K_EC54dSf80)**, this CC0 Round-table with **[Danny Cole and David Horvath](https://youtu.be/MSf-Aevh5Dk)**, etc.\n\n\n\n---\n\nThe **Zero Rights Reserved Podcast:** We are 16 episodes in so far and growing in popularity, with over **350,000 views** so far in 4 just months. (More on this initiative in the dedicated section below.)\n\n[![zeropod-website-header-thing-copy.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/PxhqMF5z/zeropod-website-header-thing-copy.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/hJygDsxf)\n\n\n---\n\n\nIn addition to our long-form content, we have also continued to leverage our TNS **[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquare?_t=8h8pOJQlvBn&_r=1)** **[Accounts](https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquarebr?_t=8h8pKkn4Zmi&_r=1)** to repurpose shorter versions of our videos, and platform-native shorts. We've continued to grow our English language and Brazilian Portuguese language accounts this year to a combined 38,500 followers, and have received over **150,000 views** on our short videos there YTD.  \n\n**Year-to-date, our video content has received over 650,000 views across our socials,** with 70% of that content coming in the latter part of the Season following our renewed emphasis on video production. We hope to continue this momentum into Season 3 and **surpass 1 million+ video views over the next 6 months.**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n# 3) The Zero Rights Reserved Podcast: Early Signs of Success\n\n[![zero-rights-reserved-intro-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/bJRYx7HT/zero-rights-reserved-intro-gif.gif)](https://postimg.cc/sQvRy0LQ)\n\n[**Zero Rights Reserved**](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/toady-hawk) is a weekly video podcast that we launched in June as part of our renewed focus on creating more rich digital media. It is a podcast about Nouns, DAOs, Ethereum, Art and more, and our goal is to interview interesting guests from around the onchain space from a Nounish perspective, while entertaining and educating our audience and bridging gaps to other like-minded communities. \n\nSo far, the podcast has been getting very good feedback from listeners both inside and outside the nouns community, as well as from the guests that we have hosted so far:\n\n[![zeropod-feedback.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fW785HM2/zeropod-feedback.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/V569kWrn)\n\n**Here is the list of our incredible guests so far:**\n- **[Jack Butcher](https://youtu.be/V4raMn3pCjQ?si=WcWJ-6vuUY9W3T26)** (Checks, Opepen, Visualize Value)\n- **[Bob Burnquist](https://youtu.be/2E13m-nsD9U?si=0c5uJ9vO3_q3y_6a)** (Skateboarding Legend)\n- **[Dan Romero](https://youtu.be/l4K9B53F8w0?si=JCVlUbBl5oi8JDI1)** (Farcaster Founder)\n- **[Luca Netz](https://youtu.be/HUZe7z_EORs?si=-pwrmaolOemr1e-Y)** (CEO Pudgy Penguins)\n- **[Chris Waters and Eric Towner](https://youtu.be/05B5BsWHF44?si=r6kLBMXPMU7eLmF7)** (Stoopid Buddy)\n- **[Supriyo](https://youtu.be/4RRQ_GqOzq8?si=-d9W9HqPs3zJE-Eg)** (Atrium, Nouns: A Movie)\n- **[Nate Angell](https://youtu.be/leNyYe4k6MA?si=B8hRbrK2eB3k5Rpz)** (Creative Commons)\n- **[Azeem Khan and Ben West](https://youtu.be/fAPxyHl_Yhk?si=TDOR3I66ntRPvAxt)** (Gitcoin)\n- **[Chris Carella](https://youtu.be/3JjblckvKZI?si=Zz7JZ4ppERV8-wQE)** (Purple, Energy)\n- **[Psych](https://youtu.be/1f6sUZlL1wE?si=ZUen2zhbXLWFeOl6)** (Cofounder Deadfellaz)\n- **[Snax](https://youtu.be/4xIL4vooNfM?si=sm57AU-X03NPQyad)** (Founder, Pizza DAO)\n- **[CryptoPunk Noah](https://youtu.be/lka91nApcc0?si=HAd6GsbRJ9oeMPAo)** (Artist, Prev Christie's, Yuga)\n- **[Amanda Terry](https://youtu.be/cD7J6QdrK28?si=cdOTMEiIsJ-XECw5)** (Cofounder, OnChainMonkey)\n- **[Aubtoshi](https://youtu.be/rrthX1cUxJY?si=WwVkI1h7PE3vbAwk)** (Nouns OTG)\n- **[Ed Balloon](https://youtu.be/1f6sUZlL1wE?si=Wbtabhx64GkXqUYI)** (Artist, Musician)\n- **[Binji Pande](https://youtu.be/V4raMn3pCjQ?si=fro8Y-Fbf1_oeS_B)** (Optimism Collective, OPLabs)\n\n*Upcoming guests (already recorded): Vinnie Hager, Grace and Brian Guan (founders of Unlonely.)*\n\n\n[![optimized-zzr-16-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/RFWGKmBr/optimized-zzr-16-gif.gif)](https://postimg.cc/njtvf6rT)\n\n\n\n**ZEROPOD** has also proven to be our most popular piece of recurring video content so far, racking up over **350K impressions across TNS socials for the first 16 episodes.** Podcast subscriptions and downloads are all steadily growing, and from a human-impact perspective, the initiative has been a great bridge to other values-aligned communities such as **Gitcoin, Checks/Opepen, Deadfellaz, OnChainMonkey, Optimism and more.** We have started to see more and more people from these other communities joining Noun O' Clock LIVE regularly to learn more about Nouns after having their interest piqued by the pod! \n\nOur goal for this next season is to continue to grow the podcast, **exceeding 1 million views across our socials for all episode content**, while continuing to attract similar high-caliber guests, and spending more resources on repurposing this abundance of nounish content into shorter vertical videos for use on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube shorts. \n\nWe have also been minting each episode of ZEROPOD as a special ONCHAIN collection on Zora using the Zora L2 network. **[You can check them out and mint them all for free here.](https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x20035fea4dd659553233fe5ea3ca207e6427b5eb)**\n\nLike all of our content at TNS, and as the name would imply, Zero Rights Reserved is fully CC0, and we have started to compile a simple repository of both raw and edited footage that anyone is free to use however they see fit. **You can view and use the repository[ here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bu09bV8M0DwiPQyWhU9lTE7cI2vJT34r?usp=sharing)**\n\n**We believe ZEROPOD has the potential to become our co-flaship production alongside Noun O' Clock LIVE. The former bringing in nouns-curious eyeballs from all over the web 3 space, while the latter acts as an effective sieve to catch artists and creatives and help them find ways to contribute meaningfully to the community.**\n\n\n\n---\n\n# 4) A Note About Team Adaptability\n\nAs mentioned previously, in the early part of this year, TNS was managing and facilitating up to 40 Twitter Spaces per week for communities such as Gnars, Lil Nouns, Unouns, Nouns Amigos, and more via our **SoapBox Program**. \n\nWhile we do maintain that the SoapBox program was impactful, and was certainly appreciated in many corners of the nouniverse, it also demanded a **lot** of labor to maintain in terms of scheduling, administration, social media messaging, hosting and coordination. As we started to receive feedback from Nouns DAO members that they did not feel SoapBox should be a primary focus for TNS, we made the difficult decision to mostly wind it down.\n\nSo as not to leave our communities in the lurch, we did the social media equivalent of making SoapBox \"open source\": We created a new X account called **TNS OpenMic**, where any nounsfolk can apply to host a show about any nounish community or topic of their choosing. We will still amplify where possible, but without the previous commitment of in-house scheduling, messaging, hosting, etc. Our vision for OpenMic is that it can act as a Public Access Channel for Nouns, where anyone can show up and spin up a Space with a built-in audience to iterate and try things out, but without the high administrative burden on TNS.\n\nAs a result of these and other changes to our day-to-day operations, we were able to stretch our previous mandate from 6 months to 9 months, and are presenting today a proposal that is almost 60% leaner than previoius asks.  \n\n\n\n---\n\n# 5) Promising Progress on Self-Funding & Alternative Funding Sources\n\nOne of our primary goals in Season 2 was to explore alternate sources of funding to become more self-sufficient as an organization, and we have explored this priority from three main angles: 1) Sponsorship collaborations, 2) Grants from other sources, and 3) Crypto Native revenue generation. \n\nOn item 1, we were able to negotiate 4 collaborations with values-aligned organizations plus a one-off video commission, for a total ETH value of 5.5 ETH. Thank you to Dawn Wallet, Gnars DAO and OnChainMonkey for being open to these collaborations so far. We are currently in discussions with various other organizations and protocols as well for future month-long content sponsorship opportunities. \n\nSecondly, we were extremely grateful to be awarded a Gitcoin Public Goods grant of 2.5 ETH for outstanding work in Web 3 Education and Onboarding, and a 5 ETH grant from Builder DAO to seed the imminently launching Yellow Collective treasury with funds to be used for nounish art contests and content commissions.\n\nAnd finally, we have brought in a total of 9.14 ETH YTD from our NOMO Nouns Daily Edition mints over the course of Season 2. We have also been iterating and evolving the NOMO collection and experience to make it more accessible for our audience. This summer, we migrated the collection to the Optimism L2 to solve the problem of a $7 daily mint that was costing $50 in gas to mint. Recently, we also made the decision to lower the mint cost from ~$7 to ~$1 to again encourage more broad participation from our community on a daily basis. \n\nWith these four sources combined, we have so far raised **22.14 ETH in outside revenue and grants, and we hope to double this amount in Season 3.**\n\nOne way that we will attempt to do that is with the launch of The Yellow Collective, a new TNS onchain club that will be deployed this month as a daily nounish auction on the BASE L2 using Nouns Builder. \n\n\n\n---\n\n# 6) Nouns on the OP Stack\n\n[![op-stack-infinity-stones-meme.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/j5LfcxDh/op-stack-infinity-stones-meme.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/JDCt4Wcy)\n\nWe noticed an interesting problem when talking to our community: Many wanted to \"Enjoy Ethereum\", but they were fed up with paying high gas fees on mainnet to do so. We decided to make it part of our mandate to teach our 50,000+ followers across socials about the benefits of using OP Stack L2 chains, and show them exactly how to do it.\n\nFirst, we migrated our daily edition collection \"NOMO Nouns\" from mainnet to OP, and produced some helpful tutorials on how to bridge ETH. Next, we started minting our Zero Rights Reserved podcasts as FREE mint collectibles on Zora L2 (shout out Jacob for helping us with this rollout.) \n\nFinally, we are in the midst of launching a \"DAO\" (onchain club) on BASE L2 using Nouns Builder this month, called The Yellow Collective. This Collective will be primarily focused on empowering artists and creatives through art contests and commissions, with collection art created by our community for our community. Check out the results of our **[Prop House Round for the first 50 heads here](https://prop.house/the-yellow-collective/the-yellow-collective-trait-contest-1:-best-noun-heads)**, and learn more about our plans for The Yellow Collective, and the BASE-deployed \"Collective Nouns\" daily auctions in our **[official announcement thread here.](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1704895027401417019?s=20)**\n\nThis diagram may also help to illustrate our three-pronged strategy for educating the Nouns community about the OP Stack, and the importance of Ethereum L2s:\n[![cr-w-2480-h-1240.webp](https://i.postimg.cc/mkHSPzMh/cr-w-2480-h-1240.webp)](https://postimg.cc/dZJCX05K)\n\n\nOne of our core ideals as an organization is to help create a safe and accessible place for people from all over the world to be able to Enjoy Nouns, and we are excited to leverage these L2 initiatives to do exactly that.  \n\nAnd on top of that, we're also just very excited for these Collective Nouns auctions to start... just look at these community-drawn traits! \n\n[![yellow-collective-finalists.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/65L0kWhh/yellow-collective-finalists.gif)](https://prop.house/the-yellow-collective/the-yellow-collective-trait-contest-1:-best-noun-heads)\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Our Guiding Goals for Season 3:\n\n- Remain consistent with our daily Twitter/X spaces and continue our current upward trajectory of followers and engagement on that platform, which would bring us to more than 14,000 followers, and a 6-month total of 1 million+ content impressions.\n- Grow and improve both the podcast and our YouTube channel content (which is already the second-largest channel in the nouniverse with 450 subscribers and also the fastest-growing channel with 150% subscriber growth this year.) We are targeting a similar rate of growth to hit our goal of 1000 Subscribers. As a baseline, we plan to produce and distribute at least 30 high quality pieces of video content in Season 3. \n- Make Zero Rights Reserved our co-flagship production alongside Noun O' Clock LIVE, leaning into the current momentum. (We have already recorded 1 month of future episodes with exciting guests like Vinnie Hager and the founders of Unlonely, still to air.)\n- Allocate more time and resources on making and using short clips from past and future ZEROPOD episodes for use on TikTok, Instagram and YT shorts (which are great content in and of themselves and also great drivers of listeners and subscribers back to the podcast.)\n- Double the total amount of funding from TNS initiatives and outside sources to at least 40 ETH. \n- Grow The Yellow Collective into the premiere nounish DAO (onchain club) on BASE as an accessible way for fans to discover nouns with the benefits of L2.  \n- Continue our mission of discovering and empowering nounish artists and creatives with the proceeds from daily auctions, running at least 20 contests for artists and creatives. \n- Update the Nouns community at minimum every 60 days with an onchain post on Propdates.wtf.\n\n# Budget and Requested Funding\n\nWe are requesting **130 ETH (~6 Nouns' worth at current FMV) for 6 months of operations** and our expected operational budgeting can be broken down as follows:\n\n-Art Contest Prizes Administration: 2 ETH/mo\n-Social Accounts Management: 3 ETH/mo\n-Spaces Hosting (NOC + All Others, Approx 50/month): 4.5 ETH/mo\n-Podcast organization, interviews, editing, production, distribution, etc: 4.5ETH/mo\n-Other Video Content Production and Distribution (This Week in Nouns, educational content, nouns project highlights, etc.): 3 ETH/mo\n-Short content creation and distribution for TikTok, instagram, YT reels, etc.: 1.5 ETH/mo\n-General Administration (Event Scheduling, Interview Scheduling, Prize Distribution, etc): 3 ETH/mo\n\n**Total expected budget operational cost per month: 21.5 ETH = 130 ETH Total**\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Core Team:**\n-**[Toady Hawk:](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk)** Project management, strategy, Spaces hosting, podcast hosting, video ideation, production, editing & distribution, social media management, administration.\n-**[Robotfishgirl](https://twitter.com/RobotFishGirl)**: Spaces hosting, discord moderation, strategy\n-**[JackWyldes:](https://twitter.com/JackWyldes)** Video ideation, production, hosting, editing.\n-**[Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi)**: Prize distribution, discord admin, strategy.\n-**[Xargs:](https://twitter.com/mamaxargs)** Discord admin, general administration, scheduling, international outreach\n-**[Santhosh:](https://)** Scheduling, video editing, short video editing\n-**[Joshua Fisher](https://twitter.com/JoshuaFisher)**: Art Contest Coordination and administration\n-**[Symbiotech:](https://twitter.com/Symbiotech)** Social media management, Discord moderation, NOMO community\n\n**Other Contributors:** [Cardno](https://twitter.com/CardnoNFT), [BrettDrawsStuff](https://twitter.com/BrettDrawsStuff), [Nikki](https://twitter.com/web3nikki), [JP](https://twitter.com/eusou_jp), [Davin](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye), [SuperTightWoody](https://twitter.com/SuperTightWoody), [Macki](https://twitter.com/_mackinac), [Satori](https://twitter.com/0xSatori).\n\nCore Team will collaborate to allocate funds to team members based on their contributions to the **weekly operations tasks budgets** outlined above.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Trusted 3/6 Multisig Members:**\nRobotfishgirl\nBenbodhi\nSupertightWoody\n[Maty.eth](https://twitter.com/matyETH)\nToady Hawk\n[Noun 142](https://twitter.com/noun142)\n\n\n\n---\n\n**We would like to thank Nouns for all of the opportunity and trust you have given TNS over the past 18 months, and we ask for your continued support here as we set out to do more with less and make an increasingly positive and tangible impact on the Nouniverse over the next 6 months.**\n\nIf you have any questions for us about the Proposal, please don't hesitate to pose a question here onchain, DM or post on X/Twitter or Farcaster @thenounsquare, or drop in our [TNS Discord](https://discord.gg/vh9TQbtR). \n\n**LFG!

Our decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focuses on gathering, utilizing, managing, and improving idle assets like unused houses and cars within communities worldwide. My fellow co-founder at Enabler DAO,¬†**[yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth)**, is a holder of¬†**[Noun 312](https://nouns.wtf/noun/312)**, and we believe in the power and potential of NounsDAO just as you do.\n\nWe are proposing a funding of¬†**47,600 USDC**¬†to give a Nounish makeover to a vacation rental property in Tokyo, Japan, valued over $1,000,000 USD. We intend to create ‚ÄúNouns House #1‚Äù with this funding. Our property has already completed interior and exterior renovations;¬†**all of the funding will be used for the Nounish makeover, and development of the mobile app.**\n\nBeyond just providing the property for Nouns House #1,¬†**we will contribute 10% of the profits made from Nouns House #1 to the Nouns House DAO treasury for the first 5 years**. For future Nouns Houses real estates that are funded by the treasury, 100% of the profits will be returned to the treasury.\n\nIn alignment with NounsDAO‚Äôs¬†CC0 philosophy, we will make all software and hardware implemented in this project open source. Furthermore, we plan to collaborate with the Nouns projects that are active in Japan such as¬†**[pNouns](https://pnouns.wtf/en/)**¬†(**[Noun 553](https://nouns.wtf/noun/553)**,¬†**[Noun 556](https://nouns.wtf/noun/556)**) for events and promotions.\n\n**The diverse industry experience of our team will significantly contribute to the success of this project.**¬†**[yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth)**¬†is a former executive CPO at Mercari,¬†**[yukill.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukill.eth)**¬†is a former CEO at ZOZO Technologies,¬†**[Jiro](https://twitter.com/jiroisagame)**¬†is a former YouTuber with 1.3 million subscribers, and I,¬†**[tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth)**, am a former engineer from Amazon Seattle.\n\nThis proposal was inspired by¬†**[Nouns Deli](https://twitter.com/NounsDeli)**‚Äôs proposal (**[Proposal 254](https://nouns.wtf/vote/254)**, approved on 03/09/2023). Our next step is to establish a Nounish subDAO, called ‚ÄúNouns House DAO‚Äù. Similar to the¬†**[Nouns Builder Protocol](https://nouns.build/)**¬†(**[Proposal 167](https://nouns.wtf/vote/167)**, approved on 11/12/2022), we aim to create a subDAO inheriting NounsDAO‚Äôs auction, treasury, and governance system. In the follow-up proposal, we plan to request initial funding for Nouns House DAO treasury, in order to create Nouns House #2 and subsequent Nouns Houses based on community decisions governed by the DAO.\n\n## 1.  Nouns House DAO ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n\nNouns House #1 created through this proposal will serve as the first Nouns House governed by Nouns House DAO. Following the successful execution of this proposal, we will submit a follow-up proposal to transfer initial funding to the Nouns House DAO treasury. This initial funding will be substantial enough to secure the purchase of the second Nouns House. The exact amount, along with detailed plans and specific property information, will be disclosed in this follow-up proposal. We believe that having initial funding in the treasury will create strong momentum for this new Nounish DAO.\n\nOur goal is to establish Nouns Houses in major cities globally, allowing individuals to experience Nouns art and culture. Additionally, we aim to¬†**operate this as a profitable venture**, positioning Nouns House DAO as the pioneering Nounish subDAO that introduces a¬†**3rd revenue pillar for the treasury, complementing the NFT auctioning and ETH staking.**\n\nNouns House DAO will oversee the operation and financial management of all Nouns Houses.¬†**As a testament to our commitment, we will contribute 10% of the profits from Nouns House #1 to treasury for the first 5 years.**¬†For all subsequent real estates that are funded by the Nouns House DAO treasury, 100% of the profits will be directed back to the treasury.\n\n![Bedroom](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1W23f_T6aANo9mXh9-lUu3bypKSzU12M4)\n\n## 2. Enabler DAO / Core Team ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n\nEnabler DAO is a asset sharing community that aims to facilitate easy sharing of large assets like houses and cars by leveraging blockchain and AI technology.¬†As of November 2023, we operate 10 properties across 5 locations (Tokyo, Kyoto, Atami, Teshikaga, and Honolulu) in Japan and the United States. These properties are monetized through asset sharing within the community as well as through Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) such as Airbnb and Booking.com.

Nounish Makeover ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n\nWe plan to transform our property in Aoyama, an upscale district in Tokyo, into \"Nouns House #1,\" with a Nounish makeover filled with art and goodies. \n\n![Living Room](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bwo_xZOKns30glLVRyeoQ7ROKojrQkIE)\n\nAoyama is a hub of designer boutiques, art galleries, cafes, and shopping districts. It's not only a attracts for affluent individuals but also a popular tourist destination. Given the area's reputation and successful track record of our nearby properties, **we anticipate strong demand for high-end vacation rental property in Aoyama.**\n\n![Sauna](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1kabDge7tB6HDlZqn1fYccFdnsMt0-AdX)\n\nIn recent years, there has been a ‚Äúsauna boom‚Äù in Japan. The number of sauna enthusiasts has been increasing due to heightened health consciousness and the proliferation of sauna facilities. In fact, the number of sauna users in Japan has increased by more than one million in the past year, and high-end sauna facilities in Tokyo are extremely popular. **We believe that Nouns House #1 will become widely popular within the sauna communities and beyond.**\n\n![Bath](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=190MOtkZF68sFwLUJzwbxoO4hNEtKDfch)\n\nThe artwork used for interior and exterior of Nouns House #1 will be directed by [amiyoko.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/amiyoko.eth) who have contributed many artwork to various Nouns projects such as NounsDAO Anniversary Art 2023 and Sushi Nouns.\n\n![Exterior](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bESaiRK3zLewixG-8MvEEq9HgIhnkbqc)\n\nThe 1st floor is the sauna area, the 2nd floor features a living-dining-kitchen area, and the 3rd floor will be an office space and a bedroom.

Marketing Efforts **‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n\nTo amplify the presence of Nouns House #1, **we will be forming a strategic partnership with a popular Japanese YouTuber group, [EvisJap](https://youtube.com/@EvisJap?si=6Oi6Ll6fIzis70ib).** With a subscriber base of 630,000, primarily young adults, they are known for their energetic travel blogs and lively social gatherings that resonate with the adventurous spirit of youth.\n\nDuring the weekdays, EvisJap will be utilizing Nouns House #1 as their recording studio, bringing a creative buzz to the space while providing regular exposure of Nouns to a broad audience through their videos. On weekends, Nouns House #1 will transform into an luxury private sauna. This dual-use approach optimizes the utility of the property, and exemplifies the innovative and adaptive spirit of the Nouns.\n\nThis collaboration, born from our unique relationship with EbisJap, is a synergy that offers exposure to Nouns House without direct marketing efforts. The value of this organic promotion is an example of the unique contribution that our team brings to the Nouns community.\n\n## **5. Mobile App ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n\n**We will develop a mobile app for facilitating reservations and assigning maintenance work for Nouns House DAO**. This app will be powered by open-source framework called¬†**[Skeet](https://skeet.dev/en/)**¬†which seamlessly integrates with Google Cloud Platform and Firebase, making it easier to develop serverless full-stack applications. \n\nIt's worth noting that both Enabler and¬†**[El Soul Labo](https://labo.elsoul.nl/en/)**, the team behind Skeet, received equity funding from¬†**[East Ventures](https://east.vc/)**, one of the biggest venture capital fund in Asia. With the cutting edge Skeet framework and the invaluable support from the creator of Skeet, we can efficiently develop this app with just one engineer on our end.\n\nThe app will integrate with existing tools that offers API such as¬†**[Beds24](https://beds24.com/)**¬†for inventory management,¬†**[Sesame Smart Lock](https://jp.candyhouse.co/)**¬†for automatically issuing one-time guest keys, and¬†**[Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-jp)**¬†for fiat payment processing. In the interim, before our app release, we'll use¬†**[LINE](https://line.me/en/)**¬†and¬†**[LINE Marketplace](https://line-marketplace.com/jp/app)**¬†apps for chat-based reservation.\n\nFurthermore, we will incorporate web3 capabilities such as token-gating and cryptocurrency payment into the app. We plan to offer special coupons and priority reservations to Nouns House NFT holders, and allow payments in major cryptocurrencies.\n\n## **6. Utility Token ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n\nWe plan to introduce a utility token which will be used for accessing Nouns House and can be earned through completing maintenance gigs listed in the app. **We envision some members of the Nouns House DAO to work maintenance gigs in order to earn the utility token.** We plan to use Solana chain for the token for 3 reasons: near-zero gas fees, rapid execution, and its integration with the user-friendly multi-chain wallet called Phantom. Enabler DAO has already been experimenting with Solana based utility token called [**EBR**](https://solscan.io/token/E1JxwaWRd8nw8vDdWMdqwdbXGBshqDcnTcinHzNMqg2Y) (available on [**Orca DEX**](https://v1.orca.so/liquidity/browse?tokenMint=E1JxwaWRd8nw8vDdWMdqwdbXGBshqDcnTcinHzNMqg2Y)) and have experience in this realm.\n\n## **7. Roadmap ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n\nWe will begin the Nounish makeover and the development of mobile app, immediately following the approval of this proposal.¬†In January 2024, we plan to pre-open Nouns House #1, followed by grand opening in February. Beta version of mobile app will be released in March, followed by production release in April. We will submit submit a follow-up proposal by Feburary 2024 to transfer initial funding for the DAO treasury followed by successful execution of this proposal.\n\n![Roadmap](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1xkl6xzFYEi-rAtpjmnARWpc34Pj_Dlh4)\n\n## **8. Budget ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n\nWe are proposing **47,600 USDC funding for creating Nouns House #1 and to kick start the software infrastructure development for Nouns House DAO.**¬†The Nounish makeover will cost $17,000, and the development of the mobile app will cost $30,600. All work will commence immediately upon the approval of the proposal.\n\n**Nouns House #1 Nounish Makeover: $17,000**\n- \"Nounish\" Exterior Wall Art: $6,000\n- \"Nounish\" Interior Art: $8,000\n- \"Nounish\" Goodies: $3,000\n\n**Mobile App (6-month development): $30,600**\n- Founding Engineer: $5,000/month\n- [Skeet](https://skeet.dev/en/)¬†(Enterprise Support): $100/month\n\n## **9. Community Benefits ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n\nThis proposal aims to **expand the Nouns community by creating the first \"Nouns House\", a network of properties where people can experience Nouns art and culture in major cities worldwide.**\n\nIn the next step, we will propose to transfer initial funding for Nouns House DAO treasury. This new Nounish subDAO will own Real World Asset (RWA) and operate them as a profit-making business. RWA is an area where the web3 industry is still struggling, and this new venture has the potential to significantly advance the industry on this front.\n\nNouns House NFT holders will be offered special perks such as discounted rates and priority access to Nouns Houses via token gating. Additionally, upon the funding of the Nouns House DAO treasury in our next proposal,¬†**existing Nouns NFT holders can apply for Nouns House NFT airdrop by a pre-determined date**. This airdrop is optional and provides an opportunity for existing NounsDAO members to participate in the governance for Nouns House DAO without having to bid in the auction.\n\n## **10. CC0 ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n\nWe believe, Nouns House‚Äôs CC0 culture will bring innovation to the real estate industry. While real estate design and architecture are generally not open-source, we will make all of these publicly available through our CC0 library. CC0 approach will also have a large impact on the vacation rental industry. **By providing tools to help achieve efficient operations, we will accelerate the automation and digital transformation of the vacation rental industry.**¬†The interest and attention that this CC0 model will generate within these industries will serve as the ideal platform for spreading the culture and values of Nouns.\n\n## **11. Risks & Considerations ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n\nWe are enthusiastic members of the Nouns community and, as Noun owner, strongly resonate with the vision of Nouns. **We believe that the Nouns model holds innovative power in asset management and vacation rental fields.** This decentralized, community-led governance model has the potential to offer new approaches in asset sharing and feels like the ideal way to manage assets in a decentralized manner. On the other hand, there are some risks considered in achieving the vision of this project:\n\n1. **Regulatory Risk**: Operating within a decentralized framework could potentially make the project subject to regulations. Compliance with local laws is crucial.\n2. **Technical Risk**: The integration of blockchain technology with physical assets like real estate presents several challenges. The implementation of smart contracts to manage the property must be executed flawlessly.\n3. **Community Engagement**: The strength of a DAO lies in its community. For long-term success, it's important to maintain community engagement and participation in governance.\n\nBy acknowledging these risks and proactively addressing them, we aim for the success of the Nouns House project."},{"blockNumber":18558691,"blockHash":"0x01b8780ce1388706e62ad49dcb69c53b3b2d574c47f1462838287266190be80a","transactionIndex":86,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x3256acb978d66695989d4c7c631b94115f99091567c0be4940dfa376e8201b5f","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":438,"proposer":"0xdcf37d8Aa17142f053AAA7dc56025aB00D897a19","signers":["0xae4705dC0816ee6d8a13F1C72780Ec5021915Fed"],"targets":["0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03","0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03"],"signatures":["safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)","safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef7100000000000000000000000066cd193d0c0fb3b9b44dd371107617a7e9f381840000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000064","0x000000000000000000000000b1a32fc9f9d8b2cf86c068cae13108809547ef7100000000000000000000000035f2a10b73aa0b5d8dc6639c51af7d5ddcd1846a0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000225"],"startBlock":18580291,"endBlock":18609091,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18576691,"proposalThreshold":0,"quorumVotes":38,"description":"# Gift Nouns to Nounish Founders: Lil Nounders\n\n**tl;dr - Honor early founders of nounish communities: Lil Nounders**\n\nThis is the third of a set of proposals to gift Nouns to the founders of the first three Nouns forks who proliferated Nouns via unique iterations of nounish DAOs which evolved into the largest nounish communities today.\n\nI feel the reputation of these founders precedes them, so I'll be brief.

The intentions back then was to: \n* Make it easier for long-time nouners to fork if they felt fundamentally misaligned with the direction Nouns was accelerating towards in season 3 (post-fork 0).\n* Reduce the daily treasury leak to arbitrageurs by making arb easier (and thus more competitive) while figuring out thoughtful acceleration of spend to lower BV naturally.\n\nNow, a month and a half later, we've mostly cleared those intentions:\n* [Fork 1](https://nouns.wtf/fork/1) occurred and long-time nouners that felt fundamentally misaligned (such as poap and beautifulnfts) joined the fork. We're not seeing additional forks being initiated by long-time nouners.\n* Book value has been lowered from the mid-30 ETH range to mid-20 ETH range through important bets on [Gnars ($300k)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/382), [Nouns Stories + Stoopid Buddy ($1.8M)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/397), [Protocol Guild Animation Film ($400k)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/407), [Nounish ($1M)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/413), [Messhup's Graphic Novel ($100k)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/423), [Rise of Blus ($1.1M)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/425), and likely [The Nouns Square ($270k)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/434). Happy with these high conviction bets.\n\nNow that we don't really need to worry about (for the time being) fundamentally misaligned long-time nouners being stuck in the DAO, we're in a position of mostly just dealing with arbitrageurs.\n\nI wouldn't be a proponent of raising the fork threshold if that meant arbitraguers would just accumulate more Nouns for longer, but given that the BV is now already lower, [arb modelling by the Verbs team](https://mirror.xyz/verbsteam.eth/W4gaOrp6NC6jopc6vGsGuhz3o4ej0G_0TFhBlcLed94) is showing that if we raise the fork threshold to 30% the expected BV at next fork would be in the low-10 ETH range, which means that if the true market clearing price is above that then we should start seeing real buyers outbid the arbitrageurs immediately.\n\nWe could just wait out a few more months for BV to naturally lower and the problem to resolve itself, but the benefits of adding new DAO members and getting true price discovery sooner in my opinion outweighs the governance overhead of adjusting the fork threshold and thus I propose we raise the fork threshold to 30% now."},{"blockNumber":18564816,"blockHash":"0x10f76b5a907f76bcfd54375cf7ceac9514f0eac6ae5c2fb4407b3858c14215c7","transactionIndex":116,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x0bbdc0fbace5272b4887d7e4d10c18478ba704852b8363079b12892f7006bc16","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":440,"proposer":"0xF952A0788137Cef8Cba0B315a042262Ddc12c3aF","signers":["0x5fC3aFaeeF0fF1149cee3bd80C1B20DE629dF880"],"targets":["0xd97Bcd9f47cEe35c0a9ec1dc40C1269afc9E8E1D"],"signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000001cd2f6a466e12136a9e0b691bf86b0ca5f7a70ec0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001176592e00"],"startBlock":18586416,"endBlock":18615216,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18582816,"proposalThreshold":0,"quorumVotes":38,"description":"# One Noun, Every Day, Forever... in an Action Rogue-Lite Game!

We will also explore the game mechanics and creative direction with the Nouns community to discover product-market fit.\n\nPlay our pre-production demo [here](https://thepixelshop.itch.io/nounstown-demo)!\n\n# A Vertical Slice of One Noun, Every Day\n\n![stage_nouns_v_souls.png](https://i.imgur.com/hK0MOWs.png)\n\n**The One Noun, Every Day game mode will be the hook and anchor behind this game.  We want to re-imagine the continuity and diversity of Nouns through the lens of a dynamic and captivating game for the masses**.  \n\nJust as each blockchain hash determines the traits for each noun, every day, we will use a game seed to generate new elements for a each game, every day.  These changing elements include Nouns equipped with fun and diverse items, a generative world map populated with vibrant environments, random upgrades available to select from, and enemy minions and bosses you must battle to win.  Every player will have a 24 hour rolling period to defeat each version of the game.  This innovative mechanic has the potential to fuel a social and competitive gaming culture due to the following reasons:\n\n- Replayability - Optimize gameplay strategies through trial and error as you explore new characters and maps\n- Progression - Unlock new content and playable characters to use in the ‚ÄúClassic Mode‚Äù by defeating the game and a robust achievement system\n- Competition - Compete against all other players for the fastest clear time, and more importantly, bragging rights!\n- Game Metas - Discover unpredictable metas in a dynamic Nounish world\n\n## **Funding Details and Deliverables**\n\n**We are asking for $75,000 to develop a polished and playable vertical slice of the One Noun, Every Day game loop to demonstrate our intended player experience.** \n\nThis funding request provides for a $65,000 production budget (approximately 1,500 hours) and a $10,000 marketing budget, over an approximately 3-month period.  Key features required to produce this vertical slice include player character design, items and upgrades, environment design, sound design, UI/UX, and a single boss encounter.  Each feature will go through design and documentation, art and animation, programming and development, sound design, and testing and quality assurance, as applicable.  The deliverables and estimated allocation are as follows:\n\n- 1 Boss Encounter - 20 percent or 300 hours\n- Generative Map and Environment Assets - 20 percent or 300 hours\n- 7 Items and 7 Upgrades - 15 percent or 225 hours\n- 7 Rotating Nouns Characters - 15 percent or 225 hours\n- Sound design for completed features - 10 percent or 150 hours\n- Functional UI/UX for Menus and Gameplay - 10 percent or 150 hours\n- Comprehensive Game Design Document - 10 percent or 150 hours\n\nWe have allocated a marketing budget of $10,000 to produce the following deliverables:\n\n- Branding and Marketing Assets\n- Establish Social Media presence and Steam Page\n- Professional Teaser Trailer\n\n# Creative Direction\n\n## Nouns\n\nOur game embraces a clash of two starkly contrasting worlds. On one side, the Nounish personality will be at the core of the player character, the items and upgrades you acquire during each run, and NPCs you discover over time.  These elements will be designed to permeate Nounish personality through vibrant colors, joyful energy, and whimsical ideas. \n\n### Items\n\nWe are exploring ideas that are ‚Äúoutside of the box‚Äù and consistent with the outlandish and diversely strange Nouns world.  \n\n### Upgrades\n\nAs the player clears each room,  they are rewarded a pair of Noggles that unlocks a powerful new upgrade to use during the run.  Players will experiment with different combinations of upgrades to create fun synergies and provide a unique gameplay experience each run.  Each upgrade is inspired by various characters from the Nouns collection.  \n\n## Forgotten Souls\n\nAnd on the other side, you'll uncover the corrupt Forgotten Souls that have crossed into the Nouniverse upon discovering the power of Noggles.  The Souls are holding Nouns captive in their inanimate forms and using the power from the stolen Noggles to convert the Nouniverse into their own shadowy realm.  The Souls will serve as the enemy minions, bosses, and antagonist of our game, designed with contrasting dark personalities and colors.  \n\n### Minions\n\nAll minions will be designed to showcase their haunting personalities through fantastical and diverse character design, animations, and attack styles.  The contrasting nature of the minions will provide for an aesthetic design that emphasizes readability and a visual feeling of cleansing the corruption from Nouns Town as the player progresses.  \n\n![Minions](https://i.imgur.com/aZx9FC4.png)\n\n### Bosses\n\nOur boss encounters thrive to be one of the more memorable experiences that you will encounter in our game.  Our bosses will be inspired by rare Forgotten Souls characters but have our own stylistic flare.  These boss encounters will be visually stunning and paired with cohesive game play mechanics that immerse and challenge the player.  \n\n## Environment\n\nThe collision of these two distinct moods creates a captivating experience.  Each run will begin as a corrupt Nouniverse that has taken over by the Souls.  As the player progresses through the map, the corruption is pushed back and the vibrant Nounish world is slowly restored!  \n\nWe‚Äôll design Nounish locations with their own distinct aesthetics and corresponding play styles.  Each location on the map will go through a similar design process and produce the following deliverables:\n\n- Concept Design - Establish the location‚Äôs identity with clearly defined characteristics\n- Map Assets - Represent each location by a low resolution design on the map\n- Tile Sets -  Outfit the walls, floors, and objects within the rooms of each location.  The following tile set was used in our demo and will receive a Nounish update:\n    ![Demo Tileset](https://i.imgur.com/Bc2Ms0C.png)\n- Decorations and Objects - Fill each room with decorations for personality and destructible objects for an interactive setting\n\n## Creative Commons\n\nAll of the art and animations that we produce will be open-source and available for anyone to use!\n\n# Future Vision\n\n**The goal of this proposal is to ‚Äúfollow the fun‚Äù through addicting game play and Nounish creative expressions.  However, we have a long term vision to produce and distribute a fully fleshed out Nouns indie game.**\n\n### Additional Classic Mode\n\nOur core game loop will be the One Noun, Every Day game mode.  However, as the player character and map remain constant in this game mode, we also plan to release a Classic Mode to serve as a more traditional rogue-lite focused on randomness and meta progression, or progression that exists outside of regular gameplay.  In this mode, no two runs will be the same as a fresh new map is generated with each play through.  \n\nBut there‚Äôs also significant depth beyond the randomness.  This mode will be accompanied with a robust achievement system that challenges the player to unlock exciting new items, upgrades, and cosmetics.  \n\n### Organic Growth\n\nDuring development, we‚Äôll maintain a steady pipeline of project updates, promotional content, and social engagement to generate organic growth.  Additionally, we plan to attend major game development conventions such as GDC, PAX, and Gamescon to engage with our community in person.  \n\n### Game Distribution\n\nWe will use Steam as our primary distribution platform to release the game.  Steam provides access to the largest PC gaming community, as well as extensive marketing and analytics features.  We will explore porting the game to Nintendo Switch post-release to reach a wider audience.\n\n## Collaboration\n\n### Nouns Community\n\nWe are committed to an open and inclusive collaboration process throughout production.  We will regularly engage with select community members to explore creative discussions, validate game design concepts, and explore marketing opportunities.  Our goal is to create an immersive game that represents the Nounish identity and resonates with both the community and the player.  \n\n### Forgotten Runes Wizard‚Äôs Cult\n\nThe game will be in collaboration with our friends from the Forgotten Runes Wizard‚Äôs Cult.  Their team is well-respected and produce engaging and high-quality products and experiences.  This collaboration brings promotional support from both their community and team‚Äôs established network within the gaming, content creation, and entertainment industries.  This partnership presents an opportunity to elevate our game, expand its reach, and enhance the prospect for breakout success.\n\n### Nouns Esports\n\nWe will collaborate with Nouns Esports to generate excitement and promotional content with the game launch.  This partnership will explore ideas to engage the Nouns gaming community primarily through streaming, competitions, and giveaways.  \n\n# Why a Nounish indie game?\n\nA rogue-lite indie game provides a compelling opportunity for Nouns to enter the gaming sector:\n\n### Creative Expression\n\nIndie games provide for a perfect landscape to build a Nounish world complete with innovative game mechanics that are complimented with vibrant aesthetics and visual representation.  We aim to populate our world with original Nouns characters, an outlandish environment, and charming storytelling to engage players and cultivate a connection to Nouns culture.    \n\n### Strategic Advantages\n\nOur small indie team provides several advantages including streamlined communication, transparency, adaptability, and a strong team synergy.  Yet, while being a small team, we have access to powerful platforms such as Godot for development, Steam for distribution, and social media and Discord for our community.  Our game is thoughtfully designed to pack a punch with addictive gameplay mechanics, engaging progression and replayability, and long-term scalability and new content.  We‚Äôre able to accomplish all of this within a reasonable scope and production budget, and without sacrificing on the game‚Äôs entertainment or aesthetics.\n\n## Genre\n\nOur genre of choice may be a mouthful (Non Linear Action Rogue-Lite Bullet Hell‚Ä¶) but it‚Äôs a great platform for a Nouns game.  The generative rogue features share a strong parallel with the Nounish identity; bullet hells offer replayability.  We have described the key features of each sub-genres and the games that inspire us below:\n\n### Rogue-Lite\n\nThe key feature of a Rogue-Lite genre is a game loop that results in permadeath.  Each time a player begins their attempt or run, they will either defeat the final boss or die trying.  A Rogue-Lite game generally involves some meta progression that takes place outside of the run; usually in the form of upgraded items, statistics, abilities, or skill trees.\n\n### Bullet Hell\n\nBullet Hell combat mechanics emphasize complex bullet patterns for the player to navigate and dodge.  Our bullet hell game will be designed as a twin stick shooter where the player is on a flat plane with a top-down perspective.  \n\n### Non-Linear Progression\n\nOne of the unique selling points of our Rogue-Lite game is that it will have Non-Linear progression.  The two main features to highlight in this design include a unique map that is generated each run and the freedom for the player to decide their order of progression.   \n\n### Inspiration\n[Enter the Gungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/), [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/), [Risk of Rain 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/), [Nuclear Throne](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/Nuclear_Throne/), [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/)\n\n# Why The Pixel Shop?\n\n![The Pixel Shop](https://i.imgur.com/57yu7tx.png)\n\n[The Pixel Shop](https://thepixelshop.app) is an independent Art and Game Development studio founded in March 2022.

We will also explore the game mechanics and creative direction with the Nouns community to discover product-market fit.\n\nChanges from [Prop 414 (Version 1)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/414):\n- Focused attention on our One Noun, Every Day core mechanic and game play \n- Expanded on creative direction and process to capture the Nounish personality\n- Provided a detailed scope for the vertical slice deliverables\n- Added long term vision for collaboration with the Nouns community, and strategy partnerships with Nouns Esports and Forgotten Runes Wizard's Cult\n\n**Play our pre-production Demo [HERE](https://thepixelshop.itch.io/nounstown-demo)!**\n\n# A Vertical Slice of One Noun, Every Day\n\n![stage_nouns_v_souls.png](https://i.imgur.com/pBTUbZl.png)\n\n**The One Noun, Every Day game mode will be the hook and anchor behind this game.  We want to re-imagine the continuity and diversity of Nouns through the lens of a dynamic and captivating game for the masses**.  \n\nJust as each blockchain hash determines the traits for each noun, every day, we will use a game seed to generate new elements for a each game, every day.  These changing elements include Nouns equipped with fun and diverse items, a generative world map populated with vibrant environments, random upgrades available to select from, and enemy minions and bosses you must battle to win.  Every player will have a 24 hour rolling period to defeat each version of the game.  This innovative mechanic has the potential to fuel a social and competitive gaming culture due to the following reasons:\n\n- Replayability - Optimize gameplay strategies through trial and error as you explore new characters and maps\n- Progression - Unlock new content and playable characters to use in the ‚ÄúClassic Mode‚Äù by defeating the game and a robust achievement system\n- Competition - Compete against all other players for the fastest clear time, and more importantly, bragging rights!\n- Game Metas - Discover unpredictable metas in a dynamic Nounish world\n\n## **Funding Details and Deliverables**\n\n**We are asking for $75,000 to develop a polished and playable vertical slice of the One Noun, Every Day game loop to demonstrate our intended player experience.** \n\nThis funding request provides for a $65,000 production budget (approximately 1,500 hours) and a $10,000 marketing budget, over an approximately 3-month period.  Key features required to produce this vertical slice include player character design, items and upgrades, environment design, sound design, UI/UX, and a single boss encounter.  Each feature will go through design and documentation, art and animation, programming and development, sound design, and testing and quality assurance, as applicable.  The deliverables and estimated allocation are as follows:\n\n- 1 Boss Encounter - 20 percent or 300 hours\n- Generative Map and Environment Assets - 20 percent or 300 hours\n- 7 Items and 7 Upgrades - 15 percent or 225 hours\n- 7 Rotating Nouns Characters - 15 percent or 225 hours\n- Sound design for completed features - 10 percent or 150 hours\n- Functional UI/UX for Menus and Gameplay - 10 percent or 150 hours\n- Comprehensive Game Design Document - 10 percent or 150 hours\n\nWe have allocated a marketing budget of $10,000 to produce the following deliverables:\n\n- Branding and Marketing Assets\n- Establish Social Media presence and Steam Page\n- Professional Teaser Trailer\n\n# Creative Direction\n![Comic Strip](https://i.imgur.com/Aw5LE39.png)\n## Nouns\n\nOur game embraces a clash of two starkly contrasting worlds. On one side, the Nounish personality will be at the core of the player character, the items and upgrades you acquire during each run, and NPCs you discover over time.  These elements will be designed to permeate Nounish personality through vibrant colors, joyful energy, and whimsical ideas. \n\n### Items\n\nWe are exploring ideas that are ‚Äúoutside of the box‚Äù and consistent with the outlandish and diversely strange Nouns world.  These items will be packed with personality but also provide distinct play styles.  Early concepts we have explored include the Gnome Chuckaz, Sliced Bread Shurikens, and Pinata Blitzers:\n![item concepts](https://i.imgur.com/i2ciy7e.png)\n*Concept design for potential items*\n### Upgrades\n\nAs the player clears each room,  they are rewarded a pair of Noggles that unlocks a powerful new upgrade to use during the run.  Players will experiment with different combinations of upgrades to create fun synergies and provide a unique gameplay experience each run.  Each upgrade is inspired by various characters from the Nouns collection. \n![upgrade concepts](https://i.imgur.com/rUVjlxX.png) \n\n\n## Forgotten Souls\n\nAnd on the other side, you'll uncover the corrupt Forgotten Souls that have crossed into the Nouniverse upon discovering the power of Noggles.  The Souls are holding Nouns captive in their inanimate forms and using the power from the stolen Noggles to convert the Nouniverse into their own shadowy realm.  The Souls will serve as the enemy minions, bosses, and antagonist of our game, designed with contrasting dark personalities and colors.  \n\n### Minions\n\nAll minions will be designed to showcase their haunting personalities through fantastical and diverse character design, animations, and attack styles.  The contrasting nature of the minions will provide for an aesthetic design that emphasizes readability and a visual feeling of cleansing the corruption from Nouns Town as the player progresses.  \n![Minions](https://i.imgur.com/aZx9FC4.png)\n\n\n### Bosses\n\nOur boss encounters thrive to be one of the more memorable experiences that you will encounter in our game.  Our bosses will be inspired by rare Forgotten Souls characters but have our own stylistic flare.  These boss encounters will be visually stunning and paired with cohesive game play mechanics that immerse and challenge the player.  \n\n## Environment\n\nThe collision of these two distinct moods creates a captivating experience.  Each run will begin as a corrupt Nouniverse that has taken over by the Souls.  As the player progresses through the map, the corruption is pushed back and the vibrant Nounish world is slowly restored!  \n\n![World Concept](https://i.imgur.com/qC0bTvv.png)\n*Concept design for an environment that we will design a tile set for*\n\nWe‚Äôll design Nounish locations with their own distinct and colorful themes, from quaint towns and snowy wonderlands, to barren deserts and tropical beaches.  Each playable location will go through a similar design process and produce the following deliverables:\n\n- Concept Design - Establish the location‚Äôs identity with clearly defined characteristics\n- Map Assets - Represent each location by a low resolution design in the Overworld Map\n- Tile Sets -  Outfit the walls, floors, and objects within the rooms of each location.  \n- Decorations and Objects - Fill each room with decorations for personality and destructible objects for an interactive setting\n    ![Demo Tileset](https://i.imgur.com/Bc2Ms0C.png)\n*Concept tile set used in demo that will receive a Nounish update*\n## Creative Commons\n\nAll of the art and animations that we produce will be open-source and available for anyone to use!\n\n# Future Vision\n\n**The goal of this proposal is to ‚Äúfollow the fun‚Äù through addicting game play and Nounish creative expressions.  However, we have a long term vision to produce and distribute a fully fleshed out Nouns indie game.**\n\n### Additional Classic Mode\n\nOur core game loop will be the One Noun, Every Day game mode.  However, as the player character and map remain constant in this game mode, we also plan to release a Classic Mode to serve as a more traditional rogue-lite focused on randomness and meta progression, or progression that exists outside of regular gameplay.  In this mode, no two runs will be the same as a fresh new map is generated with each play through.  \n\nBut there‚Äôs also significant depth beyond the randomness.  This mode will be accompanied with a robust achievement system that challenges the player to unlock exciting new items, upgrades, and cosmetics.  \n\n### Organic Growth\n\nDuring development, we‚Äôll maintain a steady pipeline of project updates, promotional content, and social engagement to generate organic growth.  Additionally, we plan to attend major game development conventions such as GDC, PAX, and Gamescon to engage with our community in person.  \n\n### Game Distribution\n\nWe will use Steam as our primary distribution platform to release the game.

We will explore porting the game to Nintendo Switch post-release to reach a wider audience.\n\n## Collaboration\n\n### Nouns Community\n\nWe are committed to an open and inclusive collaboration process throughout production.

Support dealing with the arb with current protocol nobs.\n2. Pull audit funds back to the USDC payer contract.\n\n## Description\n\nThe original burn design was meant to mitigate the arb in the short term, and it did so by burning BV in excess of recent auction prices immediately, with no delay.\n\nThe spec changed to give voters more coordination time, and that led to the burn no longer mitigating short term arb.\n\nWe spent time discussing additional changes to combine with the burn, e.g. require noun age to fork, and decided it‚Äôs all too complex and the problem can be solved with existing tools.\n\nWe wrote [the arb analysis post](https://mirror.xyz/verbsteam.eth/W4gaOrp6NC6jopc6vGsGuhz3o4ej0G_0TFhBlcLed94) after this realization, hoping to provide voters with a framework on how to take action with protocol as it currently is.\n\nSince the burn in its current spec doesn‚Äôt solve the arb and seems to have lost some consensus and momentum, we suggest dropping it at least until the current arb problem is dramatically mitigated, i.e. BV is equal-ish to natural demand.\n\nOnce we‚Äôre in that reality we can revisit the value of adding the burn and certainly do so if there‚Äôs enough energy behind it!\n\n## Transaction\nWithdraw the audit funds from the Tech Grants multisig back to the Payer contract, which is where the DAO holds USDC to fund proposals.\n\n\nThanks!\nthe verbs ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® "},{"blockNumber":18614817,"blockHash":"0x2cbfd2fc296ff680baf99e4c7c61395e058a1acd3b69f0c3ec199d70ff18d519","transactionIndex":68,"address":"0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d","transactionHash":"0x98d3ee154251acb6d563b021a16093a0e0eaef90e74d8ee52ee5d710ef70d643","eventName":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements","eventSignature":"ProposalCreatedWithRequirements(uint256,address,address[],address[],uint256[],string[],bytes[],uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,string)","id":443,"proposer":"0x537e458B75A28F3B6529457d50a2047F28594947","signers":[],"targets":["0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d"],"signatures":["_setImplementation(address)"],"calldatas":["0x000000000000000000000000e3caa436461dba00cfbe1749148c9fa7fa1f5344"],"startBlock":18636417,"endBlock":18665217,"updatePeriodEndBlock":18632817,"proposalThreshold":0,"quorumVotes":33,"description":"# Nouns DAO V3.1 Minor Fix\n\n## TLDR\n\n- We deployed V3 with the same Vote with Refund bug [we fixed in V2.1](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/169).\n- This proposal upgrades the DAO with a minor fix.\n- This version is not audited; we‚Äôre confident enough with the internal review we conducted.\n\n## Fix summary\n\nChange the refund destination such that multisig voters that pay for gas get refunded, rather than sending the refund to the multisig contract. Technically, this change involves refunding tx.origin instead of msg.sender.\n\nExact changes can be seen in [this pull request](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/813).\n\nBecause this change is very minor, we're not going through an official audit process. This change has been reviewed by solimander.\n\n## Why this happened\n\nWe started work on V3 before the V2.1 fix, and V3 is in different files so syncing the master branch into the V3 branch did not apply the fix to V3 code.\n\nHere‚Äôs a short sequence of events:\n\n1. September 22, 2022 [v3 branch]: the branch that later becomes DAO V3 is created with initial code experiments.\n2. October 25, 2022 [dao 2.1 branch]: refund bug fixed.\n3. November 2, 2022 [v3 branch]: we sync from master and create a new DAO V3 file.\n4. November 9, 2022 [master] refund fix merged into master, to be deployed.\n5. January 4, 2023 [v3 branch] we sync from master, the refund fix is updated in the DAO V2 file, but we are focused on V3 and do not examine the merge carefully and miss the opportunity to copy the fix into V3.\n6. January 11, 2023 [v3 branch] we split DAO V3 into library files to overcome the contract size limit; this change makes the bug harder to discover, as we lose the ability to directly compare V3 to V2 line for line, as we still could have done between V2 and V1.\n\nAnother problem was that we did not copy or change all V1/V2 tests to test V3; most of the tests were copied to run on V3 as well, but we dropped the ball on the gas refund test.\n\n## How we‚Äôre preventing it from happening again\n\n1. Make sure tests are always running against the latest version.\n2. When merging a fix to master, make sure to correctly merge it into any open branch.\n\nRunning all tests on the latest version is the most important takeaway. As part of working on this fix we made sure all DAO tests are now running on the latest version, and removed old duplicate tests that were testing older versions. We believe we‚Äôve reduced the chances of this happening again significantly.\n\nThe second point is helpful as an extra layer of safety, mostly helpful if we don‚Äôt have sufficient tests or failed to run all tests against the latest version we‚Äôre working on.

We contend that despite the existence of various sub-DAOs, none of them are exclusively dedicated to cultivating the connections and inspiration vital for artists to actively and substantially engage in the Nouns ecosystem. Few subcommunity initiatives manage to captivate the interest of potential new members. The insights from esteemed artists, whom we deeply respect, have contributed to the prominence of several communities and projects. We aim to bring this prominence to Nouns while emphasizing the priority of advancing digital art.\n\n## Overview\n\nDigital art currently finds itself diminished in the broader artistic discourse, prompting our dedication to effecting change in this scenario. We aspire to propel digital art to a pervasive state. The establishment of the Mesmer: A Nouns Council for the Digital Arts emerges as a strategic initiative designed to cultivate widespread appreciation for digital art, fostering education and adoption on a global scale as we support the artists behind it.\n\n*‚ÄúWe're fortunate to have an exceptional team, and together within Nouns Community we're poised to create a lasting legacy in the history of digital art.‚Äù*\n\n## Team\n\n*The concept behind the concept*\n\n\"So I said 'What if we created something very provocative? A sanctuary for artists, but in its broadest interpretation, also a work of art, a creation, and a catalyst for meaningful discourse.\nWhat degree of intrigue generated by anonymity can truly be leveraged as a potent tool? What is the equilibrium of anonymity? Satoshi Nakamoto's execution in this regard was remarkable.\"\n\n**Note:** The project's creators have chosen to maintain their anonymity, prioritizing a focus on the project's message and artistic vision rather than individual recognition.\n\n**Advisors Description;**\nLeaders of the art community, tastemakers, builders, advisors, critics, curators, community supporters and industry art partners.\n\n‚Ä¢ [Noah](https://x.com/cryptopunknoah)\nPrev Brand Lead [CryptoPunks](https://x.com/cryptopunksnfts) and Contemporary Art Specialist [Christie‚Äôs](https://twitter.com/christiesinc) & Founder and Artist [Howlerz](https://x.com/howlerznft)\n\n‚Ä¢ [Alejandro Cartagena](https://twitter.com/halecar2)\nCo-founder and Artist of [Fellowship](https://x.com/fellowshiptrust) & [Obscura](https://x.com/obscuradao).

Patrick initially started as a traditional painter and transitioned to digital art around 2012. He gained recognition for manipulating image files of paintings and photographs, creating captivating animated loops. Patrick is an incredibly influential and powerful voice in the art world.\n\n**Curators Description;**\n\n‚Ä¢ [Micol](https://x.com/micolmicolmicol)\nFounder of [Verticalcrypto](https://x.com/verticalcrypto)\n\n‚Ä¢ [Sofia Garcia](https://x.com/sofiagarcia_io)\nFounder [ARTXCODE](https://x.com/artxcode_io) & [Board Code](https://x.com/codeartorg)/[Art and Art Blocks](https://x.com/artblocks_io)\n\n## Movement\n\nAt the heart of this movement is art, a robust network that isn't assessed by the sheer quantity of connections but by the depth and quality of those connections. It places a premium on authenticity over superficiality, sincerity over pretense, and genuine engagement over mere presence.\n\nSolid networking within the artistic community recognizes the power of reciprocity, where giving and contributing to your network leads to receiving in return. It nurtures a sense of community where individuals support each other's aspirations, exchange ideas, and create opportunities. This movement is grounded in that when one artist prospers, the entire network reaps the benefits.\n\nThe Mesmer extends its influence across various domains. In the realm of knowledge, it fuels innovation and sparks fresh collaborative dialogues. In the world of arts, it propels the creation of innovative works through interdisciplinary partnerships.\n\nThis movement transcends the pursuit of extensive proliferation; it's about valuing quality and the long term, stability over flux, unity over division. It's about the enchantment that blossoms when diverse minds come together to pursue shared objectives.\n\nAs we navigate this digital age, the Mesmer serves as a reminder that art embodies an authentic movement and the most robust foundation for connections. It underscores the enduring value of impactful, long-term construction. In a world teeming with artists, this movement upholds the notion that art serves as both the point of origin and the ultimate destination, the bedrock of our triumph and contentment.\n\n## Rationale\n\nFinance a program/council that establishes a foundation for other projects with the aim of promoting art and providing a secure space for artists and digital art. (1) aesthetic diversification beyond the illustrative premise, (2) create a culture where the meme is implemented and placed in solid proliferation.\n\n*‚ÄúWhat moves men of genius, or rather what inspires their work, is not new ideas, but their obsession with the idea that what has already been said is still not enough.‚Äù*\n\\- Eugene Delacroix\n\n## Aesthetic diversification beyond the illustrative premise\n\nThe world of digital art is currently undergoing a significant and innovative transformation. At its core lies the meme ‚Äì a seemingly straightforward yet incredibly adaptable form of cultural expression. It appears as a flaw to me that the art within Nouns is predominantly characterized by an illustrative premise or animations. Memes are inherently multifaceted, effortlessly adjusting to diverse cultural contexts, languages, and trends. As such, the meme stands as an artistic formula that transcends boundaries, championing inclusivity and encouraging artists from various backgrounds to engage.\n\n*‚ÄúI really appreciate the idea of Nouns pushing into different art styles.‚Äù*\n\\- [willpapper](https://twitter.com/willpapper) (nouner)\n\n*‚Äúi'm generally here for us diversifying the way nouns shows up‚Äù*\n\\- [Jesse Pollak](https://twitter.com/jessepollak) (nouner)\n\n*‚ÄúI think showing the diversity of nouns brand to go beyond cute characters‚Äù*\n\\- [brennen](https://twitter.com/brennen_eth) (nouner)\n\n\\- Case study: Sensuality in Art\n\nOn the heels of [Prop 392‚Äôs](https://nouns.wtf/vote/392) The theme of sensuality, chosen for its delicate nature, served as a canvas for interpretation and became the subject of data research to understand the meme's applicability and the community's perspective on such sensitivity.\n\n‚ÄúIt is highly gratifying to witness the execution of the initial objective and the impact it generated, similar to major discussions such as fork and burn, the community's interest and the division of opinions regarding nounish applications in art is remarkable. The feedback provided, along with the articles published, has been deeply valued and considered in shaping our overall narrative. We have read each one with great appreciation.‚Äù\n\n## A culture where the meme is implemented and placed in solid proliferation\n\n***A monthly grant for digital art. Supports 12 Artists for 6 months, and the artist gets the prestige of being in the program. (This results in a total support of $50,000 for each artist.)***\n\n- Abstract Operational Process for monthly grant:\n\nWith the assistance of our curators, a careful selection will be made of the 12 most exceptional and inventive artists who could have nounish inspirations. These artists are anticipated to create and interpret nouns in the most unique way according to their individual artistic visions. They will produce pieces within their respective domains of art, leading to a grand exhibition at the program's conclusion.\n\n*‚ÄúI'm eager to see which artists will be selected. Personally, I'm a big fan of [XCOPY](https://twitter.com/XCOPYART), and I'd be thrilled to witness one of his unique pieces inspired by Nounish.‚Äù*\n\n- Educational Opportunities:\n\nThe program establishes an educational pathway, offering workshops and outreach initiatives that enable artists to impart their expertise and skills to the wider community. Distinguished guests also bring valuable knowledge to the artists. Spaces with guests and other artists will be held every 15 days.\n\n*‚ÄúArt prevails over the artists who create it and the initiatives that sustain this ecosystem, daring to experiment extensively. While I may not possess knowledge about Nouns or NFTs, but I do have some well-formed ideas about the digital art movement that I can share. I'm here for anything you need.‚Äù*\n\\- Anne Laure ( Director Department of Externals Affairs - Mus√©e du Louvre )\n\n***Nounish Friday (Weekly Artistic Celebration): Every week we acquire $2,000 of art nounish.***\n\n- Abstract Operational Process for Nounish Friday:\n\nEvery Friday for six months we will announce on our twitter profile that we are selecting 3 pieces to add to the Nounish Art Vault. Each week, we will invite nouners, notable personalities, esteemed collectors, artists, critics and external guests to participate as our weekly curators. These people will have the privilege of choosing the works of the week and giving a few words about their selections, which will be published on profile every Sunday along with the chosen works.\n\nThis process represents a double honor for the artist: his creation shines under the unique choices made by our illustrious guests. The featured artists of the week will receive a guaranteed financial incentive through the selected pieces.\n\n- Specifications:\n\nThe Nounish Art Vault serves as a safe place where all pieces collected in Nounish Friday will be housed. This way, after the implementation of this program, we will have a vast and varied collection that can be utilized by other nounish projects, exhibitions, and in-person events organized by other builders.\n\n---\n\n## Benefit to NounsDAO Ecosystem\n#\n- **Future support of the artists from the team**\n\nBeyond the contours of a grant program, our commitment resonates on a profound level. The individuals steering this project are not just advisors and curators; they are visionaries, founders deeply ingrained in the art space. These are individuals with their own projects, daily immersed in supporting artists and various programs. Encountering such an opportunity aligns seamlessly with our beliefs and identity. It transcends the soul of grant programs, extending into a space of rich experience, extensive networking, and coveted access‚Äîtraits cultivated over years at the heart of the art scene, by our team members.\n\nOur involvement goes beyond the grant phase; it's a pledge to personally invest in sustaining the cultural relevance of this project. It involves channeling collective efforts to secure strong collectors, galleries, museums and aspire for inclusion in esteemed institutional collections. As [exemplified by Alejandro's fellowship program](https://x.com/halecar2/status/1718789945857298785), where works found a home at [MOMA](https://twitter.com/MuseumModernArt). We are resolute in our dedication to ensure these works endure as culturally significant entities in the ever-evolving landscape of digital art, etching a lasting presence in the zeitgeist of our space.\n\n\n*Notes:* To start a grant program based on the productions of new art works permits a creation of a legacy. There will be possibilities to create stories, with NOUNS at the center of it, of the different generations that have passed through the program, the interconnections between the different artworks created in the program, the life changing opportunities that the grant will mean to the artists. The life of the grant lives on in all places where these artworks created during the grant period circulate in the artworld. When placed in museums, when collected, when awards are won; all these future moments will be opportunities for the NOUNS brand to proliferate to new places and new eyes.\n\n- **Expansion of Interest/New Members for Nouns: Collectors are to artists they resonate with, as artists are to the art they create.**\n\nIn one of our researches aligned with the created thesis, the current population of art collectors predominantly has [cryptopunks](https://twitter.com/cryptopunksnfts) in their portfolio, actively interacting with them, in addition, a significant portion of collectors express interest in any group or project that supports artists and can potentially become part of such a community.\n\nA substantial number of collectors have a comprehensive understanding of what Nouns represent, and a considerable percentage of them express disinterest because the artists in their collections are not part of such a community, this profile reflects collectors in general. Notably, there is a significant correlation between collectors participating in projects and the frequency with which artists mention them, resulting in higher levels of interactions within the space overall.\n\nEvery collector fondly remembers the initial piece they acquired, although the meaning of that first purchase is different. Many collectors make their first purchase after hearing mentions of specific projects from other collectors and artists. For a significant portion of collectors, the first piece obtained provided them access to a community that aligns with their visions and expectations of artists.\n\n\n*‚ÄúI love nouns and loved what [Dustin Yellin](https://twitter.com/dustinyellin) x [Artmatr](https://twitter.com/artmatrco). I'm watching what's happening and seeing how it overall affects the community and market.‚Äù*\n\\- [Sebastian](https://twitter.com/sebastianss527) (Digital Art at [Christie‚Äôs](https://twitter.com/christiesinc))\n\n\nIn the panorama of Nouns and its ongoing projects, a notable gap becomes evident ‚Äì the absence of initiatives specifically crafted to attract new members. While other developers prioritize proliferation, they fall short on projects tailored to a broader audience that significantly lacks the funds necessary to become a nouner. This observation carries particular weight when considering the broader view that the Ethereum injection brought by new members is a key factor for sustaining activation projects and proliferations to other audiences. This shift in focus considers a niche audience not commonly found at broad events or activations but existing within small communities of collectors, founders, and creators. The common thread uniting these groups is a shared appreciation for art, in essence, collectors who hold funds for such allocations.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/UWJKvmI.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/f9MJMAP.jpg)\n*CryptoPunk #110 Centre Pompidou Museum, Paris*\n\n*Notes:* To have this program be successful will open the possibility of a new generation of possible nouners with philanthropic pursuits to join the community. The program is a permanent promotional tool of the NOUNS values through the artists they support. The organic nature of how this works makes for the best advocacy program ever.\n\n- **Impact on the Nouns Brand**\n\nIn a long-term perspective, envisioning that with the execution of this project, Nouns can serve as an exemplary patron for all other projects in the space. It's a visualization possibility that can be considered a \"moment in history.\"\n\n\nWhen contemplating the team involved in this proposal, the depth of experience each member possesses within the art space presents the opportunity to craft distinct narratives. For instance, envisioning a Noun being regarded as a piece of art, displayed in a museum, becomes a plausible prospect. This possibility echoes what was achieved with Cryptopunk at the ICA Museum. The pivotal aspect here is that this project allows for the creation of a narrative, sparking interest and establishing a profound presence within the art space. In the long-term execution, the Nouns brand is cultivated within this narrative.\n\nA recent contemplation revolves around the fact that, despite the remarkable characteristics of Nouns, they are not commonly perceived as works of art. It's an unexplored visualization, which may explain the absence of discussions about Prints among Noun collectors. Nouns Prints are not something they currently visualize adding to the walls of their homes.\n\n**In general terms, we should consider this for conceptual and value structure:**\n\nOne of the things that can also be very attractive to NOUNS and to artists is a framework. What type of conceptual parameters will be explored in the program? Think of this like if you were to join a computer learning program. You would be expected to explore freely but have all work circle back to the core values of computer learning. So to land this in the NOUNS, we need to ask:\n\nWhat are NOUNS conceptually?\nWhat are NOUNS aesthetically?\nWhat are NOUNS in the context of generative art and the history of art?\n\n*For me, the general answers are around these ideas or values:*\n\n-Randomization\n-Collage\n-Seriality\n-Generative art\n-Community\n\nSo in that sense, we build the open call based on those values. It is open to all art practices, but we are looking for artists who want to a)continue to explore these values they already have in their art or b)artists who are interested in exploring their art in the context of these values.\n\nBy doing so, we are creating NOUNS art. Art that is in line with the values of NOUNS. This creates two effects: it validates NOUNS as art and makes these values cross-pollinate with other art forms that may have never considered these values (cinema, video, photography etc). \n\nThough this might seem limiting, it is actually value-centered. Parameters for artists are important and will filter from the start those artists who are willing to commit and expand their vision and welcome those who are interested in the NOUNS values.\n\n---\n\n## Program Organization\n\n1- Open call\n2- Mentorship\n3- Artist conversations\n4- Artist presentations\n5- Monthly work reviews\n\n**Operational Process Breakdown**\n\n1- Open call\n\n*How will we conduct the Open Call for the artist grant?*\n\n- **Awareness:**\n   - 4-week submission timeline\n   - Social media campaign\n   - Weekly Twitter and Instagram posts from all team members + friends with instructions for open-call submissions\n   - @NounsDAO account repost\n   - Strategic 1:1 outreach to artists and communities for encouragement to apply\n   - Weekly public discussions (Twitter spaces, Discord) to answer any questions about the grant and program\n\n- **Application Process**\n   - Define submission dates i.e. December 1, 2023 - December 31, 2023\n   - Create a micro-site that provides concrete instructions for artists to submit proposals and perhaps outlines the project a bit more (who the team is, timeline, and further project details)\n   - Set up a dedicated e-mail address for the submissions\n   - Curators review applications and determine a shortlist of artists for review with the larger team\n   - Weekly meetings with the team to review artist selections throughout the open-call process\n\n- **Example Artist submission form:**\n\n  - Basic info - name, location, social handles\n  - Proposed project overview\n  - Portfolio of 1 or 2 past projects (this is a great filter to see if they have a sense of their artistry)\n  - How do you plan on using the funds to realize the project?\n  - Project Timeline\n  - How the proposal reflects the ethos of the Nouns community\n  - Any other key information i.e.\n      - One (or a few) of the works created will be stored in the Nouns art collection vault\n      - Minimum requirement of works to be created \n\n- **We need to create phases in the process:**\n \n   - Administrative: Applications not complying with the solicited materials get discarded for fairness to all other that do\n   - Review: We all review independently the applications and we can create a simple voting system of 1-5. Best scored projects go to the next phase\n   - Group review: Sessions to advocate for and elucidate projects that we perceive as robust. The final selection of candidates should occur here. -Financial review. We need to come to a consensus about the monetary allocation for each project accepted\n\n*How will we select the artists?*\n\n- **Selection Criteria**\n\n   - Portfolio assessment: artist practice, background, body of work, past work \n   - Dedication to grant application / project: assess how invested the artist is in participating in the project with the quality of the answers in the open call \n   - Project assessment based on:\n      \\- Technical \n      \\- Idea \n      \\- Feasibility \n      \\- Impact on Nouns brand and community \n      \\- Future application (consider the longevity of the project)\n      \\- Resonance with the wider art ecosystem (will it resonate with the audience we are going for?)\n   - Artist profile: where to they come from (we want to be inclusive and build a global program but at the same time due due diligence on the applicants) \n\n- **Things to consider:**\n\n   - Tiered funding approach based on project ambitions?\n   - Tier: ‚ÄúNew Voices‚Äù for emerging artists. It could be a range (From $$ to $$$)\n   - Tier: ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù for working artists with trajectory. Also with a range. \n\nRange permits us to individually value the scope of the project and not over allocate resources to projects that do not require so many funds.\n\nCreate a ‚Äúcancel of the grant‚Äù clause in the open call. I¬¥ve been part of many grant programs and I¬¥ve felt that the ones that have that option tend to have more committed artists. Artists can get entangled and not produce work and for us as a program, would be damaging. Every artist should deliver a project at the end of the grant period. This is absolutely necessary for our longevity.\n\n2- Mentorship phase. \n\nIn this phase the artists that have passed through to be part of the program will have a 1-1 meeting to brainstorm with all curators and advisors. This is needed so that each artist will have a connection and a broad range of reactions to their proposed projects.\n\n3- Artists Conversation\n\nWe invite artists to do group zoom presentations with all the artists. These artists will present their work and motivate the grant artists through how they talk about their creative process, how they build their projects and how they navigate the life of being an artist. We should have at least one a month. These are moments to motivate the artist. The artists we bring should be charismatic and enthusiastic in order to convey their message.\n\n4- Artist presentations\n\nThere should be at three group presentations via zoom where the artists present their projects. One should be at the start of the grant, in the conceptual phase where the projects ar just ideas, a second at the middle of the grant to show the advances of the proposal and the last one as a conclusion of the project. These presentations should motivate the artists to work as they will have to be public about what they are doing and how much effort and proof of work they have for the grant and support they are receiving.\n\n5- Monthly work reviews\n\nEach artist should have a monthly 1-1 meeting with the curators in order to receive concise feedback to the work they are doing. The curator should receive the work previous to the meeting in order to bring to the meeting strong feedback that will help the artist in their pursuit.\n\n---\n\n## CC0\n\nWe will take the initiative to acquaint artists with the significance of CC0, enabling them to decide whether their pieces will be made available under this license or not.\n\nWe hold a shared viewpoint regarding the significance of CC0 for all projects within nouns. However, we acknowledge that each artist may have a distinct perspective on this matter. This is why we opt to offer them a comprehensive introduction to the subject and grant them the autonomy to decide how it applies to their work.\n\n## Transparency\n\nAll funds will be transparently deposited and utilized through the multisig that governs the Mesmer.\n\nIn total, we have five signatories: Two advisors, a trusted nouner, the project sponsor (who is also a nouner), and one of the project's creators.\n\n**Signatories:**\n[Brennen](https://twitter.com/brennen_eth)\n[Alejandro](https://twitter.com/halecar2)\n[Noah](https://twitter.com/cryptopunknoah)\n[Bigint](https://twitter.com/0xbigint)\nProject Creator\n\n***\n\n## Overall Cost\n\n$1,396,000 USDC\n\n*Budget Breakdown*\n\n**Artistry Spotlight - $654,000**\n- A monthly grant for Digital Art.\n$50k x 12 (6 months, each grant totals $50k per artists/ distributed in that period) - $600k\n- Nounish Friday\n$2k x 27 (3 pieces per week/ 6 months/ 27 Fridays) - $54k\n\n**Strategic Vision $553k / 8 months**\n\n- *Advisors Fees - $352k ($11000 per advisor / per month)*\n\n  - Feedback and evaluation\n  - Communication and targeting\n  - Creative oversight\n\n- *Curators Fees - $128k ($8000 per curator / per month)*\n\n  - Curation and relationship with artists\n  - Overseeing and managing\n  - Acquisitions and Deaccessioning\n  - Collection Management and Documentation\n\n- *Strategic guest fees - $40k ($5000k per month)*\n\n  - Communication traction\n  - Organic number planning\n  - Feedback and evaluation\n\n- *Community Manager fees - $33k ($4125k per month)*\n\n  - Engagement and Moderation\n  - Feedback Gathering\n  - Community Building\n\n**Management - $0k / 8 months**\n\nAs creators and founders, we have opted to forgo the budget initially earmarked for our compensation/project management fees. This choice places a significant emphasis on the message and strengthens the artistic vision of the project, prioritizing it over individual recognition. \n\nNevertheless, we propose that a portion of the budget designated for us be redirected towards the production of a concise 15-minute documentary.\n\n- *Production and execution of the short documentary - 80K*\n\n  - Production of a 15-minute video that is highly engaging, enabling each of us to discuss our accomplishments during the program in detail. This includes critiques, processes, artist perspectives, and emphasizes the significance of the next steps. It should be exceptionally well-done, immersive, artistic, and intellectually engaging.\n\n- *Senior Managing Director - $0k*\n\n  - Project Leadership and Planning\n  - Stakeholder Engagement\n  - Committee Assignments\n\n- *Director General - $0k*\n\n  - Relations with Galleries.\n  - Operational Oversight\n  - Performance Monitoring\n  - Risk Management\n  - Reporting and Accountability\n\n**General Operations - $109k / 8 months**\n\nGallerist - $17K ($2125k per month)\nSocial Media Mgr - $20K ($2500k per month)\nLegal+Accounting - $20K ($2500k per month)\nAssistant - $22K ($2750k per month)\nWeb build and upkeep - $30K ($3750k per month)\n\n## Timeline\n\n**Nounish Friday (Weekly Artistic Celebration)**\n\n- December 2023: Team preparation, promotional activities, and artist call commence.\n- January 5, 2024: Program initiation, with the first event on the first Friday of the month.\n- Ongoing from January 2024: Weekly cycles of activities to maintain continual engagement with both artists and the community, ensuring a organic growth and dynamic and vibrant program.\n\n**A monthly grant for digital art**\n\n- December 2023: Curatorship commences the selection process for participating artists.\n- January 20, 2024: Announcement of the selected artists, accompanied by short video presentations.\n- January 2024 to June 2024: Six months of comprehensive mentoring provided to the chosen artists by our advisors and curators.\n- June 2024: Conclusion of the 6-month program.

I think given the fact that Nouns holds substantial funds (+their reach and reputation within the community) it would be a great way to support artists, and art, with its substantial number of collectors, contributes to the Nouns ecosystem.

One key factor to bear in mind is the delicate balance between financial support and the prestige associated with participation. These two elements often intertwine to make such programs successful. Therefore, it is essential to recognize that artists, at various stages of their careers, have distinct needs when it comes to funding and recognition.\n\nFor emerging artists who are just beginning their journey, the appeal of participation and the prestige it brings can be more critical than receiving substantial funding. Their participation adds a sense of freshness and vitality to the program, contributing to its overall appeal. This synergy benefits both the emerging artists and the program itself, creating a dynamic and mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, more established artists may require a more substantial financial injection into their projects. These artists often carry ambitious visions that necessitate a greater level of funding. Their involvement brings a wealth of experience and influence to the program, further enhancing its reputation.\n\nAs we consider the program's structure, it is prudent to adopt a tiered system of support that caters to the diverse needs of artists. Such a model should not only address the artists' requirements but also leverage the network effect. The network effect relies on the concept that having fewer established artists can generate significant prestige for the program, while having a larger number of emerging artists strengthens the perception of the program as a staunch supporter of the arts.\n\nIn our perspective, a balanced distribution that favors a higher number of emerging artists can serve as a robust and equitable model. It bolsters the emergence of fresh talent and ensures a steady influx of innovative ideas. Simultaneously, it can leverage the prestige generated by established artists to further enhance the program's reputation and reach.\n\nThis project should aim to find the equilibrium between these elements, fostering an environment where emerging and established artists can coexist and thrive. By recognizing the distinct funding and prestige requirements at various career stages, we can create a program that resonates with both artists and the broader artistic community, ultimately enhancing the vibrancy and sustainability of the arts.\n\n## What comes next?\n\nUpon the program's completion, we will draft a new proposal for the main event, extending an invitation to the entire NFT community to experience the artworks of the 12 selected artists. This proposal will outline the event's execution.\n\nIn the future, following the completion of this program, we aspire to delve deeper into the narrative. We plan to create a documentary about the selected artists, exploring their backgrounds, inspirations, and gathering their thoughts on the experience of being part of this program. ‚ÄúMesmer: The Council\" will be a 12-part documentary, with each episode dedicated to the story of one of the artists featured in the program.\n\nOur concept of art is deeply entwined with individual identity, a driving force behind much of cultural enthusiasm. In this endeavor, we aim to expand and emphasize the influence of personal history. While there is a wealth of knowledge about the artist's work, we seek to uncover the person behind these creations. What inspires them, and what is their creative process like? What is their life story?\n\n\"Mesmer: The Council\" is a unique exploration of creativity. By delving into each artist's identity and artistic journey, we hope to uncover something more profound. This involves masterfully navigating the intricacies of their craft while staying connected to universal themes through a personal perspective. It's quite remarkable to consider how humans have transformed art into an extension of the revolutionary essence of life, and art into an extension of technology.\n\n***\n\nWe extend a gracious invitation for you to consider listening to the recording of our conversation with Brennen, Toady Hawk, and Joshua Fisher on Talking Props.

While we have funded numerous groundbreaking proposals since the DAO‚Äôs inception (such as Budweiser Super Bowl ad, the Rose Parade, Nouns E-sports) we‚Äôve also encountered projects trying to take advantage of the DAO and it‚Äôs funds as well as builders that raised concerns within the community by not communicating effectively during the development phase.\n\nEven though we have many Nounish data dashboards and tools, we‚Äôve realised that the tracking and evaluation process of funded proposals is not as efficient as it should. Additionally, solely relying on builders to submit reports voluntarily is not effective, leading to suboptimal results. What we lack is a bridge that fills the transparency gap between funded projects and the community.\n\nWe need to establish a set of proposal tracking and evaluation standards based on data, maintain regular communication with funded projects to encourage accountability throughout the community and have a place where all those info are available to everyone 24/7.\n\n![1](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJKfcxiVa.jpg)\n\n\n# **How?**\nWe‚Äôre proposing to establish ThePASS team (the team behind a prominent [DAO aggregator](https://thepass.to/) and [analytical](https://dune.com/thepass) platform) as an accountability third-party service to keep track of each funded project progress by:\n\n**[1]** analyzing the progress of funded proposals by creating a comprehensive evaluation and accountability system\n**[2]** regularly communicating with builders to ensure proposal progress\n**[3]** archiving project updates and compile them into monthly reports\n**[4]** hosting monthly Nounish Townhalls where builders, community and special guests discuss the progress of funded props\n\n![4](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkl7oejE6.png)\n\n\nThis approach offers several benefits such as:\n* Insights to the building process of funded projects\n* Solid data we can refer to in future decision-making\n* Recognition to the best builders\n* Attract new contributors and investors\n\n***We‚Äôre not aiming to be another proposal updates platform but the ‚Äúbridge‚Äù between builders and the community ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®***\n\n# **Execution**\n\n**[1] Evaluation system/Proposal Analysis**\n\nHaving a standard evaluation system ensures fairness and objectivity in the evaluation process as well as helps with accurate measurement, boosts transparency, and assists in making more informed decisions thanks to data.\n\nWe have established a ‚ÄòMeasurements Standard‚Äô with specific criteria based on project types.
